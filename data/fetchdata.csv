2023-11-08,"i played portia, a while ago. i've had sandrock on my radar for a while. when i saw that they were intending to put multiplayer in, i thought to myself i can afford to wait until it's actually here. when it dropped, i had time and so did my usual co-op buddies and we jumped into it. one of my friends had played portia and the other had not. 

sandrock has had me gripped for a few days now, and i have only barely touched single player, spending almost all of my time in multiplayer. to those who have played portia, the multiplayer focuses on the gameplay and it delivers. it is very improved over what we had in portia. to those who are not familiar, who are just looking for a game to play with the people they play games with: do you enjoy games like stardew valley or minecraft, where everyone can kinda pick a 'job' and meet up at the house or base at the start and end of the day and spend the middle doing who knows what? if yes, you'll like sandrock. there are things like co-op bounties, co-op forms of the ruins where you hunt treasure, co-op dungeons, what seemed like a raid? (had its own tokens, was timed/scored) sure, after enough time, you're going to  max out your skill tree and start dipping into others, but the join/drop nature of the game (up to four people) means that there's ... often ... a lot to do. if you hit the ground with both feet running, there's tons of jobs to do. you can build yourself into a coma. you can go and make friends with townsfolk. you can try to get rich. 

the urban planning mechanic is well thought out and it works well. i'd maybe twist the ranching store to come online a little earlier (by the time i unlocked ranching it felt like i was so late in the tree that it only existed as a means to get yak hair) but it's fun. it's fun to build your workshop and build your house and build your skills and build your relationships. it's fun. there is no overarching story in multiplayer but you do iterate on the town through how you progress your commissions and by doing the urban planner. it's a good game for hangin' out with the guys. really.

as for the progression? it can be kinda hard, at times. not the combat, but figuring out where to get very specific tidbits you'll need. and the building commissions start to ramp up when you roam around the map. sometimes, you don't have the ability to get or refine the things you need for the commissions. i've constantly opened the wiki to guide me in the game, which is something i do for a lot of games, but i know some people are dead set against it.

also, relationships with npcs move slow. sometimes, i can't find the people i am looking for. there's a lot to learn how to do in this game because there's a lot to learn how to do. i still only know like four food recipes. there are sometimes minor bugs but i am guessing they'll get ironed out soon enough. nothing so serious as a crash or any lost progress. it's not a perfect game, but it's better than portia, which i already thought was good. and if you're into the genre, it's absolutely worth picking up.",15199
2023-11-08,probably one of the most fun games i've played in a year that's seen so many great titles. my buddy and i play this every night and there are so many interesting twists and turns. the npc's almost seem to have and pursue their own lives while constantly walking around and creating a lively atmosphere reminiscent of the sims. great job pathea games!,15199
2023-11-08,"if you liked my time in portia, then this is more of that, polished and with new features. it's a cute crafting game with combat, some building, many characters and story.

the gameplay in the beginning can feel restricted and slow, and you have to rush to meet your daily goals. this does of course become easier and can be tweaked with game settings and mods if you want.

the story is overall lighthearted and often silly, but does have some underlying messages and darker tones.

between gathering resources, crafting, dungeons and many events, you can easily sink many hours into this game. i am currently 27 hours in and feel like i have barely started.",15199
2023-11-08,"a nice follow-up on portia. some nice qol stuff, and the characters are more varied and the story seems a little deeper and better told. i do suspect that if i hadn't played portia i would have been a little lost at understanding the game systems and the flow of play, and portia was polished enough that i would recommend you play both games in sequence rather than jumping to this one.",15199
2023-11-08,"the trailer is very misleading, bought this with my girlfriend expecting that it's singleplayer with multiplayer but apparently it's 2 different game modes, the multiplayer being just endless grinding of contracts with no story. the game is great otherwise but i'm very disappointed that they advertise it in such an unclear (and yes only after i bought it i read the ""multiplayer release"" announcement which is 6 months old) and almost scummy way.",15199
2023-11-08,"man, i was so excited to play this game with my boyfriend until we discovered that the multiplayer is just an endless grind without any story. unfortunately this meant that the game is not what they led to believe it is and therefore not worth the money. we thought we would get a cozy stardew valley - kind of game with cute graphics and story, but there is no point in the multiplayer if it's just running around and grinding materials.",15199
2023-11-06,"very good game! the developers continued on their first idea (my time at portia) and vastly improved on it. there is no need to have played the previous game to enjoy this one. it got great characters, nice story, never a dull moment, crafting, grinding, farming, ranching, mining, sandfishing it got levels, relationship, events and you build stuff that are in the game world and not just on your land bit everywhere. i absolutely loved my time at portia and my time at sandrock is just amazing. can't leave the game alone. so looking forward to see what comes next!",16388
2023-11-05,this is a very charming farm/crafting sim with a pleasant art style. the occasional combat is also fairly enjoyable even if the combo system is really basic. i've been here for 5 hours (no early access since i wasn't interested in the prequel and didn't expect a sequel) but apparently there's like 30+ hours for the main story alone which is great for the price tag especially considering how invested you can get in some of the side stuff.,19735
2023-11-08,if your a fan of my time at portia this is that but better,15199
2023-11-08,i have this on nintendo switch also love this and my time in portia,15199
2023-11-08,juegazooooo,15199
2023-11-08,very much addicting/chaotic gotta-go and gotta-do game. such a fun game.,15199
2023-11-08,"it's nice. hits all the right notes for a fun and engaging farming/crafting sim. cute character designs and i personally enjoyed the story.

janky and buggy, though. combat's bad and i got soft-locked in cutscenes a few times and had to relaunch the game. i still recommend it, just get friendly with the quick-save key if you play this.",15199
2023-11-08,this is crack,15199
2023-11-08,"i'm so sane and normal about this game, it's true",15199
2023-11-08,this game is a lot of fun with friends or solo,15199
2023-11-08,"this is one of the best life simulator games i have ever played, hands down! it does have a few minor problems but they're barely notable and the pros here far outweigh any cons.

what i think...

+ pros +
++++++++
+ beautiful visuals and characters
+ astounding game mechanics
+ tons and i do mean tons to do for hours on end
+ awesome crafting system
+ awesome building/upgrade system
+ easy to understand and play
+ challenging enemies
+ lots of quests and side missions
+ mail system that actually makes sense and lets you respond
+ town news that makes sense, you can subscribe to get updates on things happening in town
+ finally, a town that feels and looks legit, lots of stores, an arcade, and more
+ lots of mini games and events
+ lots of glorious cutscenes
+ feels very realistic in a lot of ways
+ gameplay draws you in a lot
+ lots of collectibles
+ lots of areas
+ singleplayer and multiplayer
+ lots of replay value


- cons -
----------
- multiplayer starts of with no house and a lot of missing buildings, this makes absolutely no sense
- controls in multiplayer are by default different than singleplayer, this too makes absolutely no sense
- player water tower to refill with water should have a visual meter to indicate water in it since it's extremely annoying just to have to open it up to check ever time and that makes it difficult to know if you're running low or not while busy with other town commisions and such. a simple visual meter on the side of the tank would make life so much better.
- a lot of the pop-ups such as hints/tips from quests and wandering around show up during cutscenes and can easily be missed as they don't stay there long so you might miss something important and thats very frustating


= verdict =
==========
= my time at sandrock takes everything about the first game and makes it even better plus a little more! there is literally so much detail and realism packed into this wonderful stylized game to keep you busy with the game for hours on end and when you think it stops no it doesn't you can take things on again pretty much through continued multiplayer! its a wonderful game with so many great gameplay machanics and you'll never want to put it down! i highly recommend it! i really hope to see this game come to android as well like the first one did! i would buy it on mobile in a heartbeat! thanks devs for making this amazing game! 
",15199
2023-11-08,"farmtastic. just like the first one, only better!
simple, elegant, zero impacting bugs. not finished yet, but a pleasure to play.
",15199
2023-11-08,"was an early supporter of this game because i loved my time at portia. sandrock is just as amazing as portia, i feel like portia and sandrock are the only games of its kind. panthea never fails, this one, just like portia was full of twist, full of love-able and hate-able characters. the bachelors are top tier, same with some of the bachelorettes. a lot is improved from portia, i feel like there's way more sentiments for the characters and i actually think this game felt longer then portia. it was really fun trying to stop the desertification, and its always fun to be able to fight against duvos, like the first game. if another game comes along in this series (pc/console game, i know there's a mobile, which ill probably play too). i will 100% buy, i know they teased as an april fools my time at duvos, which, since that's a city under a dictatorship and is the problem for most of the free cities, my god, would be amazing. i know they have a lot of towns they can work with, through both games and hopefully there's more to the story, more games in the future, because i am invested.",15199
2023-11-08,my time in portia and my time in sandrock are really great cozy games. i 100% recommend !,15199
2023-11-08,"bits of animal crossing, bits of stardew valley.  yet something totally unique.  if you like either, you will like this.",15199
2023-11-08,"only a few hours in and it seems to be a decent gathering, building, and construction game.",15199
2023-11-08,"really good enjoyable relaxing experience.. its a good chill pill to something like sekiro or dark souls games... there is depth in the game, but the depth is in getting more efficient at building and progressing but there are hardly any penalties which makes this game, great to play. highly recommended to people that are looking for a relaxing cool down experience. bonus points for multiplayer where you can have 4 friends doing co-op missions and building stuff together. its great fun.",15199
2023-11-08,lots of fun and lots to do highly recommend,15199
2023-11-08,"i only found out about this series about a week ago and holy cow, mtas is the next-gen 3d farm/life game i've always wanted since playing stardew valley. 

the npcs and characters have so much heart/quirk/personality and the game never takes itself too seriously with incredibly comedic and heartfelt quests, story, plot twists, and more. all the characters are so memorable and get fleshed out in incredible side quests that had my partner and i laughing out loud or audibly ""awww!""-ing.

building, sound design, graphics, combat, exploration, skill progression, pacing and more have made this game both incredibly addicting and relaxing, with some amazing quality-of-life changes over the typical farm/life/survival/etc sim games i haven't seen before.

10/10 and can't wait to 10x my current playtime.",15199
2023-11-07,cute game.,15801
2023-11-07,"love that i'm able to fix up and expand a town, just what i was looking for! cant wait till they add more stuff for multiplayer!",15801
2023-11-07,"i honestly love this game. i had played portia long after its release, so i knew i wanted to play this game when it was in early access. i have over 100 hours of game play and probably still have a decent amount to play though :). 

the plot is so good, and keeps you very interested. i love the villagers and their quirks. overall i would easily give it a 8/10.",15801
2023-11-07,bing chilling,15801
2023-11-07,is fun,15801
2023-11-07,"awesuhm. x
cheers, good game, beautiful. 
",15801
2023-11-07,"like exploration and hate invisible walls impeding exploration?  then, this game is not for you.

0/1, devs need to learn invisible walls are always bad design.  make interesting barriers or give an actual reason instead of invisible walls.

also, multiplayer feels like a completely different game than singleplayer.  there's not feature parity between the two, and many mechanics work differently for crafting and combat.

0/1, devs need to get feature consistency and parity between the two game modes.

movement is also very uncontrollable on keyboard and mouse.  my time at portia did movement better as your character had an infinitesimal turn radius, whereas in sandrock you will have a turn radius, which makes precision quite difficult.

0/1, devs need to revert the movement system to my time at portia.

the only thing this game has going so far is its multiplayer, because it's fun to strategize resource production.  however, my time at portia is the overall better game in very many respects.

overall:

0/1 for singleplayer; and
0/1-1/1 for multiplayer, if you have a group to play with.

if my time at portia had multiplayer (even a mod), this game would not be worthwhile.",15801
2023-11-08,"this game deserves more attention! although my time at portia was a rough-edged gem that i still enjoyed quite a lot, sandrock greatly improves on its predecessor in almost every way. the town and characters are brimming with personality, the story is great, the quests feel meaningful, and overall the game just feels good to play. the quality-of-life improvements over the original are significant, especially regarding storage. combat still isn't perfect, though it's significantly better this time around. there is just so much to do in this game, and the loop is very addictive and fun!

if you never played portia, it's a bit hard to describe this game. it's not a ""farming game"", although you can do a bit of that. rather, you are a builder. you salvage, mine, gather, and refine materials, and use those to make and build whatever the town's inhabitants request. there is a heavy focus on characters, relationships, and story, in addition to the surprisingly interesting crafting system. the requests and commissions range from small items, to pieces of furniture, to useful structures that actually get placed permanently in the environment. you, your home (inside and out), and your yard are all highly customizable. almost everything you wear actually shows on your character, too, which is pretty neat!

the desert setting is more than just a backdrop, too. farming is a challenge. sandstorms are a threat. in order to keep your crafting machines running smoothly, you must keep them fueled, clean of sand, and cooled with water. collection and conservation of water is important in this game, not only as a theme, but also in practice. it should be tedious, but somehow it's not, i think due to just how well they implemented this ""you are living in a desert"" theme overall.

the only two negatives i can think of are a bit of lag as things load in when transitioning areas, and the often charmingly-awkward voice acting. neither of these are enough to even dampen my experience, though. i truly hope this is only the second in a long series of my time games!",15199
2023-11-07,my time at sandrock takes everything portia did right and makes it 5x better. this game is a masterpiece.,15801
2023-11-07,fun and cozy game,15801
2023-11-07,"game is good, but i keep running into fucking real world advertisements all over the place in the game, advertising their youtube channel, their store on amazon, advertising leaving a steam review, etc. well, it worked, here is your review",15801

2023-11-07,i want owen and rocky to pin me down.,15801
2023-11-07,"i played a bit in ea, but just started again after 1.0 release. this game is long, but i really am enjoying it. the dialog with some of the characters is so charming and funny to me. early game stamina is an issue like most games but with one problem, the food does little to nothing to help. other than that, i think this game is awesome. there is a lot of depth here in terms of intermingling with the characters, which adds an extra layer to your experience with them. i love the details, for example; my character changed her hair and the npcs noticed and commented on it. small stuff like this really adds to the simulation aspect of this game. i never seem to get bored or have nothing to do and when i do get those rare moments off, i actually enjoy just roaming around and talking to people or exploring. its definitely a worth while game if you like cozy simulation, rpg games. but word of warning to those that love farming... the farming plays a very minor role in the game in terms of progress, even though it is available. combat is more extensive than usual cozy games and animations for it are vivid. relationships (though i havent explored that much) are pretty involved, and building design is a bit tricky at first but offers lots of customisation. the game is just fun. it offers lots of small references to its predecessor, my time at portia (i didnt play it) which is cute for those players that did play that game. i would say it is definitely worth a playthrough if this is your type of game.",15801
2023-11-07,multiplayer with family and friends is actually good,15801
2023-11-07,its fun and enjoyable. perfect if you don't want a complicated game and you just want to chill and forget life,15801
2023-11-07,"great game, absolutely love it. i'm now on my 3rd or 4th play-through (others on epic games) now i just need to try and not deforest the whole outback again.
also great with controller (elite series 2) or keyboard (or both together)",15801

basically animal crossing with combat and humans.

very chill would recommend.",15801
2023-11-07,"even though i think this is a good game and after some optimizations it will be better. personally i just find this very tedious. as if the task of constantly grinding resources isn't time consuming enough, many of the games mechanics impose more restrictions so everything takes longer and forces you to stop what your doing. this isn't the only sandbox game that does that but i just wish the game would get out of my way and let me build and gather and do quests in the way i choose. the game though runs good and has many characters and a cool setting. i would recommend if you like stardew valley mixed with various features from other sandbox games",15801

2023-11-07,"there are few games i sit with such great anticipation, dropping everything else to play at launch. as a long time portia fan, i made the decision to wait for the full launch of sandrock so i could  really delve into the experience. it was well worth the wait!! 

mechanics that i loved in portia were only improved by sandrock, i applause the mining and archaeology process! i am glad it's so much easier to manage artifacts and the geodes of ore. i also enjoy the addition of the scrap yard contracts for those older ore types you don't always want to get digging for.

the combat addition of the gun is really funny and clever with the western vibe. although simple, the harder bosses do give a dark soul vibe with the roll dodging.

crafting has only gotten better, and i am glad certain quests don't ask for an egregious number of supplies like portia did some times. very reasonable and smooth to escalate types.

characters! wowie! this has gone leaps and bounds from portia (although i will always love them!) each character is so unique! love the full dialogue for romance options, the personalities of all npcs are a hoot! the writing has me laughing so often, you can feel the love with each cutscene no matter the minor character. i find myself actually wanting to befriend each npc in the city, they all have such great personality!

the story has been just as fun as portia, i love the world building of this series. my only complaint is wanting more!! need a prequel surrounding peach or something. the enemies, the subtle build of tension with hints through the newspapers and letters are a great touch. i find myself excited to open the mail!

my only cons so far are:
bugs - very minor though. this game is so much cleaner than portia at launch, a bit of hair bugs or clothing doesn't hurt nobody.
npc pathing - ai is always hard to manage, but lord trying to find some of these people before friend status is a nightmare! 
unfortunate timings - i have had a few funny situations regarding cutscenes, sandstorms and time management. maybe i'm just very efficient, but sometimes the mix and match of time sensitive missions can be a nightmare. shout out to the calendar feature!

all in all, this game is an amazing addition to my much beloved portia. the team knocked it out of the park and it's great to see what a budget can do. i am genuinely excited for any and all extra content they may throw our way, and i hope they celebrate such an awesome launch!",15801

2023-11-06,"as you can probably tell from the playtime, i adore this game. coming in at the 200 hour mark (and possibly a few more) is no mean feat.

my time at sandrock took the formula pathea started in portia and dialed it up to the next level. the game plays roughly the same. you're a brand new builder that arrived at a town that is in decline and it is up to you to turn your talents to improve the lives of those around you.

the gameplay loop is fairly simple. go out into the wilds, gather resources, bring them back to your workshop and get your machines turning out the components necessary to fulfill your commissions, upgrade your capabilities and home, repeat. to do this, you manage stamina as you gather materials and also engage in light, fairly simple combat.

what pathea does well is package this up in a charming setting with an amazing cast of characters. the graphics engine, while simple, is supported by a unique art style that allows for a wide range of colorful residents of sandrock while keeping the system demand to a minimum. my 7800x3d and 7900xtx are utter overkill for this game. that said, don't let the relatively mild requirements fool you - the game is beautiful. the art style is timeless, the town has a unique feel and the landscape vistas are wonderful. i found myself taking in-game photos of things to take advantage of the customizable portrait decorations you can hang in your house and, later, factory.

the engine does have a few hitches. the draw distance is rather poor and there aren't intermediate level of detail models. objects will sort of pop into existence and if you have the lod bias set to anything less than maximum, you'll see the outline of a bubble immediately around you while the supports on your workshop's border fence pop into existence. it also struggles with longer game sessions, so if you play four hours at a time, you'll start to notice pathfinding breaking or weird artifacts like bushes floating up in space out in front of the temple of the light.

all in all though, i find the graphics and engine appealing. there are a few hitches and bugs here, though nothing experience breaking.

what really makes sandrock shine is the world pathea created. running in parallel with the events of portia, sandrock casts you as a builder that arrived in the town of the same name. the town is suffering from severe decline due to decades of resource mismanagement and environmental degradation. water is in short supply and routine sandstorms buffet the town, slowly chewing away what little life is left in the area. had it not been for a rich deposit of old world ruins, the town would have long since died and been left to vanish in the dunes of the euphala desert.

the town is populated with a rich cast of colorful characters with their own distinct personalities. my personal favorites are cooper, a local rancher who has a habit of speaking in lengthy diatribes and has a conspiracy theory streak (i swear cooper's voice actor had more lines than the next five characters combined), and unsuur, a well meaning but not too bright local deputy who loves rocks a bit too much who i liken to a combination of drax from guardians of the galaxy and barnie fife from the andy griffith show.

surprisingly, the plot is actually quite deep. there is more going on than a simple tale of you building up stuff. there is banditry, a conspiracy and more going on that has a surprising climax. sandrock not only has an interesting story, it goes well beyond what a charming life sim should be and fleshes out the broader world of the free cities alliance and the surrounding nations.

my time at sandrock is a solid combination of life sim and narrative experience combined with a light factory inventory management game. if you're looking for a nice change of pace, you can't go wrong here.",16388
2023-11-06,"wow, my time at sandrock is really an amazing game! after i got really disappointed by starfield and cities skylines: 2, i stumbled on my time at sandrock on youtube and also here on steam by some ads ... then i watched a few streams and bought it now!

it is such a nice game and i can't stop playing it! it's a mix of animal crossing and stardew valley and plays extremely well. it's not too childish and the ingame mechanics are very balanced. i am sure i can play this game for far beyond 100 hours! definitely worth the 30 bucks.",16388
2023-11-06,"amazing game, at first you would think nothing special, but i must say i played my time in partia and sandrock is a major improvement, if you dont know what this game is and you think on buying it definetly recomend, for new players the stamina system could be a bad thing, but give the game time, it sucks you in really fast. great story, great world, the game makes you feel like a real part of the town and when you notice how much you build in the world and how much it changes its really rewarding.",16388
2023-11-06,"a really nice relaxing farming game!!

single player may not be the most innovative story, but it is lovingly designed and fits the setting.
multiplayer works and the focus is on building the city, which is also a lot of fun.

i give it a clear purchase recommendation to anyone who likes cozy farming games like stardew valley, harvest moon and yes, animal crossing

so far there's only one point where i still have doubts and that is what is the replacement for the quest with the crane in order to be able to farm tin properly :d but i suspect that the error is more mine than the game :d but i'm open to any advice thankful :)

? ? ?

ein richtig schönes entspannendes farming spiel!! 
 
singleplayer ist vielleicht nicht die innovatievste story aber sie ist liebevoll gestaltet und passt zum setting.
multiplayer funktioniert und dort steht der stadtaufbau erstmal im vordergrund was auch sehr viel spaß macht.

von mir eine klare kaufempfehlung an jeden der auf cozy farming games steht wie stardew valley, harvest moon und ja auch animal crossing

bisher nur einen punkt an dem ich bis jetz noch verweifel und zwar was ist der ersatz für die quest mit dem kran um vernünftig tin farmen zu können :d aber da vermute ich den fehler mehr bei mir als beim spiel :d bin aber für jeden tip dankbar :)",16388
2023-11-06,"it should would be nice to be able to play enough of the game to actually give it a proper review but in my short play time i have had three freezes that required me to restart my entire pc.

one was hung on a black screen after a  cutscene and 2 were the audio distorting and slowing down leading up to freezes. the audio distortion followed by crashes was an issue they claimed to have fixed in the june 7th, 2022 patch notes, but several people complained they still had the issue and it was never mentioned by the devs again.

this is the second time pathea has released a game that i literally cannot play because of all the constant crashing even out of early access.",16388

2023-11-02,"absolute lovely game. enjoyable story, plenty of jokes to go along with it. and engaging gathering /building and farming system. npc are quite fleshed out with their own stories personalities and motivations. 
those that enjoy a balance between slice of life and adventure story need look no further than to give sandrock  a try.",7446
2023-11-06,"unpopular opinion but i wasn't a fan of my time at portia and found it kind of overrated, so i was very surprised when my time at sandrock ended up being one of my favourite games of all time. i've played a lot of life sim style games and this is one of the best by far - it's the only one i've played to rival my love of rune factory 4 in terms of gameplay, story and character dialogue.

i have 110+ hours in the game (started a bit before the 1.0 release) and i'm not even finished the main story quests yet, i thought i was almost done a while back and it turned out i was only 2/3 of the way through. there are always meaningful story events happening and new characters being introduced to keep things interesting. 

there are a lot of activities to do each day to stop things getting too monotonous - a mix of exploration, dungeon crawling, mining or hanging around town. you can also fish and farm, which i'm not too fond of doing in this game but are totally optional outside of a couple of quests. 

the characters are where this game stands out - the localization team did a great job with the dialogue because it's full of personality and can be pretty hilarious at times. the town is very lively with the characters all having different relationships to each other and having a lot of joint quests and scenes so it feels like a real community. one downside is the day to day dialogue lines can get kind of repetitive but there are a lot of character related events which is where the bulk of the content is. their faces are also not that expressive in dialogue which would be my main complaint, but the voice acting is very expressive and fills that gap. 

there are some bugs at the moment but the devs seem very active and engaged with the community. aside from the bugs the game feels very polished, and i'm honestly blown away at the sheer scale of it for a relatively small company. there is so much content, from the very long main story, to the numerous character quests, to the new locations, mines and dungeons to unlock. and unlike portia each mine/ruin feels unique and has distinct level design features to keep things interesting. honestly huge props to the devs for what they've achieved here, you can tell a lot of love was put into the game and they genuinely had fun with the world and characters they created (speaking of the world, the worldbuilding is pretty in depth and the setting is very interesting - i did love the concept of my time at portia despite my criticisms of the game, and that interesting history continues to be explored here).",16388
2023-11-06,:),16388
2023-11-06,"let me preface this by saying that i played my time at portia and didn't enjoy it at all. my time at sandrock absolutely blows it out of the water, and addresses my two most standout grievances about the first.

this time, they have designed the map properly so that your character never spends too long traversing from one location to another. the town map/level is beautifully made so that your workshop is never too far from any npcs you might need to reach/chat with daily. secondly, this is the most fun i've had with a towns' npc population in a while. a lot of cozy game developers forget to develop their characters beyond the basic, typical strokes. at first i felt like this would be the case for sandrock too, but i found myself genuinely enjoying a lot of the town's npc personalities that shine through their questlines. the writing isn't nearly the best i've seen in a game, but it's definitely a step above most cozy games i've played recently. at least more fun, if anything!

if i had to pick at any obvious downsides, i'd say that some voice actors are clearly uncomfortable in their characters' accents and inflections and it shows. i don't mind it too much but it might be grating to some.

as of the time of writing, i'm 40 hours in and i'm still being engaged with the game, so it earns my seal of approval.",16388
2023-11-06,"man, i'd love to be able to play enough of this game to give it a genuine review, but i can't play for more than a minute at a time because of the crashes. this game is so needlessly demanding graphically that it somehow corrupted my graphics card drivers twice! for now, don't pay over 30 bucks for a crash simulator.",16388
2023-11-06,"beautiful and cute, fun gathering and building game with some combat elements as well. well worth a look.",16388
2023-11-06,"really solid multiplayer. makes the single player feel terrible. 

my only complaint about the multiplayer is, you have one character and you lose all material belongings upon leaving a town to join a new one. would love to see this let us play multiple characters tbh but i doubt it'll happen.",16388
2023-11-06,"i usually like the more laid-back farming games but being a builder is fun! i love the characters and the story line so far. i am only 23 hours into the game, i am not sure about end-game content yet. i haven't even met all the characters yet. i hope it's a long on ongoing game. i got this while i was waiting for coral island release and i wasn't expecting to love it as much as i do! highly recommend!",16388

2023-11-05,"spent 4 hilarious hours in ""my time at sandrock"" wrestling with a crane lift assembly that was more confusing than a rubik's cube in the dark. tried to refund on steam, but they enforced their 2-hour refund rule like it was a fortress. my time investment was worth a laugh, though!",19735
2023-11-05,"nice game, would be better if the dev console wasn't rendered inaccessible upon full launch. don't get me wrong, pathea makes grinding fun more than a chore, but when your whole game revolves around grinding, god, you've got to let people choose to use console commands. i completely would get if the devs locked the console only for multiplayer, but why a total hard lock. once i complete the story and missions, sandrock will feel like a massive chore if i have to continue grinding just to do the things i actually want to be doing. 

tldr: sandrock now feels like a sandbox game without the sandbox mode. like playing in a sandbox without sand or attempting to swim in a pool without water. i can't recommend sandrock once more unless dev console is returned.


aside from that discrepancy, have some bullet points.

positive:

1.) very pretty game world, the town of sandrock and her people feel rich and enticing. although, diversity is what makes the world appealing, but that mostly ends if you stray any significant distance away from town or your workshop.

2.)romance feature in sandrock gets more ""worth it"" points compared to portia. i romanced unsuur, and his character arc was adorable and had me go from finding him irrelevant to him seeming like a wholesome, goofy character who i can strongly relate to. i cry when i see him in a sad or embarrassing sitch.

3.) house building. coming from a lifelong sims fanatic, sandrock's home building feature draws me in despite it having a sort of learning curve. i'm very dependent on mouse/keyboard when in building games, so its of note that sandrock's house builder catches my attention at all.

negative:

1.) despite its pastel-toned cartoonish vibe, sandrock can feel too immersive. grinding never gets genuinely less dreadful. machines require both water and fuel to operate, adding an extra thing to worry about despite adding nothing of value to the game. requiring fuel makes sense in a game like this, it serves as a subtle tactic to get the player to be actively involved in their workshop. requiring water as well looks good in terms of world design, but serves no purpose otherwise that fuel requirement wasn't already achieving.

2.) sandrock feels like a rich, vibrant world. sandrock also feels just as empty as it does to visit earth in starfield.  aside from story purposes, i felt no eagerness to explore new map areas. i rarely leave the confines of my workshop or the town itself. when i bought sandrock, the idea of it taking place in a desert allured me, it rendered in me that eager feeling to see what's out there. but after seeing what's ""out there"", i'm left feeling dissapointed that there wasn't more. no personality or variation in new map spaces. generally, ""all's the same"".",19735
2023-11-05,"if you liked mtap, this is more of the same, but better polished and more fun moment to moment. very good, verging on great.

some minor annoyances. pace of ramp-up can be egregiously slow in the early game. tutorials are kind of intrusive. some of the prominent voice actors are, how to put it, like a pickhammer to the side of the skull.

but despite those annoyances, generally excellent.",19735

early into the game you get flirty letters from a homosexual man. you catch him once you figure out he's been putting them in your mailbox. you're quested to go and convince him to come out of the closet. i'm grateful i was distracted from the enjoyment of the video game to be reminded that gay people exist and have feelings too.

i have decided to uninstall this game and put it in the bin next to fortnite and starfield.",19735
2023-11-05,"mixed review while i do enjoy it has the same problems i had with portia. the pacing is really slow and the map tho big it feels extremely empty, there’s a lot of walking back and forth with nothing around, easy fix would be to make the town buildings smaller and closer together. there’s no need for the amount of space and scale, it is a town in the middle of nowhere with limited water after all.",19735
2023-11-05,"the first sequel in years to not disappoint me.

better than portia in every way, and i'm having a lot of fun.
- much higher production quality, as is apparent from cutscenes, voice acting, artwork, character designs, quests, writing, etc.
- many much appreciated qol improvements, such as being able to pet multiple farm animals at once.
- combat has been markedly improved (thank god), but still nothing to write home about.
- production loop has been vastly improved. no longer will your machines run 24/7 producing bronze plates. commissions and constructions ask for varied items in reasonably quantities.
- home customization has been introduced, letting you create whatever size and layout you like.

critiques:
- character customization is very basic, unfortunately.
- fishing! fish variety has been vastly trimmed down, and you're no longer incentivized to catch one of every fish; the fish tank is gone.
- many tooltips are holdovers from beta and therefore now inaccurate.
- 60 hours in and i have had 2 bugs that forced me to restart the client.
- inconsistencies in certain cutscenes.
- distinct lack of diversity in romanceable women. for men there's skinny dudes, chunky dudes, big dudes, older dudes, fem dudes, but for women there's only skinny young lady. some big girls or older ladies would have been nice.",19735
2023-11-05,"decent game, but not ready for full release. i would recommend it once the issues are fixed.
two most annoying issues:
1. loading performance is terrible - loading a save or entering ruins takes minutes!
2. machines become dusted, but no actual dust is visible and there's no way to clean them - it's a known issue, and still has not been fixed (there's a workaround, but that's not good enough - fix your game!)",19735
2023-11-05,"i absolutely love this game. previously my favourite farming game was portia, now it's sandrock. it's such an amazing game that its existence makes me happy.
let me explain: i play a lot of farming games and i love the genre. many of them share a number of common flaws however, such as shallow characters, weak non-farming mechanics, quest design that feels like chore. not in sandrock (or portia, for that matter)! the characters interact with each other in believable and lively ways. it's no longer that the player is the only thing that exists to them. everyone comes together to build a town and the player is only one small part of it. this makes the quests so much more believable.
what really impressed me was the way it differs from/improves upon portia. portia did a lot of things very well, but sandrock didn't just take those mechanics unchanged. instead, sandrock improved upon every little thing in portia that bothered me (e.g. the guns were a bit weak in portia; they're totally viable in sandrock) and also refreshed other aspects (e.g. i liked the fishing mini game in portia; sandrock changed the mini game but it's equally entertaining) so that series fans like me aren't bored.
the way the multiplayer is implemented is also quite good.
overall, i just love the thought and care the devs have put in this game. it's incredibly rare nowadays to see a game in a popular genre where the devs didn't settle for easy formulas and past success, but continue to improve. love everything about this game!",19735
2023-11-05,"this game is very cute and well made! it looks beautiful, has great building mechanics, farming/raising livestock, and fighting monsters! the npcs are all really well-made with distinct personalities. the variety in people in town/that you can romance is great! the clothing/accessories on your character look nice and have good movement physics. overall, the game is a solid 8/10 for me right now! and that's at 13 hours in. i'm sure i'll grow to love the game more as i play even more.",19735

2023-11-05,"i love this game, its chill, its non-punishing, its stress free, its just a really charming and sweet game. i liked portia as well, but never spent nearly the amount of hours i did in this game. i still haven't even finished the story. 

the devs really did a wonderful job improving upon the previous game's mechanics, making a lot of qol improvements that just make the game that much more relaxing and enjoyable. the art is clean and adorable, and the characters are very well done, just like they were in the previous game. i can't stop myself from coming back to these lovable idiots, and i mean that in the most endearing way possible. :d

if you like life sim games, this game has a bit of everything, some farming mechanics, a very basic fishing system that's not your traditional fishing minigame, but its easy and doesn't feel burdensome or required. i love the transmog system the devs have added to allow outfit customization of the character, so you don't have to worry about stats over looks.

2023-11-05,"i picked up my time at sandrock as soon as it was available in early access. i enjoyed my time at portia and was excited to jump into this and be along for the development ride. if you enjoyed portia and haven't picked this up yet, i'd highly suggest you do so, you won't be disappointed.

i'm not much of a reviewer so he's my highlights.

good

-the visuals-the visual presentation is great. the style they started with in portia was kept for sandrock and tightened, cleaned, and it really pops. a straight improvement from its predecessor.

-characters-the characters fit with the world that these games take place in. goofballs on the one hand but can be serious on the other. it does a good job of portraying a tight knit group that has history with each other and rely on each other. the vas do a good job and you never really feel like its being phoned in.

-story-so, you've played some harvest moon games, stardew valley, and similar games...whelp, you know what kind of story you're getting into. that's not a bad thing though, we love those stories and that's why we scoop games like these up because while every story in these style of games has a similar foundation what's built on top of it gives us an insight into the biggest character in these games, the town. the town is a character all its own, a combination of its past, present, environment, and the characters living in, around, or otherwise interacting with it throughout the story. it takes on a life of its own and sandrock, as a town/character, is fun to see develop.

-qol-there were so many improvements to make life much easier in sandrock, it would almost make portia a little harder to go back to. but i very much appreciate everything they implemented in sandrock to make a builders life easier when it comes to making your shop hum along and get those contracts done. something a portia player can appreciate more than a newbie but a thumbs up from me.

bad

let me preface this by saying i'm not a tech savvy man, what you know about the power of rigs and all of the bells and whistles is probably beyond me so take this short section of bad with a grain of salt, your results may vary.

when i'd start up the game, while my load times were rather quick when i'd get into the game it could take a solid minute, at max, for the world to load everything. if i got into the game and i was loading in while in the house, that was fine but once i left the house or would load into a game that had me outside there could be a bit of a wait for things to load. i never found it a terrible thing but a rig that's a little on the lower end might have more of an issue.

the other thing i noticed is that if i played for a block of 3-4 hours in a row i could start to experience slowdown that became much more significant as the time would go on and control inputs would also be laggy. a couple times character path-finding became erratic and would be my prompt to log off. i haven't done blocks like that in a while and so i don't know if it's a concern and it may have just been my machine but i did experience that.",19735
2023-11-05,"as massive fan of portia, bought this one first day of ea and played it from time to time at various states of it's beta.
at ea launch game had terrible loading time and optimisation issues and since then devs went miles to improve it, up to the point it works smoothly like portia while being massively above it terms of graphics and stuff.

compared with mtap the game feels better in every possible direction, devs listened to their playerbase and adapted the game as much as possible and so far it's one of the best ""life sim"" games on market, easily equal to legendary stardew valley itself.

if you liked the first game - rest assured, it's ""the same but better"". much better.
so better that paying full price feels not enough assuming the amount of effort and love devs put into this game.
heavily recommending to any fan of the genre. good stuff.",19735
2023-11-05,"i purchased the game a few days before the official release, from an online recommendation, and i can honesty say that this is the best farm sim i've ever played. it improves on so many quality of life issues that i've experienced with other farming sims. being able to alter how quickly the time of day passes by and also having villagers that actually have depth to their characterization, voice acting and updated dialog that matches the game's story progression, it's a breath of fresh air. i love that villagers actually react to weather conditions, change their form of dress to suit the weather, and don't just stand outside like robots as if it were a regular sunny day. love the freedom and flexibility provided by designing your character's house and farmland. i also love the diversity in the cast of characters, they don't all look like they have the exact same cookie cutter anime body shape. 

also, being able to talk to npcs while still mounted on your horse, was a feature i was relived to see in this game. i cannot tell you how annoying it was playing games like harvest moon and having to get off your mount just to talk to someone, then jump back on your mount every single time. being able to access all storage boxes from a single storage unit, being able to complete fetch quest assignments with items that you're not carrying with you at the time, but are still in your storge inventory is also a wonderful addition. the animals in the game, whether they be farm animals or wild animals that you fight for exp have their own unique charm to them. love the fact that you can upgrade your horse and take photos with it. and the horse gallop and leaping animations are wonderful. 

i currently play this game on the steam deck and it's been a great experience. camera felt a little wonky at first, had to set the x and y camera sensitivity to 15 and the aim sensitivity to 40 for it to feel better on steam deck, so not sure if the defaults camera setting was set up for keyboard. other than a few floating foliage plants in the air, and utensils not appearing in an npc's hand while eating, the game has ran near prefectly on my steam deck. 

cannot wait for any future dlc planned by this dev. would love to see possibly mounted combat, or updated pets, enemy monsters, townsfolk, or farm animals. or having a game in the future where you can choose to be an antagonist or protagonist would be a welcome to see. my only complaint would be during character customization, i wish the character could have more body shape options then just looking like a stick. when you're a woman, it's a little frustrating not being able to give your character a figure or hips. but other than that, i have no other complaints about the game. i truly hope other developers can see the success of this franchise and use it as an example to improve theirs as well. like iron sharpening iron.",19735
2023-11-04,"took everything i loved about my time at portia and just made everything better, all of the characters in this story are so much fun and i love them all. i find myself thinking about the little quotes at work and how much i just want to come back to this game! love this game with all my heart! cowboy hot.",16806
2023-11-04,"great follow up to my time at portia.  i was skeptical at the beginning with the recycling mechanisms at the beginning and the scarcity of some resources, but the game is a blast and definitely captures the same feeling as portia.",16806

worth it really. its the rpg every one wanted",16806
2023-11-04,"as a player that played my time at portia before , sandrock really do improve in terms of content and quality of life . for new players that had not touch portia before , sandrock might be overwhelming for the amount of things it threw at you first . however once u get used to it , thats where the fun in sandrock starts .though , most of us probably would be cursing whenever a certain weather arrives especially if we had things we wanna do on that day ...ahh my items got blown away!!! come backkkkk!!!!!",16806
2023-11-04,enjoyed my time portia this next installment is in improvement in every category combat still meh but its better va is good character design is good runs smooth not bugs or crashes 14 hrs in i recommend,16806

2023-11-04,"i loved sandrock during early access and didn't have any problems. now in since launch i am getting bsod and the game crashes my entire system after playing (sometimes as quickly as 10min after launch). i did email their q/a and i am hoping that they'll get these addressed, but for now i'd avoid buying until these major crashes get fixed (yes, this is post ""crashfix"" yesterday).",16806
2023-11-04,"nintendo should take notes, this game is absolutely amazing. if you have been searching for a building game for years and have yet to find a good one to scratch that itch, you have found the right game. i promise you won't be disappointed. use your 2 hour window to test the game and if you don't like it just refund it, but i can guarantee you won't want to refund it because it is amazing!",16806
2023-11-04,"another fantastic game! i adored my time at portia, and i'm loving sandrock so far too. the similarities are nice to see but still brings enough differences to make it unique! the character art is adorable and i love the variety.  there's so much more for me to explore and i can't wait to play more.",16806
2023-11-04,i love the release ! i love all the new updates! i have spent over 700 hours on it so far and would recommend this game to anyone who asks about it.. in fact i have to several people who also ended up picking up the game and also loved it! i love everything about it. i am a fan of the series !,16806
2023-11-04,i had to put my bg3 play through on pause because i can't put this down 10/10,16806
2023-11-04,"this game has been honestly really enjoyable overall. i played it on the early access at first and then put the game down until release and i'm impressed by the amount of content it has now compared to when i first tried it out. i really enjoy all the building, crafting, gathering etc. 

the game makes me feel like i'm always in a race against time, on the clock tick tock gotta go fast, but after a while i realized it really dsnt matter if you just chill out and take your time. missing some of the daily missions is perfectly fine and just exploring at your own pace is not a problem at all. of course, the nature of the daily cycle mixed with the daily contracts adds this feeling of being in a rush to do everything you can do within a single day. 

the combat and gearing is very simple but its still a part of the game i did enjoy. don't expect like difficult combat, but its still satisfying to see my damage grow as i get levels and upgrade my gear to purple + highest item level in the machines.

i hit max character level and max level workshop in multiplayer and i still have places to explore, missions to complete and new things to craft/build.",16806
2023-11-04,absolutely fun..! it feels like home :),16806
2023-11-04,"good, wholesome fun that captures the feeling and community of small-town living. i also like the main plot and western/frontier theme.

better than stardew valley",16806
2023-11-04,"something funidemental with the game broke with 1.0 causeing serious issues for many of us 
my main issues are loading times when doing anythign from starting a cut scene to even opening the menu 
as well as issues with images loading takeing long enough it seems like ppl and things are just poping out of no were . i loved portia and did rlly enjoy this game when it first came out but sadly i just cant recomend a game that has these serious issues to anybody. heres hopeing the devs can figure it out soon so i can change this reveiw to something along the lines of quit thinking and buy the game",16806

let us share items across more than a single chest.
great game otherwise.
",16806
2023-11-04,i like it,16806
2023-11-04,"a marked improvement over its predecessor in many points. it feels much more polished and got rid of a lot of the jank that still made portia feel like a bit of a prototype.
the setting is more interesting as well. the town of sandrock is pretty much dying in the beginning of the game, and getting it back to the right path, even bringing back a bit of green to the desert in later stages, feels pretty satisfying.",16806
2023-11-04,"loved my time at portia , but damn i waited till this was fully released and its still just killing my pc while any game i can play at full graphics , this is on low and still shit , i wouldnt get it the now until its fixed",16806
2023-11-04,"fun game, as expected.  if you played my time in portia, you'll like this.  a little to get started compared to portia, found that once i got bronze tools the game picked up speed/enjoyment.",16806
2023-11-04,i have 300+ hours in this game and still going strong. game has been done justice by the devs <3,16806
2023-11-04,"due to their recent disgusting attitude towards gog players (announcing the game on gog, distributing streamer keys, and now pulling back from gog), they have lost me as a customer.

they also added sniffers to the game due to the multiplayer. dead company for me.",16806
2023-11-04,its a fun game for those who enjoy resource management and crafting.,16806
2023-11-04,"this game has crafting, exploring, fishing, farming, and a fulfilling cozy plot in spite of the desert aesthetics. the game developers have been very responsive to feedback and quick to send out patches throughout the entire process. i've started a new game with the 1.0 release and am enjoying seeing the game play out how it is meant to be.",16806

2023-11-04,if you enjoyed portia it's more of the same. considering portia already took a ton of hours and this one is even bigger i'm not sure yet if that is a good thing or not. so far it's a pretty addictive formula; you're constantly trying to squeeze in as much as you can in each day which keeps you engaged. i'll try and update this review when i'm closer to finishing/finished.,16806
2023-11-04,"positive:
very engaging story and event plus with fully voice acted character too.most life don't even have voice acted character.this game show to passion developer to create great life simulation game.this game is improvement from portia in every way possible.

negative:
outside story nothing much to do at endgame since pretty much max the commission already
no more interaction between characters and player when you max out and do all their quest (beside they asking to date\play)
character like ernest / amirah /owen have almost no interaction at all with player

9/10 best life sim i played since sims 3",16806
2023-11-04,"this is a neutral review. i don't think the game is for me, but i think fans of the genre will probably like it. it's well made from a technical standpoint. there is a lot to collect and do, it just isn't very compelling. the screenshot/videos are very accurate to what the game is. if you think you'll like it, you probably will, if you're hoping for something greater than the sum of its parts, you might be disappointed.",16806
2023-11-04,nice time killer,16806
2023-11-04,"multiplayer's fun when you have mates to play with. single player is single player nothing much i can describe. if you're up for achievements, it only procs on single player not multiplayer. (just a heads up before buying or grinding)

2023-11-04,"my time at sandrock is a 5-star gem.
 it immerses you in the desert community of sandrock as a builder, tasked with saving the town from financial catastrophe. the game offers deep game-play, customization, and breathtaking graphics. engaging characters, soothing atmosphere, and responsive developers make it a must-play!",16806

2023-11-04,"great improvements compared to portia. 
tips to get started: 
get wood scraps whenever you see them (chests!), 
get some water improvements from tech tree, 
everyday eat twice at the saloon (start with discounted meals).",16806
2023-11-04,"came into sandrock as a big my time at portia aficionado and as many have said, fans of the latter will find a lot to love in this title.

mtas has brought [i] huge [/i] improvements in the quality-of-life department, along with gorgeous visuals and a new multiplayer mode to boot. recent updates have really fleshed out npc stories and brought the depth of character i loved in mtap, and it's been wonderful to watch this game come to life over the course of its early access period.

for newcomers: the ""my time"" series stands out to me as a life sim that has it all, from crafting and farming to romance and combat, with robust systems that make it all enjoyable to play - and my time at sandrock is no different. 

i'm creeping up on 500 in-game hours... if that says anything!",16806

2023-11-03,"my time at portia was already a great game with a lot of interesting and fun ideas, but this new game, just got most of the (many) clunky bits from the original title, applied a shiny new coat of beautiful paint over them, fixed most of the issues, added a ton of qol improvements and focused on being a fleshed fun experience with hours upon hours of content. and even then, they also managed to slap multiplayer and coop mode, too!

for the price, this is truly a gem that will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours. this is now the equivalent of stardew valley on 3d, with its own ideas and style.

just a fun, campy and wholesome experience that delivers what it promises.

if you liked portia, or any other similar game, you will surely enjoy your time in sandrock!

more games like this, please!",11835

5 hearts!",11835
2023-11-04,"basically portia in the desert.  it looks better and there's a lot more polish, and more importantly there's a number of qol improvements.  things like the game automatically taking things from your storage containers, sprint toggle, fast travel points being there from the start, etc.  the perk tree is also far more useful this time around.  the characters seem a little more interesting this time as well.  i still like the core gameplay concept more than most farming sims, as your money comes from doing commissions rather than just mass producing whatever is valuable and throwing it into a box.

that said there's still some issues from the first game, the biggest being the mobile game timers on all the crafting.  i sure do enjoy having to wait 10+ minutes of real life time to smelt some bars, and then another 5-10 minutes to turn those into whatever other parts your need.  you just kind of have to make 4-5 of each production machine, but then of course that means more resource gathering to fuel them.  just like the first game, a mod to make crafting faster would cut the game length in half.  the combat also hasn't improved at all.  you still just mash attack and do a dodge roll every so often, and that's it.  there's an armour break system now, but it gets trivialised once you find the '+1 break' skill on the perk tree and murder everything in seconds.

if you need a busywork sim game to fill your time, this is still a decent improvement on the first one.  there's lots and lots of stuff to do, it's a chill game genre,  and it's entertaining enough to overlook most of the flaws.",16806

the landscape of sandrock is a visual treat, with its desolate beauty and a sense of exploration that kept me engaged for hours on end. the attention to detail in the environment and the variety of biomes made every journey exciting, whether i was traversing the  wastelands or navigating the mysterious ruins.

the crafting system is where sandrock truly shines. with a wide array of resources to gather and a plethora of blueprints to discover, i was constantly motivated to experiment and create new items, from weapons and tools to cozy furnishings for my humble abode. the feeling of progress as i upgraded my workshop and expanded my capabilities was incredibly rewarding.

the interactions with the colorful cast of characters in sandrock added depth to the story and provided a sense of community in an otherwise harsh world. building relationships with the townsfolk was an enjoyable aspect of the game, and their unique personalities and quests brought the game world to life.

while my time at sandrock was largely enjoyable, there were occasional technical hiccups and performance issues that could be frustrating. however, the frequent updates from the developers gave me hope that these issues would be resolved over time.

in conclusion, my 150 hours at sandrock have been a delightful adventure. the combination of exploration, crafting, and storytelling in this unique post-apocalyptic world made it a memorable gaming experience, and i look forward to further updates and improvements as i continue to explore and build in this engaging sandbox world.",11835
2023-11-03,this game is well done and very addicting especially once you find your rhythm of crafting and gathering. probably the best feature of the game is how they handle inventory and storage. you can craft at any worktable/machine from items that are in any chests and you can turn in quests anywhere on the map with items that are in your chests at home. you can also push a button to store and sort items from your inventory into matching items that are in any of your chests. this is the best qol feature of the game imo since inventory management in other games is a pain so i'm glad sandrock is doing it right.,11835
2023-11-03,"my time at optimizing is a cutesy, cozy, post apocalyptic life sim.

enjoy characters that make you think you might be a bully on the inside and dialouge written by 2 guys that went to the same comedy course together. voice acted characters that will make you feel like the only real person in a universe full of robots are here too to spruce up your free time and welcome you to your shack far outside of city bounds because no way in hell are they sharing space with your filthy ass.

there are many things to do! spend your time recycling wood, recycling stone, recycling metal and even recycling rubber. ask other inhabitants of sandrock to join you in any of the over 1 activities on offer. become a neet strategist as you attempt to figure out how half the seasonal event work. give up and recycle wood again! exciting!!!

now if you'll excuse me i have to pay out of pocket for a new water tower less we all die of dehydration within the next week and the church zealots that rule this town do not hand out credit even for life threatening disasters that affect all of us. don't you dare ever ask for anything for any goverment contracts.

enjoy. 8/10 (i really do like it. i'm dating the divorced single mom it makes up for everything.)",11835
2023-11-03,so far the overall game is great. just as you start to get bored doing basically the same thing over and over there's something new that happens. bringing you back into the game. i do wish there were more choice and romance interactions (times that the hearts come up in conversations). but other than that it's a great game. it's right up there with stardew valley for me so thank you.,11835
2023-11-03,"this game is something else. so comfy and relaxing to play, but delivers great story, which often isn't a thing for this type of relaxing games. plot twists are very well written and genuinely surprising, i really envy people who are going to experience them for the first time. romance stuff is, in most part, also very good. there are some shortcoming with few of the characters, but i believe it can be improved and more content can be added.
overall, i played it for 750 hours and i can't wait to play for twice, thrice and even more",11835
2023-11-03,"they took everything about portia and turned it up to 11.

a wide variety of people in town. so many personalities. they play off of each other to make it feel like it's a real interaction. there are disagreements where both sides aren't wrong. there are little things that drive the characters forward. intrigue. a history!

yes, i'm a bit biased. i've been playing the early access game for a long time. watching this grow from a concept to an actual fully fleshed out game has been a lot of fun. playing it is even more so. :)",11835
2023-11-03,"i  played my time at portia and really enjoyed it and got sandrock early access. don't be fooled by the ridiculous day 1 cosmetic dlc packs the game itself is actually decent. can't say anything about multiplayer since i don't have any friends. only problem is pretty much universal with every game of this genre: a lot of dialogue can, should and was not trimmed off.",11835
2023-11-03,"imagine a kickstarted, crowdfunded ea-game that promised full online co-op campaign via description, steam-tags and all sorts of initial suggerence only to knowingly double-down after the fact with the main excuse of ""oh mp kinda hard/difficult and we 'forgot' to technically design/implement around mp as a foundation of the game... but thx for your money! kthxbye :) o/""

do not buy this game if you expect full co-op story campaign from it's ""online co-op"" in steam tags. i'd also strongly recommend against buying this game if you oppose to false advertising and intentional/malevolent business practices.

you can't seriously expect anyone to believe gamedevs/publishers who clearly are able to create and publish a full-fledged aaa-game... to having ""misunderstood"" or ""forgotten"" the technical and meta-linguistic requirements and meaning of full... online... co-op, multiplayer campaign.

buy the game after the fact/release if you're a gullible clown that enjoys being scammed, and sitting in some moronic, watered-down ""mp co-op mode"" that mainly stands as a testament for devs+publisher to have an ""excuse"" or marginal ""validity"" for their initial false advertisement and to keep their lovely, little ""online co-op"" tag on steam.

another excuse they came up with were ""linguistic"" or ""cultural"" difficulties and ""misunderstandings"". like who are you going to fool. it's not that ""full mp co-op story campaign"" is a completely new genre or ""term"". not much to see here: just a bunch 'o negative, scumming business-clowns that cannot experience love or empathy.",11835
2023-11-02,good cozy game until the kangaroos punch your nose in,7446
2023-11-02,this is the best game ever most games these days are kill   kill  but this one has you do a lot of stuff planting and building doing things for other people there is some killing but its will rounded  again the best ever,7446
2023-11-03,"185 hours. this was the total hours i played on this game while it was still on early access and now that my time at sandrock is officially released this will easily double. i play a ton of farming/building/life sims but never quite as much as i have for this one (barring animal crossing which i feel is in a sub genre of it's own when it comes to sim games because of its real life time shenanigans).

the gameplay loop is addictive and will definitely give you that ""just one more day"" feeling in games like this one. if you ever played my time at portia (which i also have over 100 hours on) then let me just say that this one is better in every single aspect. the environment is much different than the storybook style that portia has. you live in a harsh dessert and very much feels like starved for important resources like water (water is very important in this game) but i feel like seeing it transform with your help as the new ""builder"" makes it feel all the more rewarding. 

the npcs feel very engaging and alive and react based on interactions you have with them (i had one npc propose to start dating that i had to turn down and even though they seem to have taken the rejection well, you can still feel the heartbreak in the rejection with the ensuing dialogue you get from them when you try to talk to them again the following days). and yes! reverse proposals are a thing!

the storyline is probably one of the best ones i have seen in all the games i played in this genre. it pushes you to keep getting the resources and fulfilling the requests as soon as you can to see what happens next.

now though there is a bit of farming, the main focus of the game is more on building the town and creating the things needed for said town building. from stage displays, mining lifts, ""bus stops"" to even having to plant flowers and crafting benches to beautify the town-these are responsibilities that fall on you as the builder.

there are so many other great things to be said about my time at sandrock but i will say as someone who has stardew valley near and dear to my heart (i have 100% that game on my switch like twice already), that this is probably the only game so far that can rival the kind of enjoyment and satisfaction that stardew gives. honestly, even more so.",11835
2023-11-03,"the story is so so fun, you connect with the characters throughout and the commissions give a huge opportunity to develop relations. the combat system is fun and easy, i really love looking at the moves and how they flow. its grindy but not annoying grindy. i am highly addicted to this game... :,d",11835

2023-11-03,it's so addicting!,11835
2023-11-03,i ate a sand rock,11835
2023-11-03,"my time at sandrock is a life simulator game about being an combat engineer-farmer in a post-apocalyptic arid desert setting where water is a scarcity. if you've played the previous game in the series, my time at sandrock is superior in every single way except perhaps the price tag and in the rare category of ""games with quality and originality from a chinese developer"".

unlike the previous game in the series, the game has little focus on time limits and is generally a laid-back experience focused a little more on storytelling than on repetitive routine actions. you build devices, conduct repairs, decorate your home, ingratiate yourself to other townsfolk - it's tempting to compare it to stardew valley, however i find this somewhat inaccurate because stardew valley has little in the way of interesting writing, characterisation, nor a plotline to keep me engaged in it as it relies heavily on a modding community for such content.

this writing and characterisation successfully caters to both children and adults - characters aren't particularly complex in personality, however, the dialogue has an abundance of dry wit, sarcasm and humour to lampoon the moral lessons it's trying to impart; this cushions the irritation that adults may experience when being preached to about what they would consider as obvious lessons in responsibility such as ""don't waste water"", ""don't monopolise resources"", ""don't behave like a psychopath"".

nowhere is this more apparent than in quests where saturday-morning-cartoon npcs blithely remark on and lampshade their anti-social behaviour before you deal with them in a series of increasingly surreal methods. this makes the game worth playing for the comedic nonsensical and satirical value alone. 

the cast of characters to interact with is amazingly diverse, and not in an annoyingly forced and hackneyed way, but in personality too. many of them have humourous character flaws, such as the sheriff's remarkably feckless and cavalier attitude toward due process; or his devoted understudy, who rather uniquely portrays autism in an endearing and positive light. i did not once feel that the game was overtly trying to advance a political nor social agenda on the player, which is often the case with other offerings in this genre.

it was a very wise decision to adopt this writing style as the story may have come off heavy-handed and sententious/preachy otherwise. this character building is absolutely unmatched by any other life simulator game i have ever played. the game even gives you the freedom to be as antisocial, spiteful and negative as you want, although this will obviously alienate yourself from the town community.

if you're looking to wind down from an exhausting day, i can think of few better games to play. if you're looking for a challenging and stressful skill-based game however, you may want to look elsewhere. my biggest regret is that i've finished most of it and that i'm going to have to wait a few more years for a sequel in order to see where the world's storyline is going next.",11835
2023-11-03,it's an improvement in every way over the first game.,11835
2023-11-03,"love love love  this game. definitely my favourite game! performance can be a little bit off sometimes, but the story and world building more than make up for it for me! some very appreciated quality of life improvements over the previous game in the series. highly recommend this game if you like other farming/life sims",11835

2023-11-03,real nice.,11835
2023-11-03,"the my time game series is surely improving throughout the games that they've released. portia was amazingly beautiful but sandrock gave an incredible gameplay experience. first off, the npcs are gorgeous physically and personality wise. the story line is incredible, i mean i've been expecting duvos invasion but not like what i've experience in sandrock. the plot twist was quite unpredictable because i've been eyeing 1 character and it turned out that he/she was just a puppet lol and the mastermind is a different npc all along. and logan ughh, logan. i don't think i need to elaborate that further. i am hoping for an expansion pass since there are certain areas of the map that are present but not currently explorable. 

p.s. automatically bought your dlc because the new pet is cute and the new outfit is cute as well. i hope you can add npc outfit dlcs just like in portia coz i'd like to see logan in a different perspective *wink wink.",11835
2023-11-03,i adore this game so far! a wonderful sequel to portia and i just can't put it down.,11835
2023-11-03,the game so i enjoyed i would recommended for others and the only con is the dlc be separated to purchase and have the gecko as an actual pet,11835
2023-11-03,"if you liked my time at portia or even found it flawed with potential, sandrock improves on it in pretty much every way. if you like life sims/crafting games, you may like this. you get an unbelievable amount of content and customization and replayability for your money. it's not flawless, but i really like what's there a whole lot.

you do not need to have played my time at portia to play sandrock is stands alone.

plays well with either mouse and keyboard or controller (i used controller)

the community you live and work in will dynamically change over the course of the story, people will come and go from town, and everyone has something to say about major story beats.",11835
2023-11-03,"love this game, love the story line!",11835
2023-11-03,"my time at portia never really clicked with me (i played it for 100+ hours, still enjoyed it). my time at sandrock has that special touch to it! immediately was hooked by this game, and excited to play it for many many hours :) 

if you liked my time at portia at all, you'll love this.",11835
2023-11-03,"okay, but how does the oasis stay clean during and after a sandstorm?????????
the church has learned barrier magic, obviously.",11835
2023-11-03,"good game, was already really polished with minimal bugs during early access. just missing story and content that was added at full release today.

big improvements from portia if you've played the previous game from pathea, good quality of life changes, better graphics, more story, content and lore.",11835
2023-11-03,i love this game been playing since ea and i can't wait to finally play the full story. when i first started playing i didn't think i would love it as much as i do. some of the game mechanics were different so for me there was little bit of an adjustment from portia. i loved my time at portia and i have had multiple replays on pc and ps5 and this game is definitely looking like it will be the same way. this series is definitely 10/10. so if you haven't played it you definitely need to be. my only thing i don't love is that when building your house/workshop everything is separate i do like that you can customize it pretty much however you want but make sure you know where you want to put it because moving it is kind of a pain.,11835
2023-11-03,"this is one of my little ""guilty pleasure"" games since most of my games are multiplayer with friends.  i greatly enjoyed portia way back and i already had 350 hours in this game by the time it went 1.0
it was great being back in the my time world and i enjoyed playing it, even though certain aspects of the game i wish were left out (*cough*, woke crap, *cough*).  they actually toned it down for full release which i was happy to see because during the early access it was just too much in your face.  now it is more of an option if you want it, but not ""in your face"" unless you initiate.  good change because we aren't all wanting the same things out of our happy games.",11835

2023-11-02,the npc that sells pots and jars also sells figurines of herself and other townsfolk. there is deep lore if you look for it.,7446
2023-11-02,"graphics - very good but not amazing (edit - they added a new anti aliasing option in 1.0 which is much better!) it is pretty well optimised and loads very fast.
gameplay - great life/farming/building sim. it's not the best in all of its design choices, however, it has an original premise and setting and i have enjoyed my time with it very much as someone who loves games like stardew valley/harvest moon/story of seasons. the combat, while greatly improved from the first game, is still not the best and i tend to not bother with much unless there's items i need. the focus of this game is building and everything else is a bonus.
voice acting - ranges from good to poor. this is probably the weakest aspect of the game for me along with some of the writing.
audio - generally good music and sfx (edit - they improved a lot of the sounds in 1.0 so my complain in this area is gone).

in general it is an great game from devs that care and have kept the community up to date through the early access period. although not perfect, if you liked my time at portia this is better in every way.",7446

2023-11-02,"psa: if you want to play both portia and sandrock, play portia first! the added qol in sandrock makes backtracking to that game somewhat difficult.

the ""my time at..."" series is something truly special. i picked this one up on a sale iirc, back when the story ended with the destruction of the water tower, so i´ve had this game for a while now. kept starting over every time they added a new big feature and am pumped to finally play the full version, as soon as my  unbelievably slow internet connection is finally done downloading.

is this a good game? heck yeah. i can´t remember how many times i only wanted to finish that one request or finish building that one machine and ended up playing until 4am. the characters are all uniquely loveable, even characters i´d absolutely hate in real life (looking at you, arvio...), the quests will keep you going for a long time and the graphics are that beautiful cozy comic style that makes you believe that everything will be alright in the world.

2023-11-02,"this game is very enjoyable. fans of portia will definitely have a good time telling a new story about their time in the ""my time"" universe, but it's still alot of fun if u haven't played my time at portia. i particularly appreciated the sneaky little overlap hints about there being ""another star builder"" in portia ;). sandrock offers a bunch of new fun features like being able to build your house sims-style, and has a very satisfying amount of quests, side quests, and town events. the characters are dynamic, have decent storylines, and are voiced by some talented voice actors. it's easy to get attached. i loved being able to respond to letters in the mail, and feeling like i had a little more input over how i interacted with the city. and not for nothing, my ego enjoyed the good stroking that it got from a town that recognized me as it's heroine and awarded me thusly; something that i felt like i lacked when in portia. i, of course, have my preferences and complaints, but that's only because i love this game/series sooo much that too much is not nearly enough! this is a semi-cozy game, with lots to do and lots to see and it's very obvious that the devs put their hearts and souls into it. i can't wait to see what the ""my time"" gang has next for us! play this! now! it's a good time ^_^",7446

one thing i wanted to mention is an accessibility(?) feature. i'm not disabled, so i can't comment on that, but i have carpel instability in both hands which makes a lot of typing and button pressing painful after a long time. so having the auto-run feature is huge to me. god it really saves my life. controller or pc, even holding the joystick will hurt so pc is better with auto run. not many games offer this feature (stardew does not!) so it really helps me out. thanks devs!!!!!!",7446

the cartooniness can be misleading, it's actually quite a complex game, sort of a mashup of a rpg, singleplayer open world, farming/builder game with interesting npcs and relationships with them.

i see some power-gamer's whining about not having enough stamina to mine the entire world in a day, but they simply have not learned how to play yet.

the key to pacing your game play is based on how quickly you advance the main story quest line. meaning slow down!
if you want to mine more, build, explore, talk to npcs, and feel like you need to catch up, simply don't do the main story quests for a few days, or as long as you want. you control it completely. do not rush the main story quests.

power gamers have to rush everything. this is not that type of experience. slow down and enjoy the journey.",7446
2023-11-02,"it's a good game, runs smooth, story's about as good as a chinese company can make and then half-bake into english. gameplay loop is satisfying as well, with either farming and gathering or combat, crafting, building. the world is... well, about as nice as a desert can be, and you can make it a bit less... desert-y by decorating, at least your plot of land, your house, your farms. character customization is..... decent. base models are expandable enough, plus you can swap out clothes pretty easily, if not a little... grindy, and there's a pretty decent variety as far as things go, nothing groundbreaking but at least nice enough.
however.
we all knew the price was going to hike up a bit on full release, but in addition to that, they waited until after release to drop all the dlc, a very disappointing half-step that the players definitely should have known better about before the game released. if i'd known there was gonna be dlc aafter release, i would have thought twice about even getting it. however, honestly it's still a really solid package, and some dinky cosmetics aren't going to really make or break your gameplay in most cases.
the game is probably a 7/10, it would have been an 8, however i'm not one to take this game's early-access transition dlc hat-trick lightly.
if you like farming and gathering, decorating and just general life-simmery, i would recommend you get it at a discount, it's 40 usd on release but i would get it for 30 at most.

2023-11-02,"this is a wonderful addition to the world of ""my time at"" games! sandrock keeps that familiar feeling of running around smashing out commissions, but what really makes it stand out is the incredible character development of so many different npc's! the developers clearly put their heart and soul into this. thank you for creating such an immersive experience for us!",7446
2023-11-02,"stamina in the game is a big problem. with this new feature you cannot do a lot of things daily and compare to ""my time at portial"", this new game is very stressful because you wont be able to finish all the building quests in time compared to previous game, that was more relaxing.
so for me, i am probably going to play the game with mod that regenarates stamina. but why should i, why there is no option to set game difficulty to be ""normal"" and ""relaxing""?

2023-11-02,"you can spend a lot of time in sandrock, that’s for sure. it’s pretty addictive in fact, but, like most addictions, ultimately just not that much fun…

interactions with townsfolks and monster fights are trite and repetitive, as are most other day-to-day activities: refuel and dust off your equipment, run from place to place (the lack of 'quick travel' becomes tiresome quickly, especially combined with the clunky navigation system), go eat to replenish your extremely limited stamina, desperately try to dig your way to much-needed resources, try to get home before you collapse, rinse, repeat.

much of the game revolves around crafting items within a time limit, but all of these have recursive (and therefore pretty much unforeseeable) dependencies, as well as ""you need this resource, but you can’t get that just yet"" scenarios, making the supposedly-cute grind-breaking interludes that are forced on you from time to time more stressful than anything.

in the end, i had to abandon sandrock because bugs prevented some progress-blocking missions from being completed, and i realized i just didn’t feel like starting a new game in an attempt to set things right. and not starting the game is the best advice i can give prospective players: unless you truly enjoy the 'cow clicking' genre, it’s best to look elsewhere.",7446

2023-11-02,"[h3]kickstarter scam & poor-quality writing[/h3]


i see why this game could make a good first impression to people who never heard of pathea and their games before. graphics and npcs are nice to look at. unfortunately, that’s all.  

gameplay 3/10
difficulty 2/10
graphics 6/10
audio 3/10
story 1/10
sensitivity when it comes to serious topics (trauma, disabilities, death) 0/10
dev support 0/10
false promises 10/10

there sure were lots of problems with their previous game, my time at portia, devs simply weren’t capable to handle resources and promised way too much. the result was and still is an unpolished game full of bugs and missing content for several dateable npcs. console ports are still a mess too, although team17 and pingle are out for several years now and it was all up to pathea after this. last update in 2021 caused more problems than it solved and even more than 2 years later, pathea did nothing but announce some switch performance update. no actual update, no word about problems like missing items, stuck npcs, unplayable missions or fixes for playstation or xbox. they abandoned both, pc and console ports to work on sandrock instead.

there were many promises to learn from previous mistakes with portia and that everything would get better with sandrock. spoiler; [spoiler]it did not.[/spoiler] 

as other negative reviews already pointed out; sandrock kickstarter ended up being a scam.
many people backed because of 100k multiplayer stretch goal, which was easily reached. during early access the multiplayer actually did have story content for a while, just as devs promised. later, they suddenly decided to backtrack and removed it. their excuse; once more bit off more than they could chew and backers just have to accept this. no content, no chance for refund. 

there were more false promises during and after kickstarter. some examples;
- announced timespan for backers to share exclusive content was shortened
- all dateable npcs getting same amount of content - no, it ended up being the same as in mtap
- fixing none working kickstarter dlc codes - not for me
- promise to fix sensitive content - no

even if ignoring all of these mentioned above, i can still not recommend this game. devs took their previous game mtap, added desert location, more generic graphics, some new features and a different writing style. 

while simple gameplay and low difficulty are quite fitting for this genre, their storytelling is unbearable. memes, movie quotes, references, breaking the 4th wall, primitive thirst traps and puns galore, devs admitting at discord to copy entire npcs from disney and others. a ref or joke once in a while is nice though it’s far too much in this case. sandrock feels more like a parody or browsing social media rather than diving into a game with reliable npcs. also, very often those jokes are out of place or go way too far. for example;[spoiler]
- fake kidnapping a traumatized man’s pet to get his attention
- some npc pretending to be disabled because being too lazy to work 
- npc, who is worried their family member might die after already losing another one, is portrayed as fire spitting monster
- making corpulent npc a joke by adding ridiculous amount of food to his room[/spoiler]

devs also came up with the weirdest excuses for missing quality. like saying not to add optional (lol) voice acting for main character because they don’t want to limit players’ vision of their avatar too much. well, they actually don’t mind limiting our vision by bringing mc’s parents and childhood friend to the game, which of course is a way bigger limitation. 

writers are showing a huge lack in sensitivity and even made fun of some players at reddit and discord who brought up their sincere concerns. this behavior is mostly unprofessional.

writing also suffers from missing consistency; plot, timeline, even entire npcs. especially recurring npcs from mtap. [spoiler]mint’s whole backstory and childhood were changed to promote qi, ginger became implausible careless, not following doctors’ advices anymore, gale prioritizes rather meaningless daily work over his precious daughter and leaves her behind, while the formerly cold, detached and standoffish gust now is loud, unjustifiably aggressive and violent to make players sympathize with director’s favorite npc fang, who is permanently portrayed as everyone’s victim.[/spoiler] which leads to another problem; playing favorites. if you’re not interested in sad novel trope fang or stereotype himbo logan, be aware your favorite npc doesn’t get much content since writers focus on those two heavily.

i gave pathea a chance and wanted to support their growth. there’s nothing wrong with making mistakes if you’re willing to learn from them and show process. quite disappointing, this isn’t the case with pathea and sandrock. same mistakes all over again and even adding new ones. this is why i can’t recommend this game.

-tons of equipment/crafting to do

compared to my time at portia, mtas is a huge step up and has improved almost every aspect of the previous game, even though mtap was a great by itself.
can't wait for the next installment of the my time series to be announced.",2263
2023-11-01,"i talked to a phone booth in the game that told me to leave a review with feedback, so i'm gonna do that!

this game's totally worth the asking price as-is, really elevates the farm life genre beyond stardew valley in pretty much every way (i loved stardew!), and offers a scintillating post-apocalyptic desert setting that feels really novel.

this game clearly has a lot to say about the way capital and a self-serving government can funnel money to prop up those who are already successful whilst leaving struggling communities to languish. there are tons of quests and side quests where characters ask if you can spot them money because the economy in sandrock is awful, and public servants will frequently lament the difficulty the town has getting government grants and the belief the residents should 'just move somewhere nicer' without regard for the town's unique culture or the financial hurdles one must jump over to be able to afford moving.

i'm still not done with the game's main story line even 80 hours in, but i'm excited to see how it further develops arguments between characters about the potential perils of technological advancement, because it seems like the game's religious faction is on the verge of lashing out at sandrock's local government for making use of scientific advancements to try and make the desert environment more habitable.

the game's premise also allows it to offer critique on world politics and modern society from the perspective of characters who are discovering information about us hundreds of years in the future. in the 'my time at' series' lore, to really simplify it, technology progressed with little oversight or regulation which made it trivially easy to start a world war that decimated most (all?) of the planet's surface and plunged the world into a new dark age, with people living underground until they were able to return to the surface and rebuild on top of the ruins.

i was surprised by the way this game tackles criticisms of the genre as being centered on mindless extractivism; the rationing of water from the local supply is a serious gameplay factory to account for, the logistical challenges of importing water from other towns is discussed frequently, and you're told as soon as you start the game that logging is illegal due to how few trees there are. plus there's a serious focus on scavenging for scraps and re-purposing those into materials.

this game really surprised me; i had kind of written it off because i thought the art style was a touch off-putting, but the narrative, character writing, and gameplay loops have all charmed and hooked me.

now, because that phone booth said the developers read reviews of the game for feedback, here's some very specific complaints i'd like addressed:

1. i'm in the summer of year two, partway through the bronco the kid quests, and i keep getting building commissions for items i cannot complete because i haven't met musa yet, which means i haven't gained access to the areas that unlock when he shows up in town. some of the commissions i've seen posted but can't complete are industrial machine tools, the advanced civil processor, and chromium daggers. i have these recipes already because i've been diligent about doing machine research with qi and buying recipes from the commerce guild, but i think the game should check to see whether the player has the ability to get the materials necessary to make something before it pops up as a commission.

2. after you first get the chance to express romantic interest in elsie, there's a line of dialogue where she declares 'i'm a legal adult' in frustration at the way her parents treat her. i appreciate the effort to make it clear she's not too young to ethically date, but she's very childish, and that line just makes her sound more childish. the mention of legality feels like a reassurance to the player, which doesn't make for good character dialog.

3. at some point, jumping with my camel started causing the game to freeze in the air for a half-second, after which it hits the ground and all four hoof-hitting-ground sounds play one right after the other. i swear the jumping animation used to be way smoother without that hitch and without the weird sound; i don't have performance issues in this game, so it's not lag as far as i can tell.

4. sometimes machines will get stuck saying they need to have the sand cleaned out of them, and no matter how many different positions or angles i try i cannot see a sand pile to remove with my duster. i found that picking the machine up and putting it back down fixes it temporarily, but i would prefer to just not have that issue, it's annoying having to finesse the position of a civil furnace that sits between two other furnaces.

5. i need storage to be sortable across all boxes instead of the 'sort' option just sorting that individual storage box, as well as the ability to search for an item in storage by name. i would also like for storage to always be accessible when you're gifting a character something. it's frustrating going through my 10? 12? large storage boxes, each with two pages of items to scroll through, especially since item names are only visible by using the left stick and going over every item.

6. finding relic parts for qi's side quests is too time consuming. i would prefer the quest-necessary relic pieces be located in chests in the ruins rather than in the dirt; i haven't found the scanner particularly effective at locating the quest pieces, so i've just been hitting every piece of dirt i can find on every floor hoping to uncover a relic piece eventually, which is extremely tedious when i also really need to move on to a new floor for the ores so i have the materials to complete my commissions.

7. the lack of tin scrap makes bronze more difficult to craft than stuff like chromium or manganese steel, and i'm not sure why that's the case given bronze is required for crafting so many different things.

8. there should be an option to turn on alerts for commissions that are going to expire that day. even if you're tracking your commissions that are due the soonest, you won't see when the commission expires on the main screen.

9. the shop interface should tell you whether clothing/accessories are better or worse than your current gear; i can't really compare my gear when it's all named something like 'stunt rider desert warrior visor' or 'bright defense team boots' since those names don't convey anything about their stats. it's also a struggle to remember my shirt provides, for example, '+136 health + 17 stamina +5% critical hit chance + negates poison status effects' when i'm in a shop going through a bunch of different shirts all with different stat buffs and effects.

10. add a setting that lets run be set as the default movement speed, please. using the 'toggle' doesn't work because there a bunch of annoying circumstances where the game toggles the player back to walking.

11. it's pretty easy to get stuck on obstacles in the sandrunning competition, and i lost a race because i got stuck under a boost pad ramp after hitting it from the side and had to forfeit to get out.

all of that said though, it's a great game, i'm looking forward to getting through the main story so i can go try my time at portia after this!",2157

i dearly loved my time at portia, so it was nice to see all the advancements made in mtas to make playing an even better experience, yet keeping the charm and connected storytelling from portia. 

also did beta testing for both mp and sp - thank you pathea! - it has been an awesome experience that i've cherished. look forward to your next games in the my time series as they have only gotten better and more immersive. love the increased battles too, it has been a lot of fun. i tend to laugh and be a bit salty when battling, but it amuses my son as i hear him laughing at me from the next room then checking on me/what i'm doing. i'd stopped gaming for a long time, but portia got me back into it and i'm really happy i bought portia and kept going to experience sandrock. the series is only getting better and has so much potential. i have over 2500 hours in sandrock so far- and still feel i'm learning and experiencing new things as you can play the game in so many ways to keep it feeling fresh and yet familiar. thank you pathea for creating such a wonderful place to go each day and bring joy to daily life for so many of us.",2237

2023-10-26,"if you are looking for a game similar to startew valley then i do not recommend
my time at sandrock. i don't know why game designers think limits are cool for gamers. balanced play is not the same as limits on everything. farming and fishing is boring the same as fighting monsters etc.  the game has some interesting ideas that i think were wasted by boring gameplay and incomprehensible limitations.",2257
2023-10-24,"my time at sandrock is a fun farm/life sandbox game and the sequel to my time at portia, which i also recommend.

good:

housing is a big factor when it comes to farming games, in this game you can customize your farm however you want, you can make your land mainly like a factory, farm or a beautiful homestead while not worrying about the other two as much.

commissions are the main money maker in the game that also rewards you with a good amount of relationship for certain characters and workshop reputation points. i highly recommend doing these daily and picking the most profitable ones as money is more important than the other two rewards.

saving midday is not a common thing to happen in farm/life sim games and that is why i really like this game, (portia doesn't have this feature). also that comes with midday saves is when you complete a quest or commission you auto save and have a quick save which is really handy to have.

there are a large variety of weapons, you can have 4 types of melee weapons, multiple ranged weapons and even some unique weapons that can't be crafted. each melee weapon has its own style and combo, whether it be daggers for fast but weak attacks or a greatsword which is slow but does a lot of damage.

decent:

relationships in this game follows every other farm/life sim game, there isn't a weekly limit but if you give an item too much they will like it less. the game is good at indicating if there is a relationship event going on as it will be marked on your map but the game doesn't really tell you if you even have events available for a character or if it is just end of current build.

there is a skill tree that you can do, but maxing out those 4 skills basically just fill up the entire tree leaving no real choice in the end. skill points are only gained by doing those specific skills. though i do think this idea is pretty neat, i will always prefer character levels rewarding skill points (portia did this).

farming had a step-up from portia, where you are able to place farming plots anywhere on your land instead of planter boxes. you can easily and efficiently plant items the higher the toolbox up to a 4x4 planting/watering/fertilizing area which is quick and easy. farming has some flaws as well, farming early game is terrible. since it is just inefficient. you have to apply a lot of fertilizer, water and straw just to make a profit, you can't automate farming either so you have to constantly be on watch to water.

bad:

!!they added the feature to group items and move them in bulk in the 1.0 update!!

moving housing items is a real chore, there is no area select so you have to move each individual item one by one (including farming plots). i would just recommend using your character instead at some points. moving your house with 2+ stories is also annoying as whenever you move it, you have to move each individual story top to bottom and if you had items in the house after reapplying those stories, some might get removed since staircases don't remember their last known location but instead have a predetermined location every time you add a new floor.",2332
2023-10-24,"love this game. my time at portia was nice too and i liked the theme more but sandrock is just too big. its a fun casual game with less need of micromanagement and something you can enjoy at your pace.
",2332
2023-10-24,"23 oct 23:
the story has an intriguing story and it is quite rewarding to see the impact you make on sandrock. without any spoilers, i'm very much looking forward to the next chapter in the ""my time"" world. i think most of the characters feel unique (to the other townsfolk, at least). the romance storylines i followed were sweet, but there are some characters that you will not interact with or be able to romance until very late game, which is kind of frustrating.

but to be honest, the game has a laundry list of basic quality audio, graphics, and  issues, even as the release date is right around the corner. also, if you grind through the storylines, some progression issues and quest overlapping are going to happen (at least during the pre-release phases).

much like its moniker, sandrock needs further polishing before it becomes ""the jewel of the eufala"".",2332

2023-10-26,"[h1] basically mtap but better and more [/h1]
[h2] tl;dr [/h2]
basically, if you've played and enjoyed my time at portia, you'll enjoy this as it's more of the same but higher quality, there's more content, some of the kinks have been worked out and generally this is what i would classify as a good sequel.

if you haven't played mtap: this is essentially a ""cozy"" farm life sim game with all the genre staples (npc relationships, expanding operations, planning your day and your season in order to maximize €$, home customization, yada yada bing bong), except replace ""farm"" with ""mechanic"".
you take on requests for materials and finished products which progress in complexity as you upgrade and expand your workshop with new machines, better equipment, et cetera.

the game offers some customization of your experience, including a slider that speeds up or slows down the passage of in-game time. if you're into this genre of games, you will like this game. it's well put together, i personally haven't encountered any breaking bugs, it performs well, it looks nice and there's a lot to do.
[hr][/hr]

[h2]in detail[/h2]
[h3]the good[/h3]
[b]graphical quality[/b]
the game is quite a step up from portia, and comparing it to other offerings within the genre that adopt 3d visuals, i think only harvestella has it beat, in terms of technical quality (shaders, lighting, texture work et cetera) and details such as tufts of grass bobbing in the wind, sand particles and dust clouds blowing over arid terrain, npcs and mobs reacting to things happening around them.

[b]performance[/b]
i'm playing this on deck. when i first tried this on deck when i bought it roughly a year ago, i was forced to put the settings to a low preset, and my deck struggled to maintain 30fps. in the current version, in the year of our lord 2023, i have every graphical setting maxed out and the game is running between 30 and 60 fps on average. easily hitting 60fps in interiors.
all in all, with how the game looks, i think the performance is pretty impressive.

[b]sheer volume of content[/b]
i'm roughly 20 hours in to a new save on this version, and it feels as though i have yet to finish the first chapter in the story - i'm still witnessing new character introductions, npcs treat me as the ""new builder"". at the same time, literally every day since starting the game (i'm roughly at the end of the first in-game month) i've started the day with a new unique situation unfolding that day, ranging between character plot and main story beats, sometimes unlocking new features, sometimes unlocking new areas, sometimes just offering up new insights in characters or the world.
there also appears to be quite a breath of content. i haven't dipped my to into every system yet - i honestly don't even know roughly how much of the systems on offer i've engaged with. however, on top of the workshop, it appears you also gain access to more traditional elements such as farming plots and animal keeping. then there's a whole slew of activities available on certain days of the week, usually small in scope but quite numerous, such as making weekly deliveries of clay to the pottery artisan or helping with cleaning up the communal water supply. these may be simple activities, but they do help build a sense of community and add authenticity to the setting.
there's a lot more, but i can't be arsed getting in to it. just know that the main meat of the game (running the workshop) has quite a bit of depth, and at the same time there's breadth of content in the periphery.

[b]writing[/b]
people who played mtap know this already - the writers at pathea seem to have quite a bit of fun adding character to, well, the characters. this games' script has a lot of moving parts: when certain events trigger is directly influenced by your actions as a player, so the order in which events happen can't be guaranteed. despite this, the tone of the script is quite consistent. even if when you jump from a serious scene where the titular town is under assault to one where a writer is receiving eloquently phrased harsh critiques from a kid (""i'm in your tawget demogwaphic"" cracked me up) and you can see his heart break a little. this is all backed up by surprisingly good voice acting. the voice cast is varied, mostly fits the characters being depicted and the direction is excellent. this is a step up from portia.
i think they spent more time proofreading the game script as well, as even the little stuff like item and skill descriptions have been immaculate so far.

[b]game flow[/b]
this is hard to pin down exactly, but the game flows really well once you get into the rhythm of it. anyone who's played a game in this genre will know what i mean by that; you get into a routine, find out what works and what doesn't, and then you start scaling up and becoming a giant capitalist with a zillion weird lil machines churning out products, earning you a tidy profit. in sandrock, somehow, even early game resources kept feeling worthwhile to amass, and i ended up doing my best to figure out what to spend the day in in order to keep the machines running with stuff which would allow me to most efficiently complete next days' comissions.


[h3]the subjective[/h3]
[b]character art[/b]
love it or hate it, portia character designs were distinct. in sandrock, the style is a bit less pronounced. personally, i like it better this way, as i found the portia characters veered between distinct and grotesque.

[b]focus/direction[/b]
this game definitely requires you to explore and experiment a bit. a lot of information is available in-game, especially once you've discovered something e.g. a material will have details on how to procure it once obtained.

[h3]the bad[/h3]
[b]a sense of confusion and/or being overwhelmed[/b]
this game has the exact same issue as portia: it's front-loaded, and it doesn't always succeed in explaining all of its' mechanics due to the sheer amount of stuff there is to see and do. some things go completely unexplained and just sit there in the ui, staring at you accusatorily, daring you to interact with them and finding out what will happen. 
there's a lot of systems which is all fine and dandy, but you're also not incentivized to take your time figuring them all out. this makes especially the first few days of the game play out in a hectic fashion. i had to re-learn a bunch since it's been a hot minute since playing mtap, and starting this fresh would probably be worse. it's a shame, because i can imagine people being scared off by this. heck, i put down portia and almost never came back to it when i first played it, due to this exact issue.

[b]simultaneously polished and full of skung[/b]
this game contains nintendo levels of detail and polish in some areas, and gets extremely skungy in others, and these disparate levels of polish overlap at times. to illustrate: i'm watching a nicely choreographed cutscene complete with great lighting and what appears to be a blend of mo-cap and manually done character animations, lending it legitimacy while keeping consistent with the general art direction of the game. the cutscene ends. my character automatically starts pathing towards an arbitrary position, gets snagged on a fence, runs in place for a moment, phases out of existence, reappears a few meters away, and two npcs pop in next to them. all the while little shrubs are waving in the wind as a tumbleweed rolls by in the beautifully rendered sand drifts.
to be honest, this could be seen as a positive as well, considering the fact that all of portia nested comfortably in the janky skungzone, so it's a triump pathea have managed to elevate their work to this level. however, the disparity means that the skungness stands out more admidst the nintendonean polish levels, whereas in portia the entire vibe was skung so it just fit.",2257
2023-10-23,"[h3]wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle[/h3]

the #1 issue with this game is bloat. according to the devs, the story is 3.29 times longer than my time at portia – already a pretty long game, mind you. i know “more game” is supposed to be good, but sandrock overstays its welcome and makes you wonder when it finally ends. imagine watching a movie, and after an epic showdown with the main villain, when you’re ready for the credits to roll - another movie begins instead. it means you need many hours of your life to complete the story in one sitting and not lose track of it. there are more than twice side quests than portia, too - and most of them are on a timer. i ended up so overwhelmed by quests that i began refusing them at some point, which in turn led to a frustrating feeling of missing out on content. there is more of everything else as well. there are hundreds of items - scrap alone comes in like 15 varieties - making inventory management an ever-present annoying part of the gameplay. 

if a developer from pathea is reading this - i would like you to grab a sheet of paper, write “less is more” on it, then hang it somewhere in the office where everyone can see it every day. i have no need for 20 romantic interests in the game, if the majority of them will lack character, quests, unique items, voice acting... give me just 3 but make them really fleshed out and rich with content. case in point: nia - she got so much backstory, relevance to the plot, unique events and ties to the main character that she makes every other romance look like an unnecessary waste of development resources.

[h3]cardboard protagonist[/h3]

sandrock is a heavily narrative-driven game. for 100-150 hours you will be listening to dialogue with multiple people, constantly referencing your character. for some reason, even though your character is not a “blank slate” and has a backstory, parents, childhood friend etc. you are free to name him/her whatever you want. this creates a huge problem for voice actors. you see, expecting them to voice dozens of custom names like codsworth or vasco would be unrealistic, so they only had two options - either skip the player character’s name entirely, or to use generic “the builder”. as a result, dialogue constantly loses meaning and feels jarring. for example, “me, harris and you will go to the cave” turns into “me and you will go to the cave”; “s.s. harris” (ship name) turns into “s.s.” (???), and even though you can be a best friend to people and marry them, they will still refer to you as “the builder” (even if there are other builders present in the same scene). 

what exacerbates this issue is the silent protagonist. which on its own perhaps wouldn’t be that bad - if mi-an didn’t exist. mi-an is also a builder, and so in most scenes she effectively speaks for both of you and ends up praised for things you did. all leading to a feeling of the player character being a sidekick to mi-an. while i realize voicing the whole 250.000 words main story is unrealistic, this just leads back to my point - why did they write a huge story like that?

[h3]howdy, pardner![/h3]

sandrock feels awfully derivative - it just grabs about every single gameplay element and design decision from portia and carefully copy/pastes them into a new game. the only meaningful difference here is the new desert setting, and frankly - it’s terrible and doesn’t work for a game like this. you will struggle to tell the seasons apart - it’s always just sand, with the (very) subtle coat of white in winter and green in spring. outside of an occasional sandstorm the weather is also static for the most part – you will not see any snow and i only witnessed rain 1 (one!) time after 100+ hours into the game. of course, there are setting-based complications: like you need water (rare and expensive) to cool your machines; sand accumulates on them over time so you need to clean it; you are not allowed to chop trees near the city etc. however, ultimately all of it feels like busywork, aimed at making your early game more painful and tedious than it needs to be.

narratively, it’s just a mix of every wild west cliché. your will hear “howdy!” from about every character, even the newcomers. there are sheriffs, bandits, cowb... i mean, yakboys. which i could probably live with, but the huge appeal of a my time game is to be able to improve your community and see a meaningful impact of your actions over time. i still remember building a fast travel system in portia and how much of an achievement it felt. here the main theme is greenification of the desert however, which essentially makes you feel like a sidekick to botanist characters and a glorified gardener, as the builder stuff takes a backstage to planting trees. furthermore, the first half of the exceedingly long story just has you doing barely meaningful stuff, with the common theme being “bandits broke our bench/water tower/farm/statue - please repair it!”. yes, there are guns now - but they feel like a gimmick, requiring entering an “aiming” mode, and are so ammo-hungry that using them is just not sustainable, unless you enjoy grinding mines to make more bullets. you do get the ability to join civil corps as a deputy this time round, but ultimately this only serves to further distract you into becoming a “jack of all trades”.

[h3]rpg and progression[/h3]

sandrock tries to be more of an rpg, with everything from your chair to your horse coming in multiple tiers of quality. you can also “refine” an item to increase its level and quality by throwing rare gems you first have to grind at it. at first i thought this to be a very cool system, as i imagined it would be possible to upgrade any piece of clothing indefinitely and make it competitive in the late game - but you’re only able to upgrade anything up to 10 levels above its “required level”, making the system pointless. furthermore, this system only made matters worse as for the first half of the game i had to actively avoid the “blue” quality commissions - because i simply did not have the required gems at the time to make such quality items.

also, while there are levels and skill points – you will easily unlock everything provided you play long enough, so there are no builds or anything like that. the perks are subtle buffs rather than something that has great impact over the gameplay. as such, the main form of progression comes in the form of gear - and is fully tied to the main story, which unlocks more areas and resources. while you unlock bronze and iron relatively early on and at a steady pace, it is unfortunately followed by a very long and stale midgame where you don’t unlock anything until late game, where you get chromium and aluminum almost back to back.

[h3]writing[/h3]

sandrock is filled to the brim with memes and popular culture references, and every quest title is an attempt at a witty pun. it all looks quaint and fun at first, but quickly grows exhausting, especially as the writers make npc go more and more out of character just to throw in another “mic drop!”. the writing feels too concerned with the “current day” agenda for a game that’s supposed to take place in a post apocalyptic setting. for example, a woman i offered my help said she does not accept “free help” from strangers, and almost reported me for sexual harassment. and after that a homosexual man made advances on my male character without my consent, or ever speaking to that particular character to begin with. some characters are so obnoxious i found it really hard to co-exist with them in the same game.

[h3]tl;dr upgrade? more like side-grade![/h3]

my time at sandrock was almost 200 hours full of adventure and emotions. just like portia, this game has quite a few enjoyable things. pretty graphics, some quality of life additions, even the optimization is finally half-decent! unfortunately, all the diamonds are buried deeply under the sand of a game that is too ambitious for its own good.

2023-10-21,"having finished the game i can say this game was much, much bigger than my time at portia to begin with.

now for the rest of the game, i've loved it, i think i would have loved it even more if i hadn't played it piecemeal from the early access so everyone gets it better now waiting for the full release.

the story is fun and delightful with nice complete arcs.

i find myself loving everything around, the characters are delightful and varied with their personalities. 

the quests all seem to make sense and the side quests are nice, the main quests mostly aren't timed so you set your pace, mostly... there are forced gaps/delays, so if you are like me that means breakneck speed. core gameplay loop is solid.

though my favorite self-indulgence in this game is the fact that everything you make that is bigger than hand sized exists in the world. you can go out and see it all, from elevators, to shrubs, to buildings and more.  the world really does change with your actions and it shows there in the world, 

there are still some bugs and little minor things but as long as you don't care too much you will enjoy the game.",3009
2023-10-21,"if you played and liked my time at portia, go ahead and grab this. it's a bigger and better game in basically every way.

if you haven't played it, well, this is a farming game where you don't farm much. specially because now you are in the middle of the desert, and you can't just fill your watering can from a well. instead, most of what you do is building; do some ruin diving, collect resources, smelt ore, and bang out the things sandrockers commission you to make. sleep and repeat.

in the meantime, you will have the chance to get to know these colorful characters better and learn a fair bit about the post-apocalyptic world they live in. with a much longer duration, this game manages to flesh out much of the worldbuilding the first title only alluded to.

production values are not in the aaa ballpark. the ea version i played had some pretty bad pop-in issues, and while most of the dialogue is voiced, some side content isn't. still, this is a game with heart, and if you are looking for something cozy to put a solid hundred hours in, you can certainly do a lot worse.",3009

2023-10-20,"one of my favourite games, ever.
the story is engaging (200 hrs and i'm still not finished), the characters are interesting and lovable, the scenery is gorgeous, the pets are so. freaking. cute. and the controls are never clunky. i despise grinding in farming/crafting sims and that was not a problem here.
plenty of clothing and customisation options (could use a few more hairstyles), diverse cast and plenty to do at all times.
this game is visually stunning, has tons of character and the dialogue is super funny, i was not expecting to laugh so much. i was very invested in the main story, and everytime i felt smug about accurately predicting something, another twist would knock me off my pedestal. 
weeks before full release, my only qualms with this game are sandfishing (annoying but easily ignored) and building/decorating your house. there are too many size and placement restrictions for my taste. the other sets look great with similar assets that we have access to, so i'm hopeful for improvement.

if you're like me and couldn't get into portia, sandrock exceeds its predecessor in every way and is worth another try.
all in all, a marvellous achievement. bravo, pathea.",2515
2023-10-20,"first steam review... i love this game and i loved my time at portia as well. this is a great sequel that feels endless. i love the customization they added to this game and if you're having hesitations, i say go for it. i waited months until i got it on sale and thought i'd leave it alone until full release... that obviously didn't happen hahha. i got curious opened up the game and have been enjoying it immensely despite the initial hesitation i had from other reviews.  all in all this game is loads of fun and  makes a nice sequel to its predecessor with added bonus of even more content and more interesting npc's.",2515

2023-10-20,"this game is so much fun, i think i enjoyed all the character's personalities and the many voice actors the game had. i read a review before that said there is always a reason to do just one more day. this is so true. i'm about 120 hours game play in. i like to spend a lot of time doing side quests, gathering, and building. i want to be a rich builder. i just now got through a major plot in the story. i'm sure there is still hours of game play left. i played portia before when it first came out on switch. i struggled with it for some reason. building was hard for me and... i gave up. now that i played this one on pc, i think i'm actually ready to go back and give portia a try again. the story and all the mentions of portia makes me want to play it because i read that the timelines of the game are actually parallel? so while we are working hard to grow sandrock, there is a ""star builder"" in portia working hard to grow portia. now i must know the story! 
what i disliked is a pretty small list. the mounts can be a little glitch sometimes when they are following you. other times for some reason i can't seem to interact with an object, i have to run around and click on other things then try to come back to it. the most annoying one is sometimes if i have to pause and go out of game to do something on my desktop. when i come back, the mouse is missing and i can't click on stuff in my inventory. i normally have to save and restart for it to fix. pretty minor dislikes, none of them break the game. oh and for some reason when i pose with my camel a certain pose, the bottom of his mouth disappears! its creepy what the inside of his mouth looks like with no bottom of his face.",2515
2023-10-17,"tldr - this game is a gem with lots to do to keep you busy and runs well with minimal bugs.

   long main story, tons of sides, loveable characters, and scratches that builder itch you may have.  most of the lines are voice acted.  can get repetitive later levels and the story, whilst good, goes off the rails.  overall totally worth the price per content as in my first play though took 140 hours and i still didn't do everything i wanted... on play through 2 this time for a better set up to /romance all the characters =p.  oh, and you can save almost anytime minus like a super important event, but can usually save before or after, you don't have to wait for the sleep cycle.

  there are minor bugs, usually fixed with a reload.  some resources are a little too limited imo that commissions will flood your board.  resources start getting cluttered late game.  some features that were in portia are not here.  the game is set up for dlcs, which is fine.  i'm curious to see the generation features.  one of my npc couples had a baby later in the game, was a total mind melt, though this feature for the main character won't be released till launch.
 
  i can't really comment on the multiplayer aspect, only from what i've read from other users.  but, i'm judging this game as a standalone single player experience.  and at it's core, is a great game.  if there was some way to make multiplayer have different homesteads, i think that would make it ideal, but i think it's just sharing one property.

2023-10-16,"this game has consumed my life. the building, the story, the in depth characters all 10/10. does it have some bugs? sure.  does owen occasionally appear on top of a tree? sure. i haven't personally experienced anything game breaking, and have greatly enjoyed playing along since day one of early access. cheers panthea, you've absolutely nailed it and made one of my all time favourite games. can't wait to replay on full release and play whatever you make next.",2742
2023-10-16,"this game is amazing, easily in my top 5 right now. i started playing a few weeks ago (never played my time at portia so i was a little unsure on what to expect) but my time at sandrock has surprised me every single time i played it. from the characters, to the dialogs, to the story! hells, i wasn't expecting such a great story from a farming/life simulator game! i was hooked since the very begining and after 130h+ i still have to finish act 3.
i can't wait till november 2 to finally play the ""complete"" version of the game, but so far it's been an amazing journey and i will definitely keep playing the game for a long time, romancing different characters, replaying the story, enjoying everything this amazing world has to offer. thank you to everyone that has made this game possible, i love it.",2742
2023-10-16,"short review (haven't played portia): small town gets a new worker (you!) who does stuff and has a social life. recommend playing if you like cozy and relaxing games. lots to do, funny and can be heartwarming at times. some farming, some gathering, some fighting and everything in 3d

pros:
+ a little different than the normal farming games
+ 3d
+ like the combat, you can even... roll with invincibility frames!
+ when does the main story end?! (aka: a lot of stuff and it takes a long time to get there)
+ humorous
+ spending time with someone means doing stuff!
(+ references to portia)

cons:
- ea gives some bugs / missing stuff / wrong voicelines / buggy mounts
- placing stuff / decorating could have been easier
(- you will play a lot. this game will be your social life ;) )",2742

2023-10-16,"i literally have been playing nonstop for like a month now and as much as i'm binge-playing it, i want it to last and never end. it's that good ;-;. great sequel to my time at portia, although you don't really need to have played that one to understand this one as they each hold on by ithemselves (but you should play mtap too!). big fan of the npcs and all their unique personalities. big fan of how cozy and wholesome it is despite its' post-apocalypse(?) theme. big fan of pathea games from now on. :)",2742
2023-10-15,"i loved my time in portia, so when another title in the ""my time in"" universe got announced i was excited, thrilled and i was right about it. the developer likes to brag about how much more stuff there is in sandrock than it was in portia and you can feel that. the quests are even better, the story is at least as interesting as in portia, the characters as lovely as it gets while be unique in town. sandrock is definitely not a copy&paste, even though you feel like becoming a part of a family, just like back in portia. you should give it a try.",3497

2023-10-10,"the story line has been impressing me, after ~150 hours of playing, and i'm not even done with it yet",2733
2023-10-20,"wanted to write this before the official release of the game. 

i have 221 hours played on this game, spread over about three saves. if that doesn't speak about how much stuff there is to do, even in early access, then i don't know what would. 

obviously, the start was a bit rough, but overall the game was still pretty good. it continued improving as pathea kept listening to player feedback and making good decisions, eventually leaving me to believe it's one of, if not the, best game of its kind. beating even, i know i'll get questioned for this but whatever, stardew. it easily crushes portia, too. i loved portia, but sandrock improved on soooo much. in portia, it feels like you were just shoved into having to make a bunch of commissions, but in sandrock you get introduced to everything one at a time, which makes it easy to pick up. it also made it so it's much easier (and quicker) to start a relationship with a person, but i'll get into that later.

the main thing of the story is uncovering the truth about what's been going on in sandrock. the geeglers, the insidious, but dashingly handsome bandit logan, and even... an evil empire?! you'll play throughout all these events and make the town a thriving success like it used to be. you'll meet a ton of loveable, or annoying (yan), characters and get to know them and their story as you progress through the game.

another improvement is the combat. combat felt slow and sluggish in portia, and most farming/sim/crafting/rpg games do it poorly, but sandrock makes combat interesting and a little more interactive. it may not be overwhelmingly complex, but it's also not move and click. there are a few different melee weapons, each with their own bonus stat and fighting style, and then three, i think, ranged weapons: a pistol, rifle, shotgun. as i said, combat isn't super easy or simple, but it also isn't too hard. i think it's a definite improvement from portia and games like coral island or stardew that just have you face an enemy and spam click.

now i know i've compared this game to stardew twice already, and i will admit, it's not fair. both are great games with two massively different playstles. but i am judging both as a game about farming and/or crafting and social sims, like they both are, to some degree, but sandrock is a lot more story-oriented and emphasizes on combat, crafting, and exploration. so i'll stop comparing the two!

now on to make this simple:

character creation + development - 7/10. i want to give this a higher rating, but the character customization is lacking, especially for the males with no good facial hair options. maybe that'll change in the official release? idunno. anyway, i give it a 7 because you can get your character to a good looking person, and then the development of that character, including the adventures they go through and how you choose to treat people, matters too. i think it's a beautiful example of the fact that, sometimes, one person can make all the difference.

combat - 8/10. a good rating, i enjoyed the combat greatly. obviously it's no dark souls or anything like that, but it's a huge improvement from portia. and being able to choose a weapon you specialize in, or just specializing into all of them and switching between them, is so fluid and nice; especially when you get the shotgun. good lord is that fun.

exploration - 6/10. this would also be higher, but sadly a lot of the exploration is gated behind time and requirements. but when you do unlock a new zone, there isn't much to explore. yeah you get new materials to craft new and better equipment, but it does feel like you're stuck in a desert and can't go anywhere. 

socializing/romance - 9/10 beautiful! i loved getting to know all the characters in sandrock. i even got to bff with almost every available npc and got to know their story, though some of it came from game progression. but the romance is so much easier and better than portia. you can give gifts, go on ""play dates"" and eventually go on real dates and then get married! i haven't really dabbled in the marriage part because nia isn't available for romance yet as of writing this. *shakes fist* but i do know there are even children to be had! exciting! you won't get bored of any of these lovely sandrockers. 

graphics - 10/10 for the type of the game it is, the graphics are gorgeous. i love farming/dating sims, but usually have to settle for less-than appealing graphics, like potion permit, sun haven, etc. but with sandrock, you don't have to settle! they definitely made better looking people and areas than in portia. i hated how the heads were in portia, but in sandrock, it's all good, baby!

overall; the game is just.. awesome. i give it a solid 8/10, i have a few gripes and problems with it, as with every game to be fair, but maybe that'll change in the official release. is it worth it full price? heck yes! buy it. you will not be disappointed. it has a lot of replay-ability and tons of content. and here's hoping we'll get more content as time goes on! but yeah, that's my review of sandrock. i never write reviews for games unless they leave a great impression on me, i think the only other review i've ever made is on stardew. but yeah, anyway, sorry to digress. i definitely recommend the game, especially if it's on sale? heck of a deal. 

get it. play it.

and remember! 

conserve water!",2515
2023-10-15,"i can tell this is still early access - i've run into a few bugs here and there (nothing major, one's purely visual and the other didn't prevent me from finishing the quest, so that's fine. devs - when i went to do the part time help quest, i had 5 manure in my inventory already so it was flagging the quest as done, but cooper wouldn't accept it until i picked up 5 manure)

minor bugs so far aside, it's a super fun game that builds on the things in my time at portia, while also changing things up enough to feel distinct as a game. i'm really enjoying my time so far, and i look forward to seeing how the rest of the game goes!",3497
2023-10-15,"i prefer to play simulation games on handheld platforms, so i'm pretty sad to see there's no real functionality on the steam deck despite there being a switch release in the lineup. on deck, the main menu just freezes once you've made your first selection and you can't back out or move forward, though the store lists it as ""playable"". i know the game is still in early access despite the full release version popping up when i load in, so hopefully this will change, because i really loved what little i played through on my pc last year.",3497

2023-10-13,"loads of content, enjoyable and rewarding game loop",2729
2023-10-13,"what a massive improvement from my time in portia, which was already an incredible game! 
many many improvements overall. most notably the graphics, improved character models, visuals & aesthetics of the game! 

the biggest and greatest change for me. is the storage. yes correct, storage and inventory management is a thing of the past with this new system! you can now auto-store all stacks of items across all your stashes at once! thus allowing you to keep unique items on you, but stack up all your inventory junk instantaneously. 
not only that. but your stashes act as a sort of backpack now. anything in your stashes count as being on your person for the sake of crafting, handing in commissions etc.. 
this is a game changer as the most tedious park of portia that burnt me out and prevented me from completing it. was the constant inventory management. in sandrock you can now auto-store all stacks then continue the focus on having fun! 

and boy is it fun! there is 2-4x the content than in portia, and with inventory management to the wayside. you can really dive in and just get lost in the experience!

i can't really find any faults with the game. for the price you are paying this is def a 10/10 product imo.",2729

2023-10-13,"great game, lots of options",2729
2023-10-13,"this game is still in early access so my feedback is based on this. 
i cannot recommend this game enough! i've been playing early access since about january this year and it's been incredible to see the game grow, as well as seeing how much the devs care about player feedback and incorporates it into the game. i've played through it a couple of times now and am still eager for the full release, as it's got solid replayability. 

pros:
+ story and writing are well done, fleshed out and engaging (and very funny!). it's also nice to have a post-apocalyptic game with a more positive spin on it, focused on rebuilding the town/nature.
+ engaging with npcs is integrated into the storylines so it feels more organic (rather than having to go out of your way too much to build friendships)
+ fixed lots of qol issues that were present in portia so it's far smoother and quicker to build
+ if you've got cozy game fatigue where it's all farming and fishing, this is a wonderful reprieve from that. while there is farming and fishing involved, it's mainly optional so i tend to avoid it altogether. 
+ so! much! to ! do!

cons
- there are still some bugs, so for those who haven't played i recommend waiting until full release to allow time for polish",2729

although i do recommend going in patiently, its a game where you work to unlock and evolve, there is so much to do. you can take commission requests to build, go on dates with different activities and personal touch, even spar with npcs as friends or play cards. so much to do but i wont spoil that.

2023-10-10,"i love this game! i really enjoyed the first game, my time at portia, and i'm impressed by the improvements both to quality of life and to characterization that sandrock brings. i love that this game isn't just a copy-and-paste of portia on a desert aesthetic; with aspects like needing to keep water in mind, the different resources available (and the ones protected within town), and sandstorms, sandrock feels both like its own game and like a worthy sequel. you don't have to have played portia to enjoy this game, either, as it stands alone very well.

i appreciate that the team working on this game has taken feedback into account. sometimes the audio balancing was a bit off, and certain things were too loud (sorry for avoiding you for so long, sandy!), but after the most recent update those seem to have been pretty much fixed.

one of my favorite things to do while i'm relaxing is to play this game while showing it to my friend. we love the pacing of this game, always having enough to do but not feeling overwhelmed. i appreciate being able to adjust the speed of the passage of time, so we can get all the things done that we want to in a day.

the game is also quite beautiful. i like to bring the in-game camera to various scenes to take pictures and hang them up in my character's house. anyways, this long and rambling review can be summed up by: thank you for making this game! it's by far one of my favorites.",2733
2023-10-09,"i like it overall but some things are annoying - the timeline of events is very quick. just getting a handle on how things worked and you get a talk about how your workshop is only #4 and that they expect more.  there's no real leeway to explore and build.

also, if you play, have a lot of ram. on a good graphics card and 16gig ram it lags to hell for a singleplayer game.  the load screen time are reminiscent of the sims 2.",3019
2023-10-09,"this game is very unique, there isnt many games like this, ive searched for so many romance games but somehow i always seem to come back to either my time at portia or sandrock. so far i really enjoy both of them and their stories are really amazing and i hope that there will be more sequels. as im not done playin  any time soon. atm i got 200+ hr play time. and i really love these games. so i will pray and hope there will be more.

2023-11-08,"if you like the idea of collecting and hoarding mountains of junk and crafting it into a slew of various things then this game may be for you, post 1.0 the game feels very polished and smooth, a league above portia, well done devs (though the writing could certainly use some work)",15199
2023-11-08,probably one of the most fun games i've played in a year that's seen so many great titles. my buddy and i play this every night and there are so many interesting twists and turns. the npc's almost seem to have and pursue their own lives while constantly walking around and creating a lively atmosphere reminiscent of the sims. great job pathea games!,15199
2023-11-08,a little more tedious than portia but still lovable all the same.,15199
2023-10-11,"if you liked my time at portia, then you'll like this game too, or perhaps even better.
after 100 hours into sandrock in 9 days, it's probably time for me to take it slow from now on. i've finished most of the main story stuff at this point but i think there's still a new area to unlock. it's been a long wait for sure. i bought the game the first day it was available on steam and waited till the main story questline was finished to finally play it. i'd say that the wait was worth it. overall, sandrock is better than portia in almost every aspect. i especially enjoyed the story and the characters. however, the game still feels a bit glitchy. there were a few crashes, the interact option sometimes won't appear immediately, my horse can fly, etc. i'll definitely have another playthrough once the definitive version is out (likely a year or so later i guess). 

here's a few things that i enjoyed the most:

1. the world

the view of sandrock is quite breathtaking and i often find it enjoyable just walking amongst the wilderness while gazing at the mountains. the biome and monster design is certainly a whole level better than portia (at least they make sense now). it's also quite rewarding to find little bits of lore here and there. 

2. story and characters

there's a lot more to the story of sandrock than portia, but in order to not spoil anything i'll just say that i liked it a lot. kudos to the writers. it also fleshes out the world a lot more that i'm now looking forward to the third game (please let there be a third game). i like the villains a lot, too. i especially like relatable villains. most of the romanceable characters are interesting and unique. i really enjoyed learning more and more about them and seeing some of them grow as a person. i might be biased, but i feel like the guys have more diverse personalities than the girls? like, i feel like all of the girls are the friendly and approachable type, but some of the guys need a lot more time to warm up to you. i kinda want to see a girl character being a jerk for a change. also, i suspect that unsuur is the dev's favorite considering how many quests he gets lol. 

despite how much i enjoyed the game, here's a few things that i didn't enjoy:

1. pacing (somewhere around mid-game to be more exact)
there's too much waiting mid-game that the game became kinda boring. since i played portia before, i was fairly familiar with the mechanics from the get go so i almost never wasted time on completing mandatory commissions. yet almost every main story quest requires you to wait for at least a day for the story to progress after you finished the job. maybe that's not so bad in itself, but nothing else was going on meanwhile except the main quests. the lag between the second abandoned ruins and the third was ridiculously long, while the forth was unlocked far too quickly in comparison (i hadn't even gotten to the bottom of the third ruins when the next was unlocked). the extremely repetitive guild commissions made it even worse. day in and day out, i was just handing out the same three or four items to the same people. the only thing i needed to gather was ores during that period and digging dirt for ores isn't exactly my idea of fun.

2. rival (or the lack of it...)
higgins was one of my favorite characters in portia and i was pretty disappointed with mi-an. it felt like she was just arbitrarily included in some parts of the story and absent in the rest. her character was rather uninteresting as well to the point the i rarely bothered talk to her. i'd talk to the non-romanceable townsfolk after most main story events but not her, that's how uninterested i was. her character is just inherently 'good' that she never had any character development (or perhaps there is but i'm not friends with her so i didn't get to see her events). the rest of the guild was just a joke. i don't feel any sense of accomplishment being called 'the best'. (my workshop score is currently around 20,000 and the second place is around 3,000. i almost feel bad for them.)

3. play and date
i haven't dated anyone yet since a certain someone only becomes available very late into the game, so i've only been hanging out with characters as friends so far. i noticed that characters now have multiple possible responses to each dialogue option so it's more worthwhile to chat with them multiple times. however, the activities available aren't that much of an improvement compared to portia imo. there are a few different mini-games, and that's it. it's basically the same formula. i was hoping that they could've made the dates less awkward  but perhaps romantic dates are better? oh well, i guess i'll find out soon. i know that with so many dateable characters in game it would be quite difficult to make the socializing aspect of the game more engaging, but still, no improvement or whatsoever is kind of a let down.",2579
2023-11-14,"i really love this game.

i actually appreciate the mp coop is different and a bit less ""story"" than single player -- its nice to log in with the mates and just go to town (hah) making the numbers go up. i can see a lot more development on the coop side happening too.

combat is not the greatest but it is serviceable and vastly better than portia -- i appreciate how far this team has come.",12878
2023-11-14,"if you liked my time at portia, this game is exactly like it but just everything better and bigger.
i love portia and overall crafting games and this one is really one of the best the last years, the whole workshop feels great, the characters are great, the romance stuff feels great and making money feels good in it.

it hast like a 70-120 hour story depending on your speed that feels engaging and fun, thats one thing i miss from the most ""cozy"" games, but here you get a good story and world building.

graphics and performance is now great in full release, i play on my pc with everything on ultra and no problems 100+ fps and i play on the steamdeck with mid to high settings and getting my mostly stable 40 fps.

so if you wan't a cozy game where you can really put time into, character building, story, good gameplay this game is just for you. if you are already a portia fan there is 0 reason to not get it.

the only thing that really is worse is fishing... i love fishing in games like this but how fishing is in this game its kinda useless and not good. besides that its easily one of the best cozy crafting games the last years",12878

2023-11-14,"let's just get the important bit out of the way first: this is my 2023 game of the year. it was only a matter of when the game would come out of early access to claim its crown.

now then, on to why this game is, as of this writing, my 6th most-played title in terms of hours on my steam account.

it's basically everything from my time at portia, but improved upon and made better in every possible way. the world is bigger, the building mechanics refined to a visible-from-space shine, the action rpg story fleshed out in a way that makes it the primary driver of gameplay rather than purely a framing device.

indeed, this is less a cozy game with action-rpg elements and more a reimagining of the action rpg formula where cozy game mechanics are the primary driver of progression. the genres blend seamlessly in a way that they never have before—looking at you, horizon zero dawn and forbidden west and every ubisoft game, where the crafting is tedious and feels unnecessary.

but at the same time, this game also has a cozy soul. if you're played any harvest moon-like, the life sim elements are exactly what you want them to be and then some. building relationships with villagers, romance, family life, it's all there with plenty of choices and some remarkably well-written relationship and character backstory dialogue. there are just so many ways to get a villager's friendship up compared to, say, stardew valley's more traditional talk-and-gift approach, and with the anti-frustration feature of not having to talk to every villager every day just to keep their relationship level from backsliding.

speaking of anti-frustration features, there are plenty more in this game as well. none of the main story quests are timed; complete them at your leisure. get overleveled if the combat's not your strong suit. rush the main story quests to unlock more of the crafting recipes if that's your jam. speedrunners and challenge runners? go to town, the game's got plenty of measurable ways to keep score. 

almost none of the sidequests are timed. if you unlock them too fast, as happens when you're powering through the main quest and hitting every character's sidequest trigger faster than you can bang them out, well, take a step back and take your time. the devs listened to players during the early access stage of the process and took the most common frustration—players felt rushed—out of the game. you want to complete them as fast as possible, nothing's stopping you. but it all fits in with the overarching theme of well-camouflaged accessibility that never feels like it's being dumbed down.

as for the action and combat in the action rpg, well, the devs know they're not from software. this isn't going to challenge anyone with a firm grounding in action games. you can overpower just about anything in the game because the devs have consciously avoided the bethesda syndrome of level-scaling enemies. well, with one exception—going too far afield in a sandstorm is going to surprise you the first time you run into high-level versions of basic enemies—but even that is a smart stylistic choice that makes sandstorms feel appropriately dangerous and threatening for a game set against the backdrop of a desert environment with a strong ""green aesop"" running through the main story.

is the game perfect? well, no, no game is perfect, not even games that are otherwise among the greatest of all time (i say this as someone who loved everything about red dead redemption 2 except for the on-rails quest design, for example.)

for one thing, the fishing minigame is one of the weakest i've seen in this genre. it's simplistic and repetitive and offers almost no challenge and very little reason to even engage with it beyond a couple of cooking recipes. this is a shame, especially since portia's fishing minigame was quite fun and other games like stardew, animal crossing (and dinkum, which cribs heavily from it), and even red dead 2 have great outdoorsman-style fishing gameplay.

in addition, there are a couple of dungeons in the midgame that have a jarring tonal shift toward platformer gameplay. thankfully the devs refined it a bit after its initial introduction; jumps are more forgiving, there's plenty of ""coyote time"" with ledges, and there's the option to skip the trickiest segments if you fail them enough times, but for a game that otherwise has good dungeon design, there's a heavy ""why, devs?"" when playing the two dungeons in question.

but those are minor quibbles in a game that is otherwise the absolute apex of the cozy game genre with one heck of a story rpg to go with it.

absolutely, by miles, my 2023 game of the year. 10/10.",12878

2023-11-14,"pretty full synopsis, no spoilers... except for the stupid actor part... which doesn't really spoil anything... it's the equivalent of saying, ""guy walks outside"" oh my gosh... he really did walk outside! spoilersss. i'm confident it wouldn't be the thing that kept me out of heaven by saying no spoilers...

if you liked my time at portia, you'll like this one. the controls are  basically the same with some minor differences that take getting used to. key difference i find amazing is that your storage is linked to your inventory when building, as well as most cases when giving gifts or completing quests. i found one instance where i couldn't give something in my storage and it's probably a bug. if a developer ever reads this, it was when one of the npc's was craving a ""copper plate"" i had to have it physically on me to give in that case... or maybe i'm dumb and haven't realized that all gifts must be in inventory to give and that's just a feature. in other words you don't need to spend hours organizing your storage... just throw it in and call it a day (except for clothes you want to keep... that's worth putting in it's own storage... everything else? who cares?)

relic hunting... is more exciting... maybe some won't like the change but i especially love it. instead of a giant cube room it's multiple floors of some building or something, and there are specific items you can get per floor. it makes it less of a ""find one of 50 relics which each have 2-7 pieces in this one giant room! didn't find them? well then do it all over again!"" now it's more like 5 relics per floor in a designed building that has multiple floors and start from whichever floor you want so long as you've gone deep enough to find the entrance to that floor. huge improvement in my book.

combat... i can't say about all the weapons... i started with the daggers tried, the others once, i love the daggers.... call me thorfin. 

combat is pretty similar to the old game, but just better. from armor breaking/staggering, to varying stats on the same item because of it's quality, which can range from low, to perfect, and then there's rare, which adds some cool features.... whether it's crafting, buying or finding. the items are all much more exciting in this game.

i was disappointed.... that everything feels mostly the same as the original game, but happy it's better. you're basically getting the same game but part two. 

the dialogue is mostly skipable, with the occasional choose your response, in which cases i regret not reading the dialogue... buuuut 95% of the time... totally skipable. unless i'm in a reading mood, i find it average, and occasionally good.

cut scenes.... are extremely lacking... it's like a low quality first time actor playing a major roll in a lead film, and the director says after each scene, ""cut.. that's a wrap... send it to production."" when they should've said, ""cut! that sucks! what are you doing! you're entering a scene where all the monsters are already gone, you've just barely shown up, and then you do a front roll into the room... from the middle of the room... you then aim your pistol, stand up, smile doing a finger spin with the pistol... catch it, blow the smoke off the tip of the pistol, when there is no smoke, because you haven't fired a single shot?... are you stupid? did you take acting lessons from stupid school? did you graduate top of your stupid class with stupid honors? because that was pretty stupid!""

now if they added a character to come in and say those exact words to that silly dude who did all those things... then it would've been hilarious, and we all would've understood... that's the stupid guy... but no, every cut scene is pretty much like that.

i love the game... plenty to make fun of, and critique, but that doesn't stop me from loving it. leave a comment/question if you have any specific inquiries.

dlc worth it?..... you aren't missing anything by not buying any of the dlc items... sure they'll give you a nice head start, but even though i had them i found myself not using any of them because i like starting a game with nothing and then building up to something awesome. if you're the same, save yourself a few bucks, otherwise if you just want some gear for some different looks, then maybe you'll like it.

character creation.... well at least you won't look like you have down syndrome in the game... unless that's what you're going for i'm sure you can pull it off!!! there is a major improvement on the quality of character in the creation tab... but i just want more!!! 

you really don't have a lot of options, and they don't leave you thinking, ""that character i made looks so bad a!!!"" it's more of a, ""well... i guess that's as good as it gets."" i liked how mine turned out, but it took 3 hours of messing around with every possibility, starting and deleting 3 games (the character never looks exactly the same in the game play)...before i finally got to ""my guy looks really kind of okay!""

(example... i put lipstic and changed the coloring on my guy to make him look like he had actual lips... not feminine lips... just dude lips... i get into the game... feminine af! deleted, and then did the same thing except made the lipstick lighter than what looked good... in the gameplay it looked pretty good. i mean.....i'm the equivalent of brad freaking pitt in this character creation screen! i look so good! kindof... joking aside i was happy with the final result. i can't say whether it's the same for making a girl since i didn't try.)

happy building ;).",12878
2023-11-14,"4/5 a very nice game with a lot of activities.

 more or less same basic activities as in stardew valley, farming (which is not that great here), gathering, building, a bit of rpg element. lots of quests, minigames, characters. overall game offers a ton of content and places to eplore in a chill enviroment.

the only problem is that main storyline develop really slow and most of the characters side stories are boring and you always try to skip them.",12878
2023-11-14,"my time at sandrock is the most polished and streamlined game in it's genre. when you go to use a machine, the first tab that opens shows you exactly the materials you need for commissions, assemblies and side tasks. not only that, it automatically selects the quantity you'll need to complete those things. you don't need to dismount before entering a building. all available missions are conveniently displayed to you on your map and in your mission log. all inventory chests can be accessed from any chest, effectively making one massive storage split apart into smaller compartments. there's a sort all button that will automatically take your inventory items and slot them into their respective chest, assuming a copy of that item is already stored. it's amazing. the game massively reduces the amount of time spent in game menus and gets you back into the parts of the game you want to spend more time in. it will be very difficult to go back to other village life sims after having been spoiled by sandrock.",12878

you only get 1 public storage to share across everyone. you'll have space issue very early in the game. the statues and relics will eat up your inventory space.
gear progression is okay but the end-game gear are ugly. wished there were more options. lvl 50 gear is better looking than lvl 55 gear. gear stats between 45 and 55 is not a big upgrade at all. the max lvl is 60 which means you can't max all of the skill tree.
building your house is not easy when you get to the 2nd floor upgrade. the furnitures does not snap well and the camera will snap to the 1st level when you want to place your furniture in a specific spot on the 2nd floor.
they reused mobs in higher lvls.

h o w e v e r - seriously yall, some of the bugs, mistakes, glitches and quirks in this game are just so bad and look like really easy fixes. 
- tree art has meshes that don't line up where it would appear ""chopped"" at the trunk. 
- the voice acting is either fantastic, or fantastically bad. if the actors have really thick native accents, don't tell them to sound country! it doesn't work! just have them speak in their native accent, it sounds fine and doesn't break immersion in a post calamity fantasy world. 
- do one more quality pass over your writing and dialogue, possibly with a native english speaker. there's some easy mistakes in the text/speech that can cause a lot of confusion. 
- fix the pop-in of assets! even if you have to force another second of load time for the player. i've gotten stuck in things that haven't appeared yet - especially on holidays. 
- don't automatically have the player start chopping a tree that they shouldn't be chopping! i don't want to be punished in game for doing something that i didn't mean to do in the first place. 
- allow calendar reminders for npc birthdays. 
- more sandstorms! they should damage shops and buildings, allowing for the builder to take on special commissions to repair them for temporary discounts. 
- warn players further in advance that quests are going to expire... 
- not everyone should get along. perhaps consider in the future that becoming friends with some people, means making enemies of others. make the relationship meters less linear. put more hints into the game to help the player know what gifts npc's love. i don't want to have to google this stuff! 
- more quests for the animals!

2023-11-13,"it's worth the money. 6/10 rating for now

to sum it up: combat and exploration sucks, but the rest of the game is pretty good and makes up for some of it.

crafting and expanding your workshop is very fun as well as most of the campaign. relationships with the npcs is also good. the town is beautiful.

the bad part is combat, which lacks any kind of challenge and doesn't feel good. you level up your character by doing pretty much anything and this automatically increases your damage significantly. this meant that once i started the first combat oriented mission of the campaign, i was already 10 levels above the enemies and it felt very boring. aside that, i think the main issue is that combat feels very floaty and has no weight. the sound effects animations when hitting enemies are lackluster, making it feel very boring to hit enemies.

stages for exploration are very repetitive copy paste of enviroments and lack any true interesting parts or puzzles.

inventory management is also another small issue, since there's tons of different items, it gets hard to organize them all, specially playing on controller.

overall it's a pretty decent game, with much potential if they fix combat and level scaling.

2023-11-13,"this game is just ..... wow! other game developers, please take notes. this is how you make a game. its better than stardew valley. it has literally everthing.  buy this game. i swear you wont regret it. if have the money purchase it. it is worth every penny.",14098
2023-11-14,"if you love farming/building simulation games, you will most likely love this one. i have not even finished the game yet, but i wanted to post an honest and informative review while the game is at the height of attention. this is by far the #1 game in the genre for me. i normally do short and sweet reviews, but for a game like this i want to go over some of the important aspects of it that may make or break the players experience. so let me explain the good, the bad, and the ugly.

[b]the good[/b]:
-outstanding amount of content. you can see by my playtime that i have put in a significant amount of time. i have not even finished the main story yet, and i am not actually sure how close i am to the end. there is plenty of upgrades, levels, npc content, and building/farming to be done here

-you can have a farm with plants, chickens, buffalo, bunnies, and mounts

-there are about 20 or so romance-able npc's, all with their own character growth and story arcs along side the main story. some of them are very well done and interesting while others are not quite as fleshed out, but still enjoyable

-combat in the game is quick-paced hack-n-slash shoot-em-up style. there are ""dungeons"" to breeze through where you can get treasure, materials, and glory

-festivals are a lot of fun. you unlock more festivals as the game progresses and there are fun little mini games and unique events for each one of them.

-character creation is a bit similar to my time at portia and there are a lot of lore-friendly outfits and accessories you can use to personalize your builder. the hairstyles and coloring can be customized quite a bit to give you a unique look as well

-you can go on dates and hangout with the friends you meet in town, you can play mini games in an arcade and even mahjong at a later portion of the game.

-progression is slow but it feels great. every new house and machine upgrade you get feels like an achievement. you can upgrade your mounts, raise animals, have a huge farm, and it all feels earned. once you get more levels for your workshop and character and progress the main story you can automate collection of resources to help your progression quite a bit.

-the developers are awesome and are constantly replying to concerns and bug reports in the forums, as well as trying to improve the game.

[b]the bad[/b]:
-progression is slow. i know i stated this above, but people with not a lot of time on their hands may feel that they are not getting anywhere. a lot of this probably has a lot to do with how fast you decide to progress time. you can choose anywhere from 0.6x-3.0 time progression speed, and i believe that can have an impact on the pace of the game and how quickly it goes by. i like to take things slow and experience everything the game has to offer, so i have it set at 0.6.

-stamina and time can be hard to manage at first. you may feel a struggle early game trying to get the resources you need and finishing missions on time. this caveat goes away after getting some levels and experience under your belt. a lot of people feel a struggle at the beginning. taking the game slow is a good idea at the beginning until you get used to it.

-certain resources are very hard to get such as electronics, certain plants, trees, or animal resources. some of this stuff you need for progression but it is hard or impossible to automate in any way at the beginning. when you do commissions/missions for townsfolk, if you are not careful then you won't be able to complete them on time. this is why it is good to take it slow at the beginning and learn the ins-and-outs. this adds to early game struggle and gives a sense of not getting anywhere.

-some of the romance-able npc's don't really have much character development or story missions, decreasing their interesting aspect.

-the house building/decorating leaves much to be desired. it is difficult to place objects or know what objects to place in certain circumstances. the building ui is clunky and not user friendly. it can be struggle to get a look that you like. there are mismatched patterns or just plain ugly ones when making roofs or rooms. they honestly should have hired a color expert or interior decorator because some combinations of design can be atrocious. this part of the game is passable and you can get something that you are satisfied with, but it could take some workaround.

-workshop upgrades are incredibly expensive, to the point where you have to grind money for a long time to get room for all of the workshop add-ons, machines, and other goodies. it took me a good month of in game time to get an upgrade that would give me enough building space to extend my house because of how much money it was to get it. this part of the game feels a bit unbalanced, especially with how much money you will be spending elsewhere.

[b]the ugly[/b]
-this game is bethesda level buggy as of right now. i am not even remotely exaggerating. there are issues with npc's disappearing out of nowhere, floating mounts that you can't ride because they are stuck in the air, a visual bug that messes with some resource contracts, unclear missions markers or explanations etc.

-some missions have a timer on them. so you need to complete it in a certain number of days. there are several missions that you will fail for no reason at all with no in-game timer attached to them. these missions show no sign and give no hint of a fail-trigger, but if you don't do them then you will fail them at some point for what seems like no reason. i have had this happen a few times. this is usually with side missions. 

-you need to save a lot. there are some potentially game breaking bugs and missions you can screw up through no fault of your own, as stated above. it is a good idea to have several hard saves just in case something undesirable happens that messes up your progress with missions, npc's, or other aspects.

-the game does not run well sometimes. i get around ~60 fps pretty consistently, but certain areas, scenes, or events can cause huge framerate drops to as low as 15 fps, and i have had the game crash on me once. some people report even worse performance, but for me it is tolerable. i have a pretty decent gaming computer. i can run cyberpunk on max with a constant 60-70 fps, and this game performs slightly worse in certain cases. i will say that it seems they have ironed out some of this in the last week or so since my performance seems to have improved over the last couple days. in particular, when the train comes into town is one of the points where i get an fps drop to 15, but earlier today it did not drop when the train came in.

the game is by no means perfect, but it is my favorite game in the genre. if you liked portia or games like stardew valley, coral island, or any other popular sim games like this, then you will probably love this one. the developers are constantly looking at feedback and improving the game, so i am almost positive all of the negatives i pointed out will be fixed at some point in the future. they have already been actively releasing post-launch updates and they even intend to add more content eventually from what i have read. the developers and this game have my full confidence and support!

2023-11-13,"fantastic sequel to my time at portia. i was expecting a bit more of a finished product, still some bugs and rendering issues, but it has just as great as a storyline as portia.",14098
2023-11-13,"my time at sandrock has, so far, been a worthy sequel to my time at portia. if you're a fan of life-sims like harvest moon, rune factory or stardew valley, there's likely to be something here for you. 

panthea really stepped up their game on this one. actions feel so much more impactful and fluid than in portia. i have not completed the main storyline so far (77 hours in!) but i have really enjoyed how dynamic the characters and stories have been! 

i'd like to draw particular attention to the voice acting. while there are a few clunkers, no offense to them, the majority of the voice actors really hit it out of the park! similarly, the writing really rose to the occasion in this one. they'll occasionally reference memes or movies in their lines and i normally find that a little cringe but it happens sporadically enough that i find it endearing here. 

finally, if it means to anyone who has read this far, i seldomly review games here on steam. the ones i do are ones i really enjoyed! that means a whole lot right there.",14098
2023-11-13,"i love this game so much :d it surely improved a lot since my time in portia. not to mention that some event is even connected to the previous game, like how ginger leave portia to head to sandrock to be cured, and sandrock is not the only place invaded by the duvos'. there are many majors coming from different places which i believe may be the place for the next game in the seri my time at :3 my guess is ethea since it got mention many times, and seem to face the similar issues like sandrock, so i think there is a chance.
i also love the romancing stuff, there are events to upgrade relationship without giving them the necessary item, except for the proposing, of course. i just enjoying those dialogue and the cut scene.",14098
2023-11-13,"in the last week i've played this game for 80 hours. so i like it. just a a little.
my sister bought me this since she'd played the beta. normally i'm not the most excited to play life sims with farming in it because the market is oversaturated with samey, boring games that wish they could be like stardew valley.
instead, i got a game where i don't have to farm if i don't want to (except for some quests but. no daily watering anyway, so that's dope). the story itself has been super enjoyable, and fun. i didn't think it'd ramp up like it did, but serious, emotional moments would pop up out of nowhere, and it felt like such a treat. i can do basically anything, and at my own pace. there's very little the game stopped me from doing that wasn't story related. it's fun to have all the options in the world, and have none of them be a bad on.
sandrock has easily become one of my favorite games, and i hope there's more like it and portia in the future.",14098
2023-11-13,"i absolutely adore this game. i played the one before it, my time at portia and fell in love with that slice of life game, but this one has definitely took my number one spot.

the game is a blast, there's ruin diving, farming, workshop building, you can build your own house, can build a stable for your mounts, a barn for your farm animals, etc.

i haven't had a game give me such a breath of fresh air in a minute, and this one has been an absolute treat getting into. the character dialogue, relationships and backstories of all characters are so much improved than in my time at portia, it really feels like the devs not only built upon their previous title but still kept their heart on their sleeves while making this one. i'm currently 50 hours into a new game with no sign of finishing anywhere near soon, as i love to take everything slow and explore to my hearts content. now, there is some jank, it feels like the combat, while improved from my time at portia still plays fast and loose. sometimes it feels a little too spammy and other time it feels like you have a bullet sponge boss. also, my lock on is a bit fickle to say the least. but for any jank i mentioned there's a labor of love behind all of it.

i cannot wait for what the pathea game developers work on in the future with sandrock and other titles, they have definitely made me a fan of their work(s)!

",14098
2023-11-12,"i played my time at portia before this and loved it. initially when sandrock was announced, i wasn't excited about playing in the desert. i decided to give it a go anyway because of how much i loved portia. to my surprise, my time at sandrock far surpasses my time at portia. from the story depth, backgrounds of every character, storage, ruin diving, map size, amount of quests, the existence of logan, voice acting, graphics of course and just overall day to day. there is always something to do in sandrock. just for reference, i put 146 hours into my time at portia. i've played 253 hours of my time at sandrock, i'm almost finished with the main story and plan on replaying just to explore all the marriage candidates. 

kudos to the devs for creating such a story rich, beautiful game. they are also amazing at fixing bugs. i spent half of my time playing before full release and picked it back up once it was fully released. it's abundantly clear they care about this game and the players. i can not wait to see what they have in store for us in the future with project me!!!",18838
2023-11-12,"overall good game. its odd when i hit rock and the ore floats above it, making it difficult to hit and pinpoint with my pickax in the mines at time. the cut scenes can also take an awkward moment to start as the npc sometimes walks around a bit. 
other than small odd things, the game runs great and is very immersive. the characters are all wonderful and i'm obsessed with all of the romance options. improved a lot from my time at portia as well, the grinding feels less grindy.",18838
2023-11-11,"this game is so much fun  - it looks cute and it has a lot of heart. the unique desert setting allows for gameplay that differs a little from the classic farming sim, and you can tell the developers have put a lot of thought into it (e.g., what would farming look like in the desert?). the storyline is interesting with a bit of mystery, the characters are enjoyable, and combat is fun. overall, this game is an improvement on my time at portia - which was also great - with a world that players can go to relax and have fun.",18231

2023-11-05,it has sand and rocks.....good god there is so much sand and rocks.,19735
2023-11-12,"i recommend it but it has a lot of flaws.
clunky cinematics, npc teleporting themselves out of scenery. after 50 hours playtime the game started lagging, the time was slowed and every animation was delayed and 5/6/7 seconds longer than usual. very put me out of it when it happen unfortunately. (restarting the game doesn't really work, skipping day or sometime going in and out of an interior can work)

the storyline is.. surprising for this type of game but cool overall. the 2/3rd of the game was pretty smooth with quest almost everyday guiding you and providing you goals to go forward. 
when you've done almost all side content, the game consist of sleeping to trigger main events. (after 70h+ for me.) so i'm starting to get tired of it even tho' i have still a few things to do.

the game can be really immersive if you're into this kind of game. socializing and housing is nice. 
still wasn't able to romance the character of my choice after 120h playtime. i don't know why but the person was constantly refusing the necklace even tho the npc is indicated as a possible bachelor. since the character is used in main story, maybe it'll change in a few in-game days. 
i played a few of portia but here i felt more guided (in a good way). main mission in portia was like : firstly build a bus stop, then go upgrade all your workshop and tools then go build the bridge. 
here it's more build this, then this but it need a new ressource that you can find here, and that allows you to start upgrading gears and workshop without it to be instantly needed to continue. making you feel like you're the one choosing to upgrade stuff to go faster, provide new things etc.

i backed the game and played a few during alphas and betas so i'm a little disappointed to feel like the game is unpolished at this state.

i don't know if i'll come back to this game but still, it kept me busy for 125hours so it made its part of entertaining me.",18838
2023-11-12,i thought i had found a 3d version of stardew valley - this is not it. it feels more like a sophisticated phone game. it's not bad though if that's what you're into,18838
2023-11-12,"in other farming games, i worry about progressing through the quests too fast. in this game, as in my time at portia before it, i know the quests will just keep coming and coming and coming. so much content, funny characters, and a serious upgrade to the inventory system that makes everything more convenient. 

what elevates this series above others for me is gradually being able to see the huge changes you make to the land and town. see that bridge/tower/mill etc.? i built that! i fixed that problem, and now i see it every time i ride past.",18838

2023-11-12,"i honestly love this game. i really enjoyed my time at portia, but i feel that my time at sandrock amplified all the good things and built a rock solid game. i feel that the story progression is very fluid and i never feel like i have too much down time. the townsfolk have a lot of personality, the quests are engaging, and i feel like the mining system is more enjoyable. i haven't participated in the multiplayer option yet, but i don't think that they should deter you from playing the game on your own since there is so much to do in the single player mode!",18838

2023-11-12,"*multiplayer review*

i only played a small amount of the single player version before jumping into multiplayer with my wife.  the big difference i noticed right off was that you have to build & populate the town in multiplayer while most of the towns buildings & populous are already there in single.

while it's a really fun game in multiplayer, it is very much a grind.  it took the 2 of us around 60 hours to get every building built & upgraded so if you find grind tedious, this might not be the game for you.  i found the grind tolerable because it's mixed in with other content such as dungeons, farming, caring for pets & mounts, crafting, exploring, events, house/workshop building and story line.  the best feature of multiplayer is that when you set up a multiplayer game, it's just like renting your own server except it costs you nothing.  you can have the game match you with other players or start a new town and chose to let randoms in or set it to invite only.  when you have players join, unlike many other game, you do not have to be online for them to log in and play.  for the amount of play time and content you'll get out of this game, i think the price tag is a fare price but that will be up to you to determine.  if you don't mine the grind, i recommend this game so watch some gameplay or trailers and see if it's for you.",18838
2023-11-12,"i haven't played my time at portia, but i love this game. the grind sets in fairly early but if you like looter/crafting/grinding then this game is for you.

would love to see a co-op single player added, this game really needs it.",18838

2023-11-12,"top tier cozy game! my time at sandrock, like portia before it, stands out from the classic farming games like harvest moon and stardew valley with interesting mechanics and lots and lots to do! they did a great job making the desert locale make sense and fit the new recycling mechanic and it looks and plays a lot cleaner than portia!",18838

2023-11-12,"for the first few hours i was kind of iffy on this game. i love the stardew genre of games though and the initial grid didn't deter me. i'm now 78 hours in and i can safely say this game is an absolute gem. it has everything you'd expect in a game like this, tool progression, a passable combat system, a modest tech tree and progressive efficiency gains, but there are a few things that put it above the rest of the competition within this genre.

1. inventory management is an absolute breeze. when crafting and turning in quests you have access to every item in every chest that you own. furthermore, when you go to any chest in your base to deposit items after a day of gathering, you can press a single button to automatically deposit all like-items into stacks across all of your chests. this game has completely solved the inventory management issue that bogs down mid and late-game in this genre and for that i tip my hat.

2. the writing in this game is phenomenal! the story is pretty bonkers and while being pretty cutesy and family friendly, crams in a lot of humor and some genuinely wild twists and turns. this game isn't high-drama, but it's just so much fun that i can't recommend it enough. the characters are also very well-written and unique.

3. the art design for this game is very unique and i think it'll age fairly well. the customization options you get on your character are pretty fun. i like seeing what other people made their avatars to look like. you also get an outfit tab separate from your equipment tab so you have total freedom to customize your look.

so all that said, there are a few cons that whittle this game down from being perfect to being in the 9/10 bracket.

1. the map is fairly limited in size. you'll spend a lot of time going back and forth through the same areas for dozens of hours.

2. the game is pretty grindy if you're looking to upgrade your farm to the largest possible size. it requires an absolutely diabolical amount of money and there aren't a lot of ways to make said money as easily as you can in stardew valley. there's a barn and coop structure that you can build, but they aren't very good revenue sources; the same can be said about farming. the real way to make money in this game is to fulfill a limited amount of crafting requests each day and then just grind the mines over and over. i wish there were more options for money making or that the farm plot upgrades were cheaper.

overall i really like this game and recommend it strongly if you're a fan of this genre. grit your teeth through the slow start and then enjoy yourself for literal days.",18838
2023-11-12,the game is fun and has a good flow to it. love that you can fight in the open world and not just only in caves. you do have to grind for what you what but that's that point of this kind of game. the only thing that i would change about the game is to make it to where you have to craft a bigger bag rather then pay for one extra slot at a time but. but still 10 out of 10.,18838
2023-11-12,"my time at sandrock is an amazing sequel to my time at portia. it improves on most parts while only keeping a few weaknesses it's predecessor had. to keep it short:

+runs better
+no more inventory management (your machines automatically use items from your chests, and you can scroll through all chests at once), but it still keeps the inventory when gifting items/donating to the museum (why though? please fix this)
+an interesting story (it's nothing groundbreaking, but it keeps you hooked), however the story has 2 plotlines and the 2nd one keeps dragging on for just a bit too long imo (if the pacing was improved, a solid 10 hours of gametime could be cut, which would fix this imo)
+improved overall gameplay (combat is better, mines are now actually designed instead of randomly generated, big enemy variety, several weapon options)
+better cast (i disliked it more in the first few hours, but the more time i put into it, the more i grew to prefer it over the first cast), additionally, the game doesnt shy from adding or taking away characters halfway through the story, keeping the cast fresh
+improved farming, improved pet keeping, improved mount-system and unlockable options to modify your house and workshop from home (no more running to the upgrade-store)

~new building system for housing. originally i liked it a lot, but its very shallow. the lack of options to build as well as the lack of forms for building really put a dent into this for me (no triangles, round houses etc.) and the factory and greenhouse also got worked into this and are now basically quadratic blocks with little to no customization, so they look worse like the old versions but also dont improve on them gameplaywise.
~bigger focus on socializing - the game has a lot of small quests which tell you stories about the individual characters, their relationships with each others and their backstories. i put it in mixed because some people prefer the core gameplay loop, but if you enjoy the social-part, this puts games like sdv in the dust
~bigger focus on combat and platforming - i mentioned earlier that sandrock improved on combat. however, it's still not good. you can work with it, it does what it has to do, but thats it. and focusing a big part of the story on the workable combat and clunky platforming simply doesnt work and is frustrating. personally, those were the most dreadful parts, despite the devs working some of the best ideas into them.

-all those nitpicks i had lead to me feeling like the game was simply not quite finished. it reminded me a lot of baldurs gate 3, where the start was so well thought through and everything worked perfectly but as you got into the later parts of the game it starts to feel as if they didnt work it through enough.
-same goes for performance. the game runs overall a lot better than portia, but as you get into the later parts of the game, you get more bugs, such as textures not loading, small lagspikes and characters not working or completely disappearing.

overall i give sandrock a 7/10. if they fix the bugs and improve on the factory and greenhouse the game can easily become an 8-9/10 and one of the strongest condenders in the genre, next to stardew valley.",18838
2023-11-12,"highly recommend, this game rivals my all time favorite stardew valley. similar mechanics and foundation to my time at portia, but vastly improved graphics and play-ability. i have found all the characters interesting and fun to talk to, missions engaging and thoughtful, and gameplay smooth and cohesive.

i've had this game since christmas last year (so most of my hours were in early access) and the game has only been improved with full release. when i came across a game breaking bug in the afternoon, it was fixed by the next morning. pathea has outdone themselves. i have something like 280 hours played (230 hours on my main file) and am close to completing the main story, but not quite there yet.

i love time sink games like this and the only con i can think of is that sometimes it takes a while to load a new area (exiting the house, going into a dungeon, etc). my understanding is this is going to be further optimized in the future so i have no complaints about this game and can't wait to spend many more hours on it! 10/10 with lots of love",18838

[h3] okay, so i have obviously played this game a lot, and it's because it is that good! if you're a return player from portia, i can confirm to you that sandrock is a massive upgrade in almost all aspects! if you have never played a game in the my time at series, don't worry! you absolutely do not have to play portia to enjoy sandrock! after over 200 hours of game play, here's my major takeaways ~ [/h3]

[u] the great ~ [/u] 

[b] the story line [/b]
- sandrock has a really great main story quest line, with enough twist and turns to keep you interested and immersed. it truly was a pleasure to play through it! there's a good mix of resource gathering, social aspects, combat, farming, and advancement required that keeps you motivated to continue grinding towards completion. also, if you're a return player from portia, i personally believe that sandrock has a better story line, and has increased difficulty.
[b] the characters [/b]
- wow! sandrock truly has some very colorful characters! without giving anything away, these side characters have a variety of personalities that are genuinely fun to interact with. in a lot of other games from this genre i tend to stop talking to a lot of the npcs around town, but i actually like hearing what the characters in sandrock have to say! it also helps that every character is given new unique dialogue after progress in the story is made, so they're not just constantly spouting the same lines all the time, regardless of development. there's a lot of great romance options as well, with there being someone for everyone. 
[b] the dialogue [/b]
- there's no other way to say this ~ this game just has straight up hilarious lines! from a farmer who's a part-time conspiracy theorist to a rock obsessed wannabe deputy, there's no shortage of great lines from the characters around the game. the dialogue also makes you want to befriend more of the citizens to see their extra events because of how hilarious they can be. your player character can even give some golden one-liners as the game progresses! 
[b] the grind [/b] 
- you really have to get involved in all aspects of the game when playing. you're going to need a lot of wood to complete projects, i mean, you are a builder. however, sandrock is desolate and cutting down trees and cacti is a big no-no. this means you have to cut down tiny bushes, dead logs, etc. which do not give you a lot of resources, meaning you've got to keep at the grind! also, as you unlock more areas and more of the story, you find yourself having to go back to previous ruins/areas in order to get different types of materials, as they're not in the same place. don't forget that water powers all of your machines, so you have to keep your tank full in the middle of the desert! 

[u] the lacking~ [/u]

[b] the family issue [/b]
- in short, because there's so many elements in sandrock, they eventually fizzle out in unsatisfactory ways. a good example can be seen with married and family life, which is just not fleshed out enough. considering characters around the game continuously sing praises towards your character, and comment on the various things going on around, it's strange that basically nobody acknowledges your spouse and children. so far, there's no family events, and once your children exit the baby stage, you literally never see them interact with anyone, including your spouse. they wake up and essentially go to one place (the train station) for the entire day.  it would've been nice to have them as actual members of the town, with their own events as they age, and a routine that mimics other npcs. as for your spouse, the married events currently in game are very boring and out of place for some characters. i would really love to see married life and family life be more fleshed out in the future, whether in another my time game, or in an expansion/update! i would rather have less romance options and just one child if that means that the additional content that comes with them would be stronger. 
[b] character favoritism + strange depth [/b]
- it's very obvious that, because of fan reception, some characters are more favored than others. by this i mean that they have way more content. take fang and logan as an example. both characters are fan favorites, and they have some really cool events! these events also work really well with what has been presented with their characters, which gives not only their characters, but the game, more depth. it really makes you believe that they had a life before you, and have a life despite you. i suppose this makes me more critical of the other characters in the game. director qi is a good example of this. you actually get to know so much about his character! for example, he's the grandson of a successful scientist who appears to be very strict, his parent's had more ""lowly"" jobs in comparison and qi appears to sort of look down on them, and he even states that his parents were shocked to find out that you exist (if you romance him), and that when he was younger he calculated that there was only a 3.14% chance of him finding love. these all combine to create such an interesting character, and gives you a plethora of ideas of how his character will/can progress. however, despite these tidbits that you can gather, that's basically it. his character, as well as a large portion of characters in the game, plateau. this is what i mean about strange depth, it's like they had more planned for certain characters, and it just never came to fruition. i was so certain when romancing qi's character that there was going to be some really cool events regarding his past, him falling in love with you, having children of his own, etc., and it just never happened. it honestly was a big disappointment because i saw all the makings of a great side story for a lot of the romance-able characters, but it's just not there. 

[h3] in conclusion, i honestly feel like i have so much more to say, which isn't surprising considering how much i loved the game. additionally, i would say that because i love the game and series so much i am probably more critical of it in certain ways! i think that's truly the hallmark sign of a great game, liking it so much that you want to make certain changes to perfect it! all in all, sandrock was truly an amazing experience and i would recommend it to all lovers of the genre. however, keep in mind that there are going to be aspects of the game that will leave you frustrated. these frustrations, at least for me, have a lot to do with the fact that i just want more! keep it up devs! you're doing great sweeties, and the improvement from portia is massive!

2023-11-11,"the multiplayer isnt on par with the singleplayer yet, but a friend and i still got 48 hours of gameplay out of it and we will return when more content is added",18231
2023-11-11,"yeah, it's fun.",18231
2023-11-11,"overall, i recommend the game - 480 hours played across early release - but that doesn't mean the game is perfect. much has been made of the voiceover issues with this game, so i'll bypass those, other than to add that changing the voiceover artist for later updates compounded the issue.

it's less clunky (although arguable less realistic, as a consequence) than its predecessor, my time at portia, which may make for a less than satisfying experience for anyone who chooses to play that game after this one. the characters in sandrock are less bobble-headed, too, which is an improvement. portia and sandrock happen in a simultaneous timelime, which leads to some quietly-amusing references to, effectively, your portia character at points during sandrock, another reason to consider playing portia first.

of the five bachelors i romanced, three of them exhibited behaviour that, in real life, should set major alarm bells ringing, which is quite concerning. a couple of the npcs are genuinely unlikeable, which is fine and reflective of real life; but i found myself resenting completing lucrative contracts for one of them by late game, as their relationship with me continued to increase even as my loathing of them grew.

as i did play this through early release, some things may have changed by full release, but a few niggly annoyances stood out: at times, lucrative commissions for machinery would appear on the commission board; but without having any in-game ability to know what was required to complete construction, it was quite frustrating to accept these commissions, research the manufacturing plans, discover you needed more advanced equipment yourself, research that, then find that you needed components you either didn't have materials for, or didn't have the ability to make. in one instance, the 'base' instructions for making the refined material i needed to make one component didn't even become available until nearly two months after i'd failed the commission. if the capacity to complete the commission doesn't exist, don't make it available.

secondly, there were times when it became impossible to complete tasks because the final act clashed with some other event. some of these may have since been resolved. in a related annoyance, there are times when the pc wakes up with awareness of events it is literally impossible for them to have any knowledge of. often this is minor: calendar events added on rising in the morning that are explained when mail is read. occasionally, however, these are quite significant. just as bed, there are some events involving npcs that clearly acknowledge the passage of a significant period of time (a minimum two weeks would be essential in one case), yet those events conclude within a day or so. then there is the issue of being 'transported' to major events when you get up. on one occasion, running back home after such an event, i encountered a minor task simply by talking with an npc that i had no means of answering because the task was outlined in a letter i hadn't yet had a chance to read. more concerningly, the non-committal answer i gave may have broken the character, who never moved from the spot i encountered him for the remainder of the game, unless needed elsewhere.

the nanny-nag that says ""you can't use that possibly rude word!"" when naming things in single-player is both ludicrous and offensive: i'm an adult, not six years old, and i can make my own decisions. if it's important that any vaguely-implied rudeness must be leapt on with extreme prejudice, then i would suggest that eliminating toxic behaviours from a multitude of npcs would be a better use of censorship - especially if (and i am forced to assume that this must be the case) the game makers are trying to avoid corrupting sweet childish innocence.

similarly, an in-game swimwear fashion show basically designed to sell dlcs is both sexist and cowardly in dressing the female models in bikins and the males in shorts. the game designers may have jumped on the 'it's okay to be gay"" bandwagon; but their moral code is severely lacking in other areas (most particularly regarding toxic behaviours).

one in-game shop has a link to actual character figurines on amazon: if you follow the link you find that you're being asked to pay an offensively-large amount of money for a blind-box figurine, so that's a definitive 'no' on both counts. still, that annoyance is easily-avoided, although it does make me less-inclined to consider buying other pathea games products, up to and including dlcs, so they may like to rethink their approach.

yes, i have concentrated on the negatives in this review. on the positive side, the game is immensely-playable. for an obsessive such as me, there is always something to do, with the essential wait-times scattered throughout the game usually not too much of a trial. some npcs are clearly on the autism spectrum, and this is treated respectfully (albeit occasionally with not-unreasonable impatience) by other npcs and player choices, which is to be commended. apart from some built-in sexism, the character design is generally appealing, and the capacity to 'hide the hat' via the settings is appreciated: having put a lot of effort into designing my character, i like being able to see them. the storylines are often engaging, although i wish the character-based relationship-building tasks had a time expiry if unselected, because having them sit constantly on the map when i have no interest in following them through is annoying.

in summary, an enjoyable, very playable game with a number of flaws, some of them significant.",18231

2023-11-11,"do not buy, extremely buggy game.

i really enjoyed my time at portia (mtap), and found that sandrock (mtas) has extended much of the gameplay. the interaction system is fine, and the crafting system is basically identical. most of the game is good (hence my recent post-release play of ~90 hours (~20hrs was during the beta)). the fishing is so much better in mtas, it's a great improvement.

however, as the game goes on, more and more bugs arise. i've found that the game starts to chug after long play sessions (5+hrs) and needs to be restarted just to transition between scenes more smoothly. i've had several days where the game just hangs because when you leave your house in the morning it's supposed to cut to a cutscene, but the cutscene doesn't start, and so the game just sits on a black screen. sometimes restarting the game helped, otherwise i had to restart my computer (this indicates that mtas isn't releasing resources it finished using).

on the non-bugs front: the dialogue is often just bad. while i don't mean characters like unsuur who are just intentionally odd (and pretty funny), the entire bronco the kid arc is just immensely painful to play through. i appreciate that this was probably attempting to be silly, it's just a conversation that actual humans would never have with each other.

there are a lot of ""popins"" = graphics that just 'pop' into existence, but should have been there beforehand. exiting a building (eg the museum) leaves you standing outside an empty lot until the game loads in the building. this is not a modern fps, a quick look at the sceenshots will quickly show that the graphics in this game are very basic, no dlss in sight. yet buildings (and people) are often loaded in very slowly, taking 2-3 seconds to fully load each time you fast travel. this seems small until you realise that you will be fast travelling multiple times per day, every day, so this issue is constantly in your face.

npcs don't exist in the world. or rather, they do until they need to be somewhere else, and then they teleport. one of the things that i enjoyed in mtap was watching the townsfolk sprint across town to get to a gathering. in addition to being fun to watch, it also meant you could intercept them during their schedule to interact with them. this largely doesn't happen any more, they're simply teleported to where they need to be. this, frankly, is just absolute garbage, and leads to a bunch of issues.

an example: heidi and i are married in the game, and i have a quest to give her an item. according to my map, she's at the game centre, so i hop on my horse and head over there. as i approach the games centre, the quest marker jumps back to my workshop: she's there to pick up all the completed items from my machine. so i turnaround and head back to my workshop. as i pass the train station, the quest marker jumps *back* to the game centre: heidi finished her workshop tasks, and her schedule has her at the games centre so she teleports again.

in mtap, i would have met heidi on her way, but in mtas it's impossible.

in addition to that, npcs will just randomly teleport around. if you hang around the main square in front of the town hall, justice and trudy will just randomly materialise there. this is an entirely reasonable thing to do if npcs get stuck on objects, but 1) it's happening all the goddamn time, and 2) coco gets stuck on objects in my workshop all the time, yet never teleports.

this is before we talk about a game-breaking bug that has halted my current play. two events were supposed to occur on two different days, but the first didn't trigger on the correct day, so now they've both blended and are happening at the same time. this has caused the game to lose its sh~t, and spin my camera out into the desert, where it just sits and ignores all input from me.

all in all, this game is riddled with bugs, and has serious foundational flaws in its design. i bought this game in early access on the strength of mtap, and (frankly) i regret doing so.

edited to respond to dev comment: it *is* installed on an ssd. you seem to be saying that it's even worse on an hdd.....",18231
2023-11-11,"this is a review on the multiplayer side of the game. i never tried the single player mode.
solid game. surprisingly large amount of content and good quality throughout. 

quest done almost always add value to your gameplay and town and not just a exp/gold farm like what quest in games usually do. grinding doesnt feel like a chore as you are rewarded well for it. as for how much things there is to do in the game, the only answer is yes. after 30hrs in, i still never run out of things to do, super addicting. 

combat is fairly simple and suit a game like this, where building and developing your town is the main goal. dungeons are pretty fun to go through, the bosses have mechanics and not just a mob with large hp pool which was surprising as well. however, most fights is just a stat fight (whether you have enough stats/heals), dodging doesnt feel that important in the game and it doesnt even feel rewarding to dodge attacks as you can just tank through everything anyways with enough stats and heals and kill the mob faster. however, it is understandable as it is a rather casual friendly game. however if the devs decide to make the combat more interactive rather than a stat fight in the future, i am all for it. also guns are fun and all, needing to use ads to shoot is not fantastic.

last and the biggest selling point for me, dedicated servers. it makes it easy to have friends play in the same town anytime as everyone has their own lifes and can play at different timings. unlike many of the sandbox games that only supports p2p as default.",18231

2023-11-11,"having played portia, and having played this a bit while in ea, i can definitively say that this is a straight upgrade in many ways compared to the previous game and that time spent in ea was well spent to make a generally well-polished experience on release. 

the thing that stood out to me as vastly improved in comparison to portia is the combat, which, for a game that has utilized this mechanic in a more intimate way that other farming/building/life simulation games, i think really nails the good balance in necessity to being enjoyable to engage with. especially when you start upgrading the combat skills, getting more combos, getting the flow of the enemy actions and dodging and timing strikes, while not particularly profound, still feels enjoyable and far more engaging than the previous games and others in the same genre i've experienced. it feels simple enough though that even if you're not really playing this game to partake in the combat-portion of the game, it's easy enough to out-level the enemies by performing other tasks that simple button mashing to get the mats you need from lower level monsters won't pose much of an obstacle.

outside of combat, i've always enjoyed the commission system in both games, and i think it serves well here for giving yourself a sense of progression and direction. while being rewarding enough that, while being somewhat repetitive in what you'll be building for the various residents of sandrock, serves more as the foundation for pursuing other enjoyable ventures like upgrading your workshop, buying mats that you need either directly at stores or commissioning deliveries while giving you enough of a reward in not only the money you need, but additional materials and easy relationship improvements outside of the, arguably, rather shallow and repetitive npc conversational engagements quickly enough to give you variety in other things to do without feeling like too much of a grind.

the story is also rather cute, if not a bit on the simple side, which imo, is fine for what it is - it gives you a further sense of purpose and a meaningful way to progress unlockable areas, residents, and mechanics. i feel several of the npcs have notable quirks that make them memorable enough to want to engage with them and their missions, although at times, even with the characters that are not designed to be long-winded (like cooper), i found myself wanting to read the dialog faster than i wanted to hear it from them because there's just something about the way they talk and the flow that just made me frequently want to skip it. can't really put my finger on why exactly, but this was especially true when interacting with them daily during the regular chat interactions. with that said though, one really nice touch is how npcs all have their own individual reactions to story events that are enjoyable to listen to, even if they can be a bit long-winded sometimes. it's a nice touch to detail that somewhat makes your accomplishments in the game feel more relevant to your place in the world.

lastly, while i haven't played much of it since ea, the multiplayer seems way more polished (and was non-existent in the previous game) and has been pretty fun so far. if you've got friends to play with, while it's completely separate from the base instance of the game, the co-op workspace and co-op commissions and being able to engage in spelunking and combat with friends gives it a fresh feel from the base, single-player, portion of the game.

[h3][u]tl:dr[/u][/h3]
- solid improvement from the previous game in almost every way.
- combat improvements especially feel much better from previous games.
- story is fine, albeit a bit on the simple side. more focus made on the mechanics.
- many npcs are memorable in their own way if not a bit long-winded and the base chat mechanic is a bit bleh but the ""play"" mechanics make up for it a bit (albeit, get a bit repetitive with the limited options and expensive energy costs to engage in them). 
- multiplayer is a separate instance from the base, single-player, game, but having all the same mechanics being applied while playing with friends has, so far, been a very enjoyable experience and is way more polished than when it was introduced in ea.",18231
2023-11-11,"while i'm having a great time with it, and in many ways it's an upgrade over portia, i cannot in good conscience reccommend the game in it's current state. 

bugs, technical issues and performance issues are everywhere, despite claiming to be a full release after an early access period. 

teleporting / weirdly moving characters, duplicating items, invisible walls with no explanation, non functional area transitions, extremely slow asset loading (why does a game with <5% of the complexity have massive pop in issues compared to something like cyberpunk on a good ssd?), overlapping timed events, tooltips that are straight up wrong (why does upgrading my crafting table to level 3 say i'm going to unlock copper pots when i've been able to make those all along?), events on a fixed time line happening out of order, items you're meant to interact with going invisible, quests referencing things you haven't unlocked yet, weapons being extremely poorly balanced, crafting system loosing track of what you need to make and when (the quick crafting option would be great if it didn't bug out 90% of the time by telling you to make parts for things you already have)... i could go on.

despite the ea period, the game seems to have no meaningful qa testing whatsoever, as most issues i've found would've been obvious to anyone playing for a few hours.

there is a good game under all the issues, but again, i can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone until most of these (really basic) problems are fixed.",18231
2023-11-10,"i'll come back later once i have the words to explain every thing but for now
 
this game is amazing, a little rough around the edges but leagues better than portia. like, scary how much better it is than portia!
and i dare say even, this even manage to surpass stardew valley in my heart. all the story stuff, the characters, the romance. its just so fun, it's so cozy. 

this game makes me very happy",15092
2023-11-10,"if you're a fan of stardew valley, harvest moon, rune factory or any of the similar games and are really wanting to find yourself a decent game, this one is pretty great. if you've play my time at portia, lemme just summarize and say that this... is a much better game than that one was. 

it does have the odd bug now and again, but the devs are actively listening to player feedback and are cranking out patches to fix as many issues as they can. currently multiplayer is having some issues and there are some performance issues at least when it comes to load times (especially cutscenes).

there's gathering, building, monster fighting (which is almost too ez at this time), pets, romance, events, characters with depth (for the most part), transmog for outfits, home decor/building and even children! theres a lot and apparently they're hinting at adding even more and/or fleshing more out. 

all of this and under $40? in this day and age? not too shabby!",15092
2023-11-11,"just as great as the original, with more depth.",18231
2023-11-11,perfect mix of animal crossing and stardew valley for a really nice comfort game to escape reality.,18231
2023-11-11,i only played portia during ea and i am glad that i waited for this one to go full release first. very nicely done and moreish. you can easily loose yourself in the daily cycle of love and money.,18231
2023-11-10,"in the beginning i could only play multiplayer (which i didn't mind) because single player had a lot of lag and long loading times but, only a week after, the issue has been fixed and i can now play the game with high graphics with no issues. seeing the difference in game play between single player and multiplayer you can tell how much thought and effort they put in on making the experience fit with each game mode. in single player you have a more personal experience with the town people and in multiplayer you have big goals and dungeons you can work towards together.",15092
2023-11-10,"unfinished, in my opinion. i would describe this as ""unity jank in perpetual early access"" 

the yawning blackness within doorways feels awkward. the music's abrupt shifts between scenes and loading screens add to the awkwardness. cut scenes feature jarring transitions. the concept of the ruins is goofy, with all the intellectual stimulation of one of those archaeology sand-treasure toys for toddlers. digging dirt towards an icon and walking through black doors, hitting buttons for more icons—repeat ad nauseam. fishing is oddly implemented. the repetitive, brown environment is a monotonous downer. two resources to manage for crafting: water and fuel. why? you don't have to do much to manage either of them so i just don't even understand why it exists other than bloat. the furniture is bulky, occupying too much space without purpose. the game lacks a clear identity, failing to embody a competent farming sim, resource management game, or social game. the kids in the game all give me the creeps.

the english localization is spotty with errors that should have been fixed long ago. in-game advertisements (with grammatical errors!!) direct to external websites, including amazon pages. they also beg for reviews via in-game advertisements. the inaccurate wiki diminishes the quality of available online information.

despite these issues, i'll persist in playing because i enjoy this genre. if i hadn't known it wasn't in early access, i would have unquestioningly believed it still was. if you have ""switch store bloatware"" standards for games, you will probably be fine with this release. i neither recommend nor advise against this game. 

it should 100% be cheaper though.

p.s. i forgot to add this stupidity: when you walk into the edge of the water, the entire screen goes black and then you reappear at the edge of the water. if you walk in a second time in the same place, your character gets teleported to the center of town. i'm guessing this is because they intended to implement swimming at some point but just couldn't figure it out and so you get teleported as a failsafe to prevent your character from getting stuck. honestly, what happened to invisible walls?",15092

2023-11-10,"this sequal to my time at portia happens to be as good as, if not better than my time at portia.
the game has tons of improvements, tons of new features and mechanics, tons of quality of life additions, and more that were not in my time at portia.
furthermore it has a much more detailed and exquisite crafting system, farming system, construction system, and combat system, all of which is easy to learn because it wasn't made very complex.
there is also tons of in game tutorials and means to look back at past information, so the player will not get lost as easily as they did in my time at portia.
this game is a massive improvement in many ways. perhaps the only complaint the player could ever have is water management, and even then, for a player that is willing to learn and understand water conservation, a player will learn how to easily manage their water reserves with time and never run out of water (which will take a long time for people who have extreme difficulty with extremely basic management skills and extremely basic learning skills).
in any case, i have been playing this game since closed beta, i was a kickstarter backer, and i think the full release is infinitely superior to the beta, and it is way better than my time at portia, though it is reasonable to understand that the water management system is treated as the reason many people say this game is worse than my time at portia... it is probably the only downside to this game.
everything else is an improvement. if you love the idea of playing a game where you live in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland and are actively working towards rebuilding civilization and restoring the environment to a pristine green condition and don't mind the occasional combat scenario this game is for you.",15092
2023-11-10,"""my time at portia"" was an apparently simple game, and yet it provided a surprisingly deep experience.
after playing for a good while, it's obvious the developers at pathea games took everything they've learned from the project and put it into ""my time at sandrock"".
this new title has been improved over the original in every way possible: graphics, artstyle, combat, animations, activities, characters, story... the list covers literally every single aspect of the game, and even if there's still some rough edges here and there, they're very minor and don't hinder at all the quality of the product.

the game combines life-style (housing, crafting, resource gathering, bonding with other characters...) with action/adventure gameplay (exploration, rpg elements, dungeons, boss fights...). all the while, the city of sandrock grows and develops over time and as the story goes forward, with your contribution.
there's also a dedicated multiplayer mode, focusing exclusively on everything revolving around managing your workshop (no story progression, unfortunately, but the fact it's there as an option to have fun with friends in a game that doesn't really need multiplayer, is already more than enough).

if you're in for a fun, hopeful, wholesome and pleasant adventure filled with likeable characters in a vibrant, living world that makes you truly feel a part of it, then there's no reasons not to give this game a try. 
you'll be genuinely suprised by seeing how much care, affection and attention to details have been put into crafting this little gem and what it has to offer.
the part where you're a builder, tasked with gathering resources and building things is truly just part of the tip of a huge iceberg.

even at full price, it's well worth the money.",15092
2023-11-10,"i love the game, i spent 35 hours on the beginning of early access and then i decided to wait for the game to be released in 1.0. after 12h in 1.0 the game as a lot of problems and it looks like it's still in the same stage as early access.

- poor optimization (i7-10700k + rtx 2080 super).
- random little loading times (loading inventory or talking to people).
- buildings that disappear and respawn after a few seconds.
- the french translation is not very good.
- multiplayer is just a sandbox with no story, success, or romance etc..

i really liked my time at portia and i really like sandrock but all these small/big problems make the game less pleasant to play.
why release a game from early access if it's still so poorly optimized and full of bugs?

hopefully, future updates will make the game more stable and less frustrating.",15092
2023-11-10,"greetings,

i actually enjoy this game ~ its fun to play with your partner and ofc for me its good because it has a level system and has dungeons.
the multiplayer still has some small bugs but the devs actually care about this game and keep fixing stuff.

-> important fix that should happen is the micro frame drop whenever you pickup loot from either mines or chest.

thats really about it, i highly recommend this game if you have someone to play it with since it just makes so much more fun",15092
2023-11-10,"  most of the accessible males in this game are overweight or not as good-looking. but most women are thin and good-looking, and their height is exactly the same. can't marriageable women be as diverse as men? 

  it doesn't follow the announced update plans at all, and the conversation is also very single. npcs say the same lines every day. 

  i don't want to play a game that makes me feel discriminatory towards women. 

2023/11/13 for those men who comment on clowns, i just want to say: who is the real clown? are the ugly men offended?

thank you for your reply from the development team. although i don't hold onto hope, i still look forward to a tall, cool, muscular and marriageable female character. if there are more diverse female characters, i believe this series of games will have a better reputation.",15092
2023-11-10,"i absolutely love this game, just as much as i love stardew which i've sunk about 300ish hours into. i've also played my time at portia but not as long, can't quite remember much of it so i can't do much of a comparison between the two. regardless, my time at sandrock is a definite game for people to play if they enjoyed the previous my time game, especially with the qol improvements and stardew valley.

i love the characters so much in this game that i can't just choose one person to marry, mainly the men and some of the women  lol. their stories are just so fleshed out that i love them a lot. i honestly don't know what else to say but this is definitely a recommended game for people to play ^^",15092

2023-11-10,"this game is enjoyable... it's better than my time at portia, but only barely. the writing is genuinely good and voice acting is great. the characters themselves look great as well. inventory is improved but i am not sure that warrants immense praise in a sequel, i would expect more mechanical improvements. the characters are definitely more demanding and engaged. some times i wish they would honestly shove off though, a lot of them are deeply self centered and narcissistic. it's an attempt to show a more realistic community i guess, but so many of them track anti-social and deeply narcissistic that i am not sure who i actually like in the town. kudos i guess on making it feel like i really am in a backwater trash town.

but i waited a long time for it to leave early access, and now i am playing a game that still feels like it is in early access. 

additionally, level design feels very strange. the over world feels janky and the dungeons half baked in design. a lot of areas blocked by invisible walls and lazy graphics.

the town itself is not particularly impressive and walking away from locations feels like i am walking on an unfinished map. many locations are deeply confusing to find and there are many absolutely pointless time wasting caves that have absolutely nothing in them except maybe a chest that drops a pointless piece of loot.

enemy's feel buggy and some of them are massively annoying to fight with a melee weapon. hyena's jump and move constantly, rat men spawn in the air and can't be attacked. combat is definitely more engineered from portia but it doesn't necessarily feel better chasing around a enemy that essentially non-stop roll dodges.

the denizens look better, but you look like a carnival clown. why are we still throwing utility pouches on things like they are 90s super heroes? why can't anyone make a decent pare of pants, i'm tired of running around in ill fitting shorts. i feel like you should be able to reskin the armor in the game to others you have unlocked. maybe that is a thing but it isn't apparent.

----

response to developer:
there are several instances where the corners of the paradise lost (i believe, first combat dungeon) has areas that look traversable that aren't. the fence going into paradise lost looks scalable. walking into the gecko station there is a large dead space around the entrance that can't be walked through, you have to approach the station entrance straight on dead center to enter. aside from that there are several areas that just seems empty though accessible including caves with little reward for exploring them. feels more like i am punished for exploring in a game at least partial about time management, i now default look up a guide the second i am confused. often the guide itself is confused like in the case with of the quest ""whispers of the heart"" where the streamer enters the cave thinking it might be where the quest location is. understandable since heidi appears to lead you there but then disappears (got stuck on terrain in my game) teleportating to the location but with no quest marker except a zone on the map. a quest with no timer listed but which logically does need to be completed that day and fails if not completed.

speaking of quests that need to be completed on time, there are a ton that auto trigger by walking into zones and they can overlap with other quests you have happening. perhaps you designed this to encourage players to not do quests saving them for future playthrough, but i don't think the majority of your users do play the game more than once. games this scale are huge timesinks and i would like to not decline side plot character arc stuff simply because i have 3 of them going simultaneously.the pacing of quests simply doesn't feel in line with the default speed of the game. i understand i can adjust this but i would like the game at least defaulting to an optimal experience. this likely goes into my feelings towards the townfolk being off putting, berating me with quests that really seem like they should be commissions (owen being the biggest offender though also not being told to stop like the others).

after experiencing the combat more i think the problem is the lack of mobility in the main character during a fight. you feel dark souls speed while everyone else (non-duel) feels like they are playing an arcade beat-em up.

i realize now there is a wardrobe tab, not sure how i missed it. apologies for that criticism. now i can wear my button up (with strange disco medalion/compass) and pants like a normie.

i think some of my irritation is the above mentioned side quest pacing. a lot of characters don't really grow much and feel very one sided in their relationship with you, qi in particular is deeply narcissistic and so central to the plot. there are definitely great characters but the ones who have big character flaws very rarely if ever showcase anything redeeming. would be satisfying to be able to get back at yan even a little and i have been playing the game for an in game year. arvio really needs to not be a screw up once in a while. amirah has 0 warmth even after being stuck making 50 fireworks for an event no one shows up to she responds to with a trailing ellipsis. i mean what is the player expectation here? if it's just the clique getting together to watch fireworks than why not have that happen? if it's a setup for a date why does amirah respond to even the most mild show of affection with a trailing ellipsis? how long do you want me to humor this fleeting youth club when they don't show up to their own events and, if it's a romance line, don't seem interested in you? i feel like i am doing a huge number of quests just to up relationship points, not because i enjoy them.

when's justice going to not be a failure riding off others? i'd love him to show some reason why anyone would want him as sheriff. miguel is a psycho. fang drugs me for his own amusement.

final complaint, clay and bloodstone are deeply relied on for commissions. they are very difficult to source without going back to the first dungeon or buying some from a store behind a loading screen. i have so much stone and sand at this point i could forge another sandrock in an effort to source clay and bloodstone and this is with me having built up a ton of bloodstone building a ridiculous field of moisture farms and needing the marble (p.s. please let us automate collection from these or something...).",15092

2023-11-09,"sandrock takes all of the cute charm from the first game and cranks it up to 11. 
combat has been greatly expanded and improved from the first game. the inclusion of boss fights with actual mechanics is something i never thought a cozy game like this would include. i was surprised when the mechanical cat boss showed up and i couldn't just spam the attack button on it. 
as for the visuals of the game, they are charming. the townsfolk feel much more alive than the first game and i am super glad they got rid of the main characters voice which was my biggest dislike from portia. this is just personal preference though, i've never been a fan of voiced pcs.

has everything that portia had but with small changes to the design to make the game more enjoyable! e.g you can place bigger storage boxes on top of the current smaller ones instead of removing everything from inside of the box minecraft style, or when carrying out a quest which requires items on hand, you can still complete it with the items still back at the workshop when in storage!

i am praying. please let this series continue.",15069
2023-11-09,"i had not played previous games by this developer, so for me there was a fairly hefty learning curve.  still, the story line, visuals, interaction, and game play are all interesting and very enjoyable.  it quickly became the game i want to play more than others.  
it isn't without bugs, but the developer is responsive and releasing patches frequently.  none of the glitches i've experienced have impacted my ability to play the game.  at one point the event audio got out-of-sync and i was hearing dialog from both previous and future events.  it was annoying, but not a game-stopper and closing/reopening the game resolved it.  another issue where display of elevators was lagging saw a fix released the very next day (kudos!) 
for me, the user interface seems inconsistent and somewhat clunky.  here are a few examples:  i'm not a fan of holding 'tab' to switch to garden mode, scrolling to select an action, then pressing 'e' to select the seed, etc.  at worst, it can be frustrating determining the mouse/keystrokes needed to perform an action.  at best, it is never something i can do via muscle-memory without thinking.  device production statistics is also not well laid out. even after playing a considerable time i still have to study each machine's statistics to find the bit of information i'm looking for.   one positive, there is an icon in each device that allows focusing it to requirements of pending tasks--love that.  there is also a need for improvement to the main map to add more detail and descriptions.  an item might say it can be found in the quarry, but the quarry is not labelled on the map.  
the above items are minor to me and overall i enjoy this game and highly recommend it.

2023-11-09,"you can explore, construct, and interact with people in a post-apocalyptic desert village in the endearing and captivating life simulation game my time at sandrock. i've spent the last 14 hours playing this game, and i highly suggest it.

to keep you interested, the game offers a ton of features and content, such the ability to make hundreds of objects, interact with the locals and fall in love, cultivate crops, battle monsters, and take part in festivals and minigames. the voice acting is funny and well-done, the music is catchy and calming, and the images are vivid and colorful.",15069
2023-11-09,"if you played my time at portia and enjoyed it - you'll love this one! tons of quality of life features have gone in that make it a blast to play, especially with inventory management which is one of the biggest factors of this type of game (such as naming your chests, and an ability to ""just stack similar items from my inventory into any of my chests"") 

in comparison to something such as stardew valley (love!) i would say it's similar but different. sandrock isn't a farming sim for one - it's mostly focused on you being a builder. so it's a lot more on getting a workshop, crafting, setting up automation, etc. 
of course there is still animal rearing and farming that can be had! but it's not the primary focus. 

the world is still a great time, the characters in the city are fantastic (and voice acted often!) and a blast to go out on dates, have lunch with, or just say howdy in the town for. 

the combat is rather enjoyable as well! makes monster battling more enjoyable than many other games of this style. 

big tip i'd have: if you find the days going by too quick (or too slow), you can change the gameplay speed! i found at first a little overwhelmed as i was trying to do commissions each day & by the time i finished, i was running out of daylight! but then i just changed the gameplay speed (0.7 is my sweet spot i think) and it's just the perfect amount for me. 

overall, if you like cozy life sim's where you can just sit back, relax and enjoy yourself. would recommend :)",15069

it's very, very similar to my time at portia so if you are happy for pretty much the same gameplay (at least after 25 hours it seems the same), then you will love this.

2023-11-09,"i don't really get the hype i guess. the characters are pretty fun, but feel very one-dimensional. the combat looks great until you actually start fighting. and why is everything so insanely vast and empty? the comically large buildings make the town feel like you could've just as well had a portal hub, and going from a to b makes you wonder why they even made a run button. might as well make it your standard speed since you're constantly pressing it.

definitely an upgrade from portia when it comes to the quality of life, but with the desert setting the problems i had with portia only get magnified in sandrock. if you didn't like portia don't get this game i guess",15069
2023-11-09,"please note that i am a kickstarter backer.

sandrock improves on portia by leaps and bounds. it takes the addicting loop of gathering resources to build machines to finish projects to build better machines to work with other resources and wraps it in a cozy blanket of interesting npcs and a deep setting. 

this is not a farming game. even though it will inevitably be compared to stardew and the wave of other similar games that have been released over the years, this is not a farming game. to me personally, sandrock is much closer to modded minecraft, factorio, or satisfactory. what you do get, inspired by stardew (harvest moon, shout out to the og) and its legacy, are npcs to talk to and romance, quests to fulfil for said npcs, and regular festivals.

i personally enjoy the very clear loop of resource gathering and refinement to fulfil quests immensely. like portia (as rough around the edges as it was), sandrock is very good at finding the balance between regular resource gathering to make any progress, without becoming too grindy (but! i'd guess i am in the latter first third of the game, so who knows if this stays true). resources can be acquired in many ways, and there's always one that is easiest or most enjoyable to do. 

npcs feel much deeper than in your average cozy farming game, with several of them having their own agency beyond reacting to your input. you might want to romance one of the bachelorettes, but she might not be sure that it's something that fits into her or your life - and so you have to do quests and navigate dialogue to figure the problem out together.
many of the npcs also step out of the typical archetypes as you get to know them, or offer archetypes from the get-go that aren't often used in these types of games. 

i thoroughly enjoy the writing, which i did not expect to this amount. i certainly liked portia, but i feel like the localisation of sandrock is a big improvement (except for not giving us qi's or fang's full names!). there are plenty of references to popular culture that actually made me chuckle. 

several - but not all - voice actors are also doing a fantastic job. i had pen written off as uninteresting from the start, but his voice actor is doing an incredible job with his character, and i have come to enjoy him much more than i thought. however, some voice actors keep throwing me off with their line deliveries, or their accents. nothing i could not see beyond or that would fully break immersion, but still noticeable if contrasted with the excellent other cast members.

at time of writing this review, i have played through 1.5 seasons in about 30 hours of gameplay. i do not rush any quests and make full use of the non-existent deadlines for major plot quests. i feel like i am just about have the plot open up for me, and have not even arrived at later content that is hailed to be the best. i'm certainly looking forward to experiencing the rest of this game, and would recommend this game to anyone.",15069

2023-11-09,"multiplayer has zero story missions and zero achievements, which they do not tell you before you buy!! i only bought this game to play with my bf, and we had a lot of fun building our home together and improving the town, but we were extremely disappointed that we cannot experience the story together, and with nearly 40 hours into the game, we still haven't unlocked a single achievement. i will never play this game solo, i am only interested in playing multiplayer, and i feel cheated out of the full experience. if they add story missions and achievements to multiplayer, then i will change my review to recommended.",15069
2023-11-09,"this is a tremendously satisfying game about harvesting materials, crafting, completing tasks, and helping a town prosper.  it's easy to see just a few hours in just how much thought has gone into the systems.  there's plenty to do to fill a day, and new main and side quests pop up on the regular to keep you moving forward.  the game respects your time with convenient tooltips, tutorials, and things like paying to expand your bags directly from your inventory, or being able to complete objectives with materials in your storage.

the social aspect of the game is also surprisingly strong.  the characters are often interesting and the writing is genuinely funny.  there's an interplay of story and gameplay as certain events will cause prices of goods to fluctuate or prompt a community response.  there are mini-activities to do with townsfolk to increase affinity and neat holidays.  there's also lore bits here and there that i did not expect to be as poignant as they are. 

there is combat, and it is fine, but i do not think that is the main draw.  my only complaints would be nitpicks.  the random character customization produces some nightmarish results, and the house expansion system is somewhat fiddly.  

this is a strong recommend.",15069

2023-11-15,"the best, chillest game ever!",8270
2023-11-09,"i liked ""my time at portia"" in spite of what it needed still in terms of polish. it was an ambitious game with many of the things it tried felt mostly half baked and not fully flushed out.

i can happily say that ""my time at sandrock"" not only meets the levels set up by it's predecessor, but also far exceeds them. 

first, the game proudly sticks with it's theme. every aspect of this is themed around you being in a desert, from basic crafting to even fishing. on a side note, this is easily the better fishing mini games i've played, but i wont spoil how that works.

second, the story is very engaging. ~50ish hours in, i'm very immersed in the setting and very motivated to keep going. the characters all seem to have their own motivations and there's a plethora of areas where their quests have pay off, both big and small. the small, being a mark of true craftsmanship.

third, the relationship mechanics are fantastic. they don't expand the barebones from the previous game (if it ain't broke don't fix it) but there's more to do around sandrock than portia. i do have a favorite addition though [spoiler] you literally hold hands with your partner when you're out on a date, they'll keep up with you as you run. this is the cutest damn thing in the world. bless whomever pushed that to get in because it was worth it.[/spoiler] 

if you've played the sequel, than this should be a no brainer. if you've not played the series, if not, i'd probably recommend going with the previous game first, but don't let that stop you if you're eager to start. there's nothing in portia that's critical for sandrock to be enjoyable.",15069
2023-11-09,"      as someone who has played their fair share of life simulation games, with the variety of animal crossing, stardew valley, and palia to be some of the main ones, this game comes very close to beating them all. i was thrilled to find out that this game was going to have multiplayer in it, seeing as my time at portia does not have multiplayer, which heavily influenced my choice to buy it or not.

      this game can be buggy at times and while i only have a 980 gpu, i can run this game at medium settings and it still looks pretty decent. i did not play the early access, only full release, and i can say that there seems to be quite a bit of content to this game. this game is very multifaceted with social/town, farming, combat, mining, building, animal, and pet aspects, with that just being what i have discovered with 19 hours of playing. i play with 2 other people and the game runs fairly well. i have only encountered a few lag/server sync issues between other players, a few ui glitch errors, and 1 wonky combat fight with an elite. but beyond those few things i haven't seen much to stop me from wanting to play this game as much as possible. 


[h3] pros [/h3]
- lots of content (19 hours in and it feels like i have so much more to do)
- decent price (i was gifted the game but seeing the price for how fun this game is seems fair)
- fun with friends
- multiplayer actual works
- leveling up feels important and good
- missions feel good and not like leg work (you can visually see the work you put into the town)
- tons of townspeople
- combat feels good and fun
- character customization (you can super customize your character with sliders)
- gear (weapons and clothes have stats that can help you with gathering and fighting)
- weather (the weather events in this game are really great. so far i have seen rain, sandstorm, and summer 
   heat. i am waiting to see snow in this game as of yet.)
- server stays up (no matter who owns the town, i am able to play on my friends server even after the 
   person who made it has left. this is a big game changer for me seeing as you don't have to stop playing on 
   one server because the host has left or crashed.)

[h3] cons [/h3]

- desync/stutter issues (i have only had this happen 2-3 times playing so far and it is fixed by a simple return 
  to lobby and rejoin.)
- ui machine icons disappear (i have only seen this once and it was fixed by rejoining the lobby)
- forced personal chests (i mention this because it was a pain to have only so much room in the one 
   community chest you get at the start of the game. you can upgrade it, but i would like to have the option 
   to share my personal chest contents if i choose to. and not have to run back to home every time someone 
   needed something.
- combat (could use a little work on hit registration and how your character can go through the enemies 
   while swinging your weapon)
- accidental playable character requests (in the game there is an option to talk to real people and play a 
   mini-game called critters. it feels a bit annoying at times when you are trying to interact with machines or 
   doors and other playable characters get the input over the item/machine/door. could be quite annoying if 
   playing with a lot of people in one area but not too bad overall.)

overall this game feels pretty fun to play and in just 2 days my friends and i have put in almost 20 hours each.",15069
2023-11-09,"update: newest game update has significantly decreased my issues, i still experience some long loading screens, but the game is playable, and waiting 5-10 minutes the odd time is fine. thank you for this quick hot fix. 


unfortunately the game is unplayable solo, i can play bg3 on ultra settings. but solo sandrocks loading screens take 10-15 minutes (sometimes longer) per interaction, sleep, leaving/entering the home, or literally anything in the game, including talking to npc's. i have barley any issues on multiplayer, other then the fact some areas/missions are impossible due to certain things missing in multi(but its playable).

i waited for the release because i was such a fan of the first one and even played via xbox live pass.

currently i am surfing the web for fixes, from uninstalling, reinstalling, turning cloud off, turning every setting to low, switching graphics cards/cpu's. mind you i have no other processes running, and can play other games that require so much more usage. currently re-verifying the files, in hopes i can play the game solo when my partner is not on, and not ruin our multiplayer game. 

currently i consider this game to be completely early access still, and unplayable for most. i found online via reddit, many people having the same issue. 

developers i am sorry but until this is fixed, this review will remain the same, as your product is extremely expensive and at least should run the basics like being able to leave/enter my home, or sleep without it taking 15+ minutes each thing.

i really liked how they changed how you're able to build items, you don't need to have something in your hand in order to have it built. and when diving in ruins, the scanner highlights all of the possible relics instead of just one at a time. the map is huge, and even though its a desert, there is a lot to do especially with hunting monsters and collecting materials.

2023-11-05,"long time portia player here. i bought my time at sandrock very early in development and then shelved it until the 1.0 release. i must say that it was worth the wait. you have delievered an awesome product here, there is so much improvement in the overall quality and the depth of gameplay compared to my time at portia. this is a worthy next part in the my time series. thank you for your hard work, you can be proud of the result!",19735
2023-11-05,"i love this game, its chill, its non-punishing, its stress free, its just a really charming and sweet game. i liked portia as well, but never spent nearly the amount of hours i did in this game. i still haven't even finished the story. 

the devs really did a wonderful job improving upon the previous game's mechanics, making a lot of qol improvements that just make the game that much more relaxing and enjoyable. the art is clean and adorable, and the characters are very well done, just like they were in the previous game. i can't stop myself from coming back to these lovable idiots, and i mean that in the most endearing way possible. :d

if you like life sim games, this game has a bit of everything, some farming mechanics, a very basic fishing system that's not your traditional fishing minigame, but its easy and doesn't feel burdensome or required. i love the transmog system the devs have added to allow outfit customization of the character, so you don't have to worry about stats over looks. 

well done, pathea games, well done! thanks for giving us a fun escape from the troubles of life with such a charming and beautiful world.",19735
2023-11-05,"have you ever tried getting into stardew valley and thought to yourself ""this game is fun but i wish it were 3d?"" well, i would have to say my time at sandrock is just that game. not only is it a huge improvement over my time at portia, but its probably the ultimate ""chill out"" game. great for enjoying a game and retaining positive vibes throughout the playthrough. i'm still pretty early in but i can see myself playing this often after a long day.

i don't normally play these type of games (i'm more into action and strategy) but this game does a great job retaining my attention and keeping me positive. great job to the devs! highly recommended.",19735

2023-11-09,"if you like portia, you'll love this game. it has all its charm, with improved graphics and mechanics. the only thing i don't like is home customization, which is very hard to get used to. some of the late-game stuff requires you to build something from the ground up, which i didn't like. it would be good if pre-built options were available in future updates.",15069
2023-11-08,"i played portia, a while ago. i've had sandrock on my radar for a while. when i saw that they were intending to put multiplayer in, i thought to myself i can afford to wait until it's actually here. when it dropped, i had time and so did my usual co-op buddies and we jumped into it. one of my friends had played portia and the other had not. 

sandrock has had me gripped for a few days now, and i have only barely touched single player, spending almost all of my time in multiplayer. to those who have played portia, the multiplayer focuses on the gameplay and it delivers. it is very improved over what we had in portia. to those who are not familiar, who are just looking for a game to play with the people they play games with: do you enjoy games like stardew valley or minecraft, where everyone can kinda pick a 'job' and meet up at the house or base at the start and end of the day and spend the middle doing who knows what? if yes, you'll like sandrock. there are things like co-op bounties, co-op forms of the ruins where you hunt treasure, co-op dungeons, what seemed like a raid? (had its own tokens, was timed/scored) sure, after enough time, you're going to  max out your skill tree and start dipping into others, but the join/drop nature of the game (up to four people) means that there's ... often ... a lot to do. if you hit the ground with both feet running, there's tons of jobs to do. you can build yourself into a coma. you can go and make friends with townsfolk. you can try to get rich. 

the urban planning mechanic is well thought out and it works well. i'd maybe twist the ranching store to come online a little earlier (by the time i unlocked ranching it felt like i was so late in the tree that it only existed as a means to get yak hair) but it's fun. it's fun to build your workshop and build your house and build your skills and build your relationships. it's fun. there is no overarching story in multiplayer but you do iterate on the town through how you progress your commissions and by doing the urban planner. it's a good game for hangin' out with the guys. really.

as for the progression? it can be kinda hard, at times. not the combat, but figuring out where to get very specific tidbits you'll need. and the building commissions start to ramp up when you roam around the map. sometimes, you don't have the ability to get or refine the things you need for the commissions. i've constantly opened the wiki to guide me in the game, which is something i do for a lot of games, but i know some people are dead set against it.

also, relationships with npcs move slow. sometimes, i can't find the people i am looking for. there's a lot to learn how to do in this game because there's a lot to learn how to do. i still only know like four food recipes. there are sometimes minor bugs but i am guessing they'll get ironed out soon enough. nothing so serious as a crash or any lost progress. it's not a perfect game, but it's better than portia, which i already thought was good. and if you're into the genre, it's absolutely worth picking up.",15199
2023-11-08,"if you liked my time in portia, then this is more of that, polished and with new features. it's a cute crafting game with combat, some building, many characters and story.

the gameplay in the beginning can feel restricted and slow, and you have to rush to meet your daily goals. this does of course become easier and can be tweaked with game settings and mods if you want.

the story is overall lighthearted and often silly, but does have some underlying messages and darker tones.

between gathering resources, crafting, dungeons and many events, you can easily sink many hours into this game. i am currently 27 hours in and feel like i have barely started.",15199
2023-11-08,"a nice follow-up on portia. some nice qol stuff, and the characters are more varied and the story seems a little deeper and better told. i do suspect that if i hadn't played portia i would have been a little lost at understanding the game systems and the flow of play, and portia was polished enough that i would recommend you play both games in sequence rather than jumping to this one.",15199
2023-11-08,"the trailer is very misleading, bought this with my girlfriend expecting that it's singleplayer with multiplayer but apparently it's 2 different game modes, the multiplayer being just endless grinding of contracts with no story. the game is great otherwise but i'm very disappointed that they advertise it in such an unclear (and yes only after i bought it i read the ""multiplayer release"" announcement which is 6 months old) and almost scummy way.",15199
2023-11-08,"man, i was so excited to play this game with my boyfriend until we discovered that the multiplayer is just an endless grind without any story. unfortunately this meant that the game is not what they led to believe it is and therefore not worth the money. we thought we would get a cozy stardew valley - kind of game with cute graphics and story, but there is no point in the multiplayer if it's just running around and grinding materials.",15199
2023-11-06,"very good game! the developers continued on their first idea (my time at portia) and vastly improved on it. there is no need to have played the previous game to enjoy this one. it got great characters, nice story, never a dull moment, crafting, grinding, farming, ranching, mining, sandfishing it got levels, relationship, events and you build stuff that are in the game world and not just on your land bit everywhere. i absolutely loved my time at portia and my time at sandrock is just amazing. can't leave the game alone. so looking forward to see what comes next!",16388
2023-11-05,this is a very charming farm/crafting sim with a pleasant art style. the occasional combat is also fairly enjoyable even if the combo system is really basic. i've been here for 5 hours (no early access since i wasn't interested in the prequel and didn't expect a sequel) but apparently there's like 30+ hours for the main story alone which is great for the price tag especially considering how invested you can get in some of the side stuff.,19735
2023-11-05,"if you liked mtap, this is more of the same, but better polished and more fun moment to moment. very good, verging on great.

2023-11-09,i wanted to wait and see if they'd actually complete the game or release an unfinished and buggy one.. if they had focused on the game and not trying to milk more money with dlc i would recommend but they didn't and i don't...,15069
2023-11-08,"this is one of the best life simulator games i have ever played, hands down! it does have a few minor problems but they're barely notable and the pros here far outweigh any cons.

what i think...

+ pros +
++++++++
+ beautiful visuals and characters
+ astounding game mechanics
+ tons and i do mean tons to do for hours on end
+ awesome crafting system
+ awesome building/upgrade system
+ easy to understand and play
+ challenging enemies
+ lots of quests and side missions
+ mail system that actually makes sense and lets you respond
+ town news that makes sense, you can subscribe to get updates on things happening in town
+ finally, a town that feels and looks legit, lots of stores, an arcade, and more
+ lots of mini games and events
+ lots of glorious cutscenes
+ feels very realistic in a lot of ways
+ gameplay draws you in a lot
+ lots of collectibles
+ lots of areas
+ singleplayer and multiplayer
+ lots of replay value


- cons -
----------
- multiplayer starts of with no house and a lot of missing buildings, this makes absolutely no sense
- controls in multiplayer are by default different than singleplayer, this too makes absolutely no sense
- player water tower to refill with water should have a visual meter to indicate water in it since it's extremely annoying just to have to open it up to check ever time and that makes it difficult to know if you're running low or not while busy with other town commisions and such. a simple visual meter on the side of the tank would make life so much better.
- a lot of the pop-ups such as hints/tips from quests and wandering around show up during cutscenes and can easily be missed as they don't stay there long so you might miss something important and thats very frustating


= verdict =
==========
= my time at sandrock takes everything about the first game and makes it even better plus a little more! there is literally so much detail and realism packed into this wonderful stylized game to keep you busy with the game for hours on end and when you think it stops no it doesn't you can take things on again pretty much through continued multiplayer! its a wonderful game with so many great gameplay machanics and you'll never want to put it down! i highly recommend it! i really hope to see this game come to android as well like the first one did! i would buy it on mobile in a heartbeat! thanks devs for making this amazing game!

2023-11-08,"was an early supporter of this game because i loved my time at portia. sandrock is just as amazing as portia, i feel like portia and sandrock are the only games of its kind. panthea never fails, this one, just like portia was full of twist, full of love-able and hate-able characters. the bachelors are top tier, same with some of the bachelorettes. a lot is improved from portia, i feel like there's way more sentiments for the characters and i actually think this game felt longer then portia. it was really fun trying to stop the desertification, and its always fun to be able to fight against duvos, like the first game. if another game comes along in this series (pc/console game, i know there's a mobile, which ill probably play too). i will 100% buy, i know they teased as an april fools my time at duvos, which, since that's a city under a dictatorship and is the problem for most of the free cities, my god, would be amazing. i know they have a lot of towns they can work with, through both games and hopefully there's more to the story, more games in the future, because i am invested.",15199

2023-11-08,"i only found out about this series about a week ago and holy cow, mtas is the next-gen 3d farm/life game i've always wanted since playing stardew valley. 

the npcs and characters have so much heart/quirk/personality and the game never takes itself too seriously with incredibly comedic and heartfelt quests, story, plot twists, and more. all the characters are so memorable and get fleshed out in incredible side quests that had my partner and i laughing out loud or audibly ""awww!""-ing.

building, sound design, graphics, combat, exploration, skill progression, pacing and more have made this game both incredibly addicting and relaxing, with some amazing quality-of-life changes over the typical farm/life/survival/etc sim games i haven't seen before.

2023-11-07,"like exploration and hate invisible walls impeding exploration?  then, this game is not for you.

0/1, devs need to learn invisible walls are always bad design.  make interesting barriers or give an actual reason instead of invisible walls.

also, multiplayer feels like a completely different game than singleplayer.  there's not feature parity between the two, and many mechanics work differently for crafting and combat.

0/1, devs need to get feature consistency and parity between the two game modes.

movement is also very uncontrollable on keyboard and mouse.  my time at portia did movement better as your character had an infinitesimal turn radius, whereas in sandrock you will have a turn radius, which makes precision quite difficult.

0/1, devs need to revert the movement system to my time at portia.

the only thing this game has going so far is its multiplayer, because it's fun to strategize resource production.  however, my time at portia is the overall better game in very many respects.

overall:

0/1 for singleplayer; and
0/1-1/1 for multiplayer, if you have a group to play with.

if my time at portia had multiplayer (even a mod), this game would not be worthwhile.",15801
2023-11-08,"this game deserves more attention! although my time at portia was a rough-edged gem that i still enjoyed quite a lot, sandrock greatly improves on its predecessor in almost every way. the town and characters are brimming with personality, the story is great, the quests feel meaningful, and overall the game just feels good to play. the quality-of-life improvements over the original are significant, especially regarding storage. combat still isn't perfect, though it's significantly better this time around. there is just so much to do in this game, and the loop is very addictive and fun!

if you never played portia, it's a bit hard to describe this game. it's not a ""farming game"", although you can do a bit of that. rather, you are a builder. you salvage, mine, gather, and refine materials, and use those to make and build whatever the town's inhabitants request. there is a heavy focus on characters, relationships, and story, in addition to the surprisingly interesting crafting system. the requests and commissions range from small items, to pieces of furniture, to useful structures that actually get placed permanently in the environment. you, your home (inside and out), and your yard are all highly customizable. almost everything you wear actually shows on your character, too, which is pretty neat!

the desert setting is more than just a backdrop, too. farming is a challenge. sandstorms are a threat. in order to keep your crafting machines running smoothly, you must keep them fueled, clean of sand, and cooled with water. collection and conservation of water is important in this game, not only as a theme, but also in practice. it should be tedious, but somehow it's not, i think due to just how well they implemented this ""you are living in a desert"" theme overall.

the only two negatives i can think of are a bit of lag as things load in when transitioning areas, and the often charmingly-awkward voice acting. neither of these are enough to even dampen my experience, though. i truly hope this is only the second in a long series of my time games!",15199

2023-11-07,"there are few games i sit with such great anticipation, dropping everything else to play at launch. as a long time portia fan, i made the decision to wait for the full launch of sandrock so i could  really delve into the experience. it was well worth the wait!! 

mechanics that i loved in portia were only improved by sandrock, i applause the mining and archaeology process! i am glad it's so much easier to manage artifacts and the geodes of ore. i also enjoy the addition of the scrap yard contracts for those older ore types you don't always want to get digging for.

the combat addition of the gun is really funny and clever with the western vibe. although simple, the harder bosses do give a dark soul vibe with the roll dodging.

crafting has only gotten better, and i am glad certain quests don't ask for an egregious number of supplies like portia did some times. very reasonable and smooth to escalate types.

characters! wowie! this has gone leaps and bounds from portia (although i will always love them!) each character is so unique! love the full dialogue for romance options, the personalities of all npcs are a hoot! the writing has me laughing so often, you can feel the love with each cutscene no matter the minor character. i find myself actually wanting to befriend each npc in the city, they all have such great personality!

the story has been just as fun as portia, i love the world building of this series. my only complaint is wanting more!! need a prequel surrounding peach or something. the enemies, the subtle build of tension with hints through the newspapers and letters are a great touch. i find myself excited to open the mail!

my only cons so far are:
bugs - very minor though. this game is so much cleaner than portia at launch, a bit of hair bugs or clothing doesn't hurt nobody.
npc pathing - ai is always hard to manage, but lord trying to find some of these people before friend status is a nightmare! 
unfortunate timings - i have had a few funny situations regarding cutscenes, sandstorms and time management. maybe i'm just very efficient, but sometimes the mix and match of time sensitive missions can be a nightmare. shout out to the calendar feature!

all in all, this game is an amazing addition to my much beloved portia. the team knocked it out of the park and it's great to see what a budget can do. i am genuinely excited for any and all extra content they may throw our way, and i hope they celebrate such an awesome launch!",15801

2023-11-07,"if you are getting this with the expectation of playing a multiplayer story, dont. multiplayer does not have any story missions and is just a sandbox mode that you can't fully progress in. even though they are heavily advertising the multiplayer mode, it is not something you can actually complete. you only have the co-op commissions and the co-op workshop, and that's pretty much it. i'm not sure how they are even able to advertise this as a multiplayer game. i bought 2 copies of this because i played the beta and my time at portia and loved them and wanted to play through this game with my wife. just to be sorely mistaken. multiplayer was also a promised feature, and while it is there, it's not actually a real multiplayer. gonna try and get a refund because this is very misleading advertising.",15801

2023-11-06,"wow, the level of improvement over your first game is amazing, well done.",16388
2023-11-06,"as you can probably tell from the playtime, i adore this game. coming in at the 200 hour mark (and possibly a few more) is no mean feat.

my time at sandrock took the formula pathea started in portia and dialed it up to the next level. the game plays roughly the same. you're a brand new builder that arrived at a town that is in decline and it is up to you to turn your talents to improve the lives of those around you.

the gameplay loop is fairly simple. go out into the wilds, gather resources, bring them back to your workshop and get your machines turning out the components necessary to fulfill your commissions, upgrade your capabilities and home, repeat. to do this, you manage stamina as you gather materials and also engage in light, fairly simple combat.

what pathea does well is package this up in a charming setting with an amazing cast of characters. the graphics engine, while simple, is supported by a unique art style that allows for a wide range of colorful residents of sandrock while keeping the system demand to a minimum. my 7800x3d and 7900xtx are utter overkill for this game. that said, don't let the relatively mild requirements fool you - the game is beautiful. the art style is timeless, the town has a unique feel and the landscape vistas are wonderful. i found myself taking in-game photos of things to take advantage of the customizable portrait decorations you can hang in your house and, later, factory.

the engine does have a few hitches. the draw distance is rather poor and there aren't intermediate level of detail models. objects will sort of pop into existence and if you have the lod bias set to anything less than maximum, you'll see the outline of a bubble immediately around you while the supports on your workshop's border fence pop into existence. it also struggles with longer game sessions, so if you play four hours at a time, you'll start to notice pathfinding breaking or weird artifacts like bushes floating up in space out in front of the temple of the light.

all in all though, i find the graphics and engine appealing. there are a few hitches and bugs here, though nothing experience breaking.

what really makes sandrock shine is the world pathea created. running in parallel with the events of portia, sandrock casts you as a builder that arrived in the town of the same name. the town is suffering from severe decline due to decades of resource mismanagement and environmental degradation. water is in short supply and routine sandstorms buffet the town, slowly chewing away what little life is left in the area. had it not been for a rich deposit of old world ruins, the town would have long since died and been left to vanish in the dunes of the euphala desert.

the town is populated with a rich cast of colorful characters with their own distinct personalities. my personal favorites are cooper, a local rancher who has a habit of speaking in lengthy diatribes and has a conspiracy theory streak (i swear cooper's voice actor had more lines than the next five characters combined), and unsuur, a well meaning but not too bright local deputy who loves rocks a bit too much who i liken to a combination of drax from guardians of the galaxy and barnie fife from the andy griffith show.

surprisingly, the plot is actually quite deep. there is more going on than a simple tale of you building up stuff. there is banditry, a conspiracy and more going on that has a surprising climax. sandrock not only has an interesting story, it goes well beyond what a charming life sim should be and fleshes out the broader world of the free cities alliance and the surrounding nations.

my time at sandrock is a solid combination of life sim and narrative experience combined with a light factory inventory management game. if you're looking for a nice change of pace, you can't go wrong here.",16388
2023-11-06,"wow, my time at sandrock is really an amazing game! after i got really disappointed by starfield and cities skylines: 2, i stumbled on my time at sandrock on youtube and also here on steam by some ads ... then i watched a few streams and bought it now!

it is such a nice game and i can't stop playing it! it's a mix of animal crossing and stardew valley and plays extremely well. it's not too childish and the ingame mechanics are very balanced. i am sure i can play this game for far beyond 100 hours! definitely worth the 30 bucks.",16388
2023-11-06,"amazing game, at first you would think nothing special, but i must say i played my time in partia and sandrock is a major improvement, if you dont know what this game is and you think on buying it definetly recomend, for new players the stamina system could be a bad thing, but give the game time, it sucks you in really fast. great story, great world, the game makes you feel like a real part of the town and when you notice how much you build in the world and how much it changes its really rewarding.",16388
2023-11-06,"a really nice relaxing farming game!!

single player may not be the most innovative story, but it is lovingly designed and fits the setting.
multiplayer works and the focus is on building the city, which is also a lot of fun.

i give it a clear purchase recommendation to anyone who likes cozy farming games like stardew valley, harvest moon and yes, animal crossing

so far there's only one point where i still have doubts and that is what is the replacement for the quest with the crane in order to be able to farm tin properly :d but i suspect that the error is more mine than the game :d but i'm open to any advice thankful :)

? ? ?

ein richtig schönes entspannendes farming spiel!! 
 
singleplayer ist vielleicht nicht die innovatievste story aber sie ist liebevoll gestaltet und passt zum setting.
multiplayer funktioniert und dort steht der stadtaufbau erstmal im vordergrund was auch sehr viel spaß macht.

von mir eine klare kaufempfehlung an jeden der auf cozy farming games steht wie stardew valley, harvest moon und ja auch animal crossing

bisher nur einen punkt an dem ich bis jetz noch verweifel und zwar was ist der ersatz für die quest mit dem kran um vernünftig tin farmen zu können :d aber da vermute ich den fehler mehr bei mir als beim spiel :d bin aber für jeden tip dankbar :)",16388
2023-11-06,"it should would be nice to be able to play enough of the game to actually give it a proper review but in my short play time i have had three freezes that required me to restart my entire pc.

one was hung on a black screen after a  cutscene and 2 were the audio distorting and slowing down leading up to freezes. the audio distortion followed by crashes was an issue they claimed to have fixed in the june 7th, 2022 patch notes, but several people complained they still had the issue and it was never mentioned by the devs again.

this is the second time pathea has released a game that i literally cannot play because of all the constant crashing even out of early access.",16388

2023-11-05,good,19735
2023-11-06,"unpopular opinion but i wasn't a fan of my time at portia and found it kind of overrated, so i was very surprised when my time at sandrock ended up being one of my favourite games of all time. i've played a lot of life sim style games and this is one of the best by far - it's the only one i've played to rival my love of rune factory 4 in terms of gameplay, story and character dialogue.

i have 110+ hours in the game (started a bit before the 1.0 release) and i'm not even finished the main story quests yet, i thought i was almost done a while back and it turned out i was only 2/3 of the way through. there are always meaningful story events happening and new characters being introduced to keep things interesting. 

there are a lot of activities to do each day to stop things getting too monotonous - a mix of exploration, dungeon crawling, mining or hanging around town. you can also fish and farm, which i'm not too fond of doing in this game but are totally optional outside of a couple of quests. 

the characters are where this game stands out - the localization team did a great job with the dialogue because it's full of personality and can be pretty hilarious at times. the town is very lively with the characters all having different relationships to each other and having a lot of joint quests and scenes so it feels like a real community. one downside is the day to day dialogue lines can get kind of repetitive but there are a lot of character related events which is where the bulk of the content is. their faces are also not that expressive in dialogue which would be my main complaint, but the voice acting is very expressive and fills that gap. 

there are some bugs at the moment but the devs seem very active and engaged with the community. aside from the bugs the game feels very polished, and i'm honestly blown away at the sheer scale of it for a relatively small company. there is so much content, from the very long main story, to the numerous character quests, to the new locations, mines and dungeons to unlock. and unlike portia each mine/ruin feels unique and has distinct level design features to keep things interesting. honestly huge props to the devs for what they've achieved here, you can tell a lot of love was put into the game and they genuinely had fun with the world and characters they created (speaking of the world, the worldbuilding is pretty in depth and the setting is very interesting - i did love the concept of my time at portia despite my criticisms of the game, and that interesting history continues to be explored here).",16388
2023-11-06,:),16388
2023-11-06,"let me preface this by saying that i played my time at portia and didn't enjoy it at all. my time at sandrock absolutely blows it out of the water, and addresses my two most standout grievances about the first.

this time, they have designed the map properly so that your character never spends too long traversing from one location to another. the town map/level is beautifully made so that your workshop is never too far from any npcs you might need to reach/chat with daily. secondly, this is the most fun i've had with a towns' npc population in a while. a lot of cozy game developers forget to develop their characters beyond the basic, typical strokes. at first i felt like this would be the case for sandrock too, but i found myself genuinely enjoying a lot of the town's npc personalities that shine through their questlines. the writing isn't nearly the best i've seen in a game, but it's definitely a step above most cozy games i've played recently. at least more fun, if anything!

if i had to pick at any obvious downsides, i'd say that some voice actors are clearly uncomfortable in their characters' accents and inflections and it shows. i don't mind it too much but it might be grating to some.

as of the time of writing, i'm 40 hours in and i'm still being engaged with the game, so it earns my seal of approval.",16388
2023-11-06,"man, i'd love to be able to play enough of this game to give it a genuine review, but i can't play for more than a minute at a time because of the crashes. this game is so needlessly demanding graphically that it somehow corrupted my graphics card drivers twice! for now, don't pay over 30 bucks for a crash simulator.",16388

2023-11-06,"i usually like the more laid-back farming games but being a builder is fun! i love the characters and the story line so far. i am only 23 hours into the game, i am not sure about end-game content yet. i haven't even met all the characters yet. i hope it's a long on ongoing game. i got this while i was waiting for coral island release and i wasn't expecting to love it as much as i do! highly recommend!",16388

2023-11-05,"nice game, would be better if the dev console wasn't rendered inaccessible upon full launch. don't get me wrong, pathea makes grinding fun more than a chore, but when your whole game revolves around grinding, god, you've got to let people choose to use console commands. i completely would get if the devs locked the console only for multiplayer, but why a total hard lock. once i complete the story and missions, sandrock will feel like a massive chore if i have to continue grinding just to do the things i actually want to be doing. 

tldr: sandrock now feels like a sandbox game without the sandbox mode. like playing in a sandbox without sand or attempting to swim in a pool without water. i can't recommend sandrock once more unless dev console is returned.


aside from that discrepancy, have some bullet points.

positive:

1.) very pretty game world, the town of sandrock and her people feel rich and enticing. although, diversity is what makes the world appealing, but that mostly ends if you stray any significant distance away from town or your workshop.

2.)romance feature in sandrock gets more ""worth it"" points compared to portia. i romanced unsuur, and his character arc was adorable and had me go from finding him irrelevant to him seeming like a wholesome, goofy character who i can strongly relate to. i cry when i see him in a sad or embarrassing sitch.

3.) house building. coming from a lifelong sims fanatic, sandrock's home building feature draws me in despite it having a sort of learning curve. i'm very dependent on mouse/keyboard when in building games, so its of note that sandrock's house builder catches my attention at all.

negative:

1.) despite its pastel-toned cartoonish vibe, sandrock can feel too immersive. grinding never gets genuinely less dreadful. machines require both water and fuel to operate, adding an extra thing to worry about despite adding nothing of value to the game. requiring fuel makes sense in a game like this, it serves as a subtle tactic to get the player to be actively involved in their workshop. requiring water as well looks good in terms of world design, but serves no purpose otherwise that fuel requirement wasn't already achieving.

2.) sandrock feels like a rich, vibrant world. sandrock also feels just as empty as it does to visit earth in starfield.  aside from story purposes, i felt no eagerness to explore new map areas. i rarely leave the confines of my workshop or the town itself. when i bought sandrock, the idea of it taking place in a desert allured me, it rendered in me that eager feeling to see what's out there. but after seeing what's ""out there"", i'm left feeling dissapointed that there wasn't more. no personality or variation in new map spaces. generally, ""all's the same"".",19735

2023-11-05,"mixed review while i do enjoy it has the same problems i had with portia. the pacing is really slow and the map tho big it feels extremely empty, there’s a lot of walking back and forth with nothing around, easy fix would be to make the town buildings smaller and closer together. there’s no need for the amount of space and scale, it is a town in the middle of nowhere with limited water after all.",19735
2023-11-05,"the first sequel in years to not disappoint me.

better than portia in every way, and i'm having a lot of fun.
- much higher production quality, as is apparent from cutscenes, voice acting, artwork, character designs, quests, writing, etc.
- many much appreciated qol improvements, such as being able to pet multiple farm animals at once.
- combat has been markedly improved (thank god), but still nothing to write home about.
- production loop has been vastly improved. no longer will your machines run 24/7 producing bronze plates. commissions and constructions ask for varied items in reasonably quantities.
- home customization has been introduced, letting you create whatever size and layout you like.

critiques:
- character customization is very basic, unfortunately.
- fishing! fish variety has been vastly trimmed down, and you're no longer incentivized to catch one of every fish; the fish tank is gone.
- many tooltips are holdovers from beta and therefore now inaccurate.
- 60 hours in and i have had 2 bugs that forced me to restart the client.
- inconsistencies in certain cutscenes.
- distinct lack of diversity in romanceable women. for men there's skinny dudes, chunky dudes, big dudes, older dudes, fem dudes, but for women there's only skinny young lady. some big girls or older ladies would have been nice.",19735
2023-11-05,"decent game, but not ready for full release. i would recommend it once the issues are fixed.
two most annoying issues:
1. loading performance is terrible - loading a save or entering ruins takes minutes!
2. machines become dusted, but no actual dust is visible and there's no way to clean them - it's a known issue, and still has not been fixed (there's a workaround, but that's not good enough - fix your game!)",19735
2023-11-05,"i absolutely love this game. previously my favourite farming game was portia, now it's sandrock. it's such an amazing game that its existence makes me happy.
let me explain: i play a lot of farming games and i love the genre. many of them share a number of common flaws however, such as shallow characters, weak non-farming mechanics, quest design that feels like chore. not in sandrock (or portia, for that matter)! the characters interact with each other in believable and lively ways. it's no longer that the player is the only thing that exists to them. everyone comes together to build a town and the player is only one small part of it. this makes the quests so much more believable.
what really impressed me was the way it differs from/improves upon portia. portia did a lot of things very well, but sandrock didn't just take those mechanics unchanged. instead, sandrock improved upon every little thing in portia that bothered me (e.g. the guns were a bit weak in portia; they're totally viable in sandrock) and also refreshed other aspects (e.g. i liked the fishing mini game in portia; sandrock changed the mini game but it's equally entertaining) so that series fans like me aren't bored.
the way the multiplayer is implemented is also quite good.
overall, i just love the thought and care the devs have put in this game. it's incredibly rare nowadays to see a game in a popular genre where the devs didn't settle for easy formulas and past success, but continue to improve. love everything about this game!",19735
2023-11-05,"i picked up my time at sandrock as soon as it was available in early access. i enjoyed my time at portia and was excited to jump into this and be along for the development ride. if you enjoyed portia and haven't picked this up yet, i'd highly suggest you do so, you won't be disappointed.

i'm not much of a reviewer so he's my highlights.

good

-the visuals-the visual presentation is great. the style they started with in portia was kept for sandrock and tightened, cleaned, and it really pops. a straight improvement from its predecessor.

-characters-the characters fit with the world that these games take place in. goofballs on the one hand but can be serious on the other. it does a good job of portraying a tight knit group that has history with each other and rely on each other. the vas do a good job and you never really feel like its being phoned in.

-story-so, you've played some harvest moon games, stardew valley, and similar games...whelp, you know what kind of story you're getting into. that's not a bad thing though, we love those stories and that's why we scoop games like these up because while every story in these style of games has a similar foundation what's built on top of it gives us an insight into the biggest character in these games, the town. the town is a character all its own, a combination of its past, present, environment, and the characters living in, around, or otherwise interacting with it throughout the story. it takes on a life of its own and sandrock, as a town/character, is fun to see develop.

-qol-there were so many improvements to make life much easier in sandrock, it would almost make portia a little harder to go back to. but i very much appreciate everything they implemented in sandrock to make a builders life easier when it comes to making your shop hum along and get those contracts done. something a portia player can appreciate more than a newbie but a thumbs up from me.

bad

let me preface this by saying i'm not a tech savvy man, what you know about the power of rigs and all of the bells and whistles is probably beyond me so take this short section of bad with a grain of salt, your results may vary.

when i'd start up the game, while my load times were rather quick when i'd get into the game it could take a solid minute, at max, for the world to load everything. if i got into the game and i was loading in while in the house, that was fine but once i left the house or would load into a game that had me outside there could be a bit of a wait for things to load. i never found it a terrible thing but a rig that's a little on the lower end might have more of an issue.

the other thing i noticed is that if i played for a block of 3-4 hours in a row i could start to experience slowdown that became much more significant as the time would go on and control inputs would also be laggy. a couple times character path-finding became erratic and would be my prompt to log off. i haven't done blocks like that in a while and so i don't know if it's a concern and it may have just been my machine but i did experience that.",19735

2023-11-05,"man this game is addicting. the gameplay, the balance, the bodies, i just want pen to rawdog me",19735
2023-11-05,"as of right now, the game has some major issues. it seems to run just fine, but the problem it has is loading everything in. moving to a new area takes sometimes up to 30 seconds for the loading screen. then when the new area finally loads in, it needs to load the objects in the environment, your items, and even the ui. just trying to open the pause menu so i can save has sometimes taken 20 minutes to load (and even then, i still have to wait even longer for the buttons in the menu to start working).

i enjoyed the first game well enough, so i imagine that this one will be good as well once they figure out how to improve these issues. until then, the frustration outweighs the fun in its current state.",19735

2023-11-05,"as massive fan of portia, bought this one first day of ea and played it from time to time at various states of it's beta.
at ea launch game had terrible loading time and optimisation issues and since then devs went miles to improve it, up to the point it works smoothly like portia while being massively above it terms of graphics and stuff.

compared with mtap the game feels better in every possible direction, devs listened to their playerbase and adapted the game as much as possible and so far it's one of the best ""life sim"" games on market, easily equal to legendary stardew valley itself.

if you liked the first game - rest assured, it's ""the same but better"". much better.
so better that paying full price feels not enough assuming the amount of effort and love devs put into this game.
heavily recommending to any fan of the genre. good stuff.",19735
2023-11-05,absolute gem. i've been playing for 10 straight hours and didn't even notice.,19735

2023-11-05,"dont listen to thoses bad reviews, experience the game yourself you can tell pathea spent alot of their time for wonderful quests and chill-but-not-boring game play, 5-stars cozy farming sim game !!!",19735

2023-11-04,"took everything i loved about my time at portia and just made everything better, all of the characters in this story are so much fun and i love them all. i find myself thinking about the little quotes at work and how much i just want to come back to this game! love this game with all my heart! cowboy hot.",16806
2023-11-04,"great follow up to my time at portia.  i was skeptical at the beginning with the recycling mechanisms at the beginning and the scarcity of some resources, but the game is a blast and definitely captures the same feeling as portia.",16806
2023-11-04,"so far game play and everything else is very appealing. 
worth it really. its the rpg every one wanted",16806
2023-11-04,enjoyed my time portia this next installment is in improvement in every category combat still meh but its better va is good character design is good runs smooth not bugs or crashes 14 hrs in i recommend,16806
2023-11-04,this game is an improvement to my time at portia and your home is much closer to the shops and the mining as well.,16806
2023-11-05,"i purchased the game a few days before the official release, from an online recommendation, and i can honesty say that this is the best farm sim i've ever played. it improves on so many quality of life issues that i've experienced with other farming sims. being able to alter how quickly the time of day passes by and also having villagers that actually have depth to their characterization, voice acting and updated dialog that matches the game's story progression, it's a breath of fresh air. i love that villagers actually react to weather conditions, change their form of dress to suit the weather, and don't just stand outside like robots as if it were a regular sunny day. love the freedom and flexibility provided by designing your character's house and farmland. i also love the diversity in the cast of characters, they don't all look like they have the exact same cookie cutter anime body shape. 

also, being able to talk to npcs while still mounted on your horse, was a feature i was relived to see in this game. i cannot tell you how annoying it was playing games like harvest moon and having to get off your mount just to talk to someone, then jump back on your mount every single time. being able to access all storage boxes from a single storage unit, being able to complete fetch quest assignments with items that you're not carrying with you at the time, but are still in your storge inventory is also a wonderful addition. the animals in the game, whether they be farm animals or wild animals that you fight for exp have their own unique charm to them. love the fact that you can upgrade your horse and take photos with it. and the horse gallop and leaping animations are wonderful. 

i currently play this game on the steam deck and it's been a great experience. camera felt a little wonky at first, had to set the x and y camera sensitivity to 15 and the aim sensitivity to 40 for it to feel better on steam deck, so not sure if the defaults camera setting was set up for keyboard. other than a few floating foliage plants in the air, and utensils not appearing in an npc's hand while eating, the game has ran near prefectly on my steam deck. 

cannot wait for any future dlc planned by this dev. would love to see possibly mounted combat, or updated pets, enemy monsters, townsfolk, or farm animals. or having a game in the future where you can choose to be an antagonist or protagonist would be a welcome to see. my only complaint would be during character customization, i wish the character could have more body shape options then just looking like a stick. when you're a woman, it's a little frustrating not being able to give your character a figure or hips. but other than that, i have no other complaints about the game. i truly hope other developers can see the success of this franchise and use it as an example to improve theirs as well. like iron sharpening iron.",19735
2023-11-04,"as a player that played my time at portia before , sandrock really do improve in terms of content and quality of life . for new players that had not touch portia before , sandrock might be overwhelming for the amount of things it threw at you first . however once u get used to it , thats where the fun in sandrock starts .though , most of us probably would be cursing whenever a certain weather arrives especially if we had things we wanna do on that day ...ahh my items got blown away!!! come backkkkk!!!!!",16806
2023-11-04,"i loved sandrock during early access and didn't have any problems. now in since launch i am getting bsod and the game crashes my entire system after playing (sometimes as quickly as 10min after launch). i did email their q/a and i am hoping that they'll get these addressed, but for now i'd avoid buying until these major crashes get fixed (yes, this is post ""crashfix"" yesterday).",16806
2023-11-04,"nintendo should take notes, this game is absolutely amazing. if you have been searching for a building game for years and have yet to find a good one to scratch that itch, you have found the right game. i promise you won't be disappointed. use your 2 hour window to test the game and if you don't like it just refund it, but i can guarantee you won't want to refund it because it is amazing!",16806
2023-11-04,"another fantastic game! i adored my time at portia, and i'm loving sandrock so far too. the similarities are nice to see but still brings enough differences to make it unique! the character art is adorable and i love the variety.  there's so much more for me to explore and i can't wait to play more.",16806
2023-11-04,i love the release ! i love all the new updates! i have spent over 700 hours on it so far and would recommend this game to anyone who asks about it.. in fact i have to several people who also ended up picking up the game and also loved it! i love everything about it. i am a fan of the series !,16806
2023-11-04,i had to put my bg3 play through on pause because i can't put this down 10/10,16806
2023-11-04,"this game has been honestly really enjoyable overall. i played it on the early access at first and then put the game down until release and i'm impressed by the amount of content it has now compared to when i first tried it out. i really enjoy all the building, crafting, gathering etc. 

the game makes me feel like i'm always in a race against time, on the clock tick tock gotta go fast, but after a while i realized it really dsnt matter if you just chill out and take your time. missing some of the daily missions is perfectly fine and just exploring at your own pace is not a problem at all. of course, the nature of the daily cycle mixed with the daily contracts adds this feeling of being in a rush to do everything you can do within a single day. 

the combat and gearing is very simple but its still a part of the game i did enjoy. don't expect like difficult combat, but its still satisfying to see my damage grow as i get levels and upgrade my gear to purple + highest item level in the machines.

i hit max character level and max level workshop in multiplayer and i still have places to explore, missions to complete and new things to craft/build.",16806
2023-11-04,absolutely fun..! it feels like home :),16806

2023-11-03,"engaging story line and fun gameplay! the graphics are big upgrade from my time at portia. if you are a fan of farming sims and have played stardew valley and coral island, then you will love this game. many hours of fun and the combat is also a big upgrade.",11835
2023-11-04,"a marked improvement over its predecessor in many points. it feels much more polished and got rid of a lot of the jank that still made portia feel like a bit of a prototype.
the setting is more interesting as well. the town of sandrock is pretty much dying in the beginning of the game, and getting it back to the right path, even bringing back a bit of green to the desert in later stages, feels pretty satisfying.",16806

2023-11-04,"due to their recent disgusting attitude towards gog players (announcing the game on gog, distributing streamer keys, and now pulling back from gog), they have lost me as a customer.

2023-11-04,"this game has crafting, exploring, fishing, farming, and a fulfilling cozy plot in spite of the desert aesthetics. the game developers have been very responsive to feedback and quick to send out patches throughout the entire process. i've started a new game with the 1.0 release and am enjoying seeing the game play out how it is meant to be.",16806
2023-11-04,if you enjoyed portia it's more of the same. considering portia already took a ton of hours and this one is even bigger i'm not sure yet if that is a good thing or not. so far it's a pretty addictive formula; you're constantly trying to squeeze in as much as you can in each day which keeps you engaged. i'll try and update this review when i'm closer to finishing/finished.,16806

very engaging story and event plus with fully voice acted character too.most life don't even have voice acted character.this game show to passion developer to create great life simulation game.this game is improvement from portia in every way possible.

negative:
outside story nothing much to do at endgame since pretty much max the commission already
no more interaction between characters and player when you max out and do all their quest (beside they asking to date\play)
character like ernest / amirah /owen have almost no interaction at all with player

9/10 best life sim i played since sims 3",16806

get wood scraps whenever you see them (chests!), 
get some water improvements from tech tree, 
everyday eat twice at the saloon (start with discounted meals).",16806
2023-11-04,"came into sandrock as a big my time at portia aficionado and as many have said, fans of the latter will find a lot to love in this title.

mtas has brought [i] huge [/i] improvements in the quality-of-life department, along with gorgeous visuals and a new multiplayer mode to boot. recent updates have really fleshed out npc stories and brought the depth of character i loved in mtap, and it's been wonderful to watch this game come to life over the course of its early access period.

for newcomers: the ""my time"" series stands out to me as a life sim that has it all, from crafting and farming to romance and combat, with robust systems that make it all enjoyable to play - and my time at sandrock is no different.

2023-11-03,"actually so far its been fun, combat feels fun, it seems like it will have quite the grind to it but all and all ive had nothing but fun yet",11835
2023-11-04,"basically portia in the desert.  it looks better and there's a lot more polish, and more importantly there's a number of qol improvements.  things like the game automatically taking things from your storage containers, sprint toggle, fast travel points being there from the start, etc.  the perk tree is also far more useful this time around.  the characters seem a little more interesting this time as well.  i still like the core gameplay concept more than most farming sims, as your money comes from doing commissions rather than just mass producing whatever is valuable and throwing it into a box.

that said there's still some issues from the first game, the biggest being the mobile game timers on all the crafting.  i sure do enjoy having to wait 10+ minutes of real life time to smelt some bars, and then another 5-10 minutes to turn those into whatever other parts your need.  you just kind of have to make 4-5 of each production machine, but then of course that means more resource gathering to fuel them.  just like the first game, a mod to make crafting faster would cut the game length in half.  the combat also hasn't improved at all.  you still just mash attack and do a dodge roll every so often, and that's it.  there's an armour break system now, but it gets trivialised once you find the '+1 break' skill on the perk tree and murder everything in seconds.

if you need a busywork sim game to fill your time, this is still a decent improvement on the first one.  there's lots and lots of stuff to do, it's a chill game genre,  and it's entertaining enough to overlook most of the flaws.",16806
2023-11-03,"i played my time in portia and couldn't get into it. but after some rave reviews, i decided to give this one a chance and boy am i glad i did! my time at sandrock is more approachable than my time at portia and i am really enjoying it! the graphics, combat, crafting, mining and gathering are all very enjoyable! this is like stardew valley but way less farming and more building. i highly recommend it!",11835
2023-11-03,"fun game, better than my time at portia in every way",11835
2023-11-03,"my time at sandrock have been a captivating and immersive gaming experience. from the moment i set foot in this post-apocalyptic world, i was drawn into its rich narrative, extensive crafting system, and the challenges it presented.

the landscape of sandrock is a visual treat, with its desolate beauty and a sense of exploration that kept me engaged for hours on end. the attention to detail in the environment and the variety of biomes made every journey exciting, whether i was traversing the  wastelands or navigating the mysterious ruins.

the crafting system is where sandrock truly shines. with a wide array of resources to gather and a plethora of blueprints to discover, i was constantly motivated to experiment and create new items, from weapons and tools to cozy furnishings for my humble abode. the feeling of progress as i upgraded my workshop and expanded my capabilities was incredibly rewarding.

the interactions with the colorful cast of characters in sandrock added depth to the story and provided a sense of community in an otherwise harsh world. building relationships with the townsfolk was an enjoyable aspect of the game, and their unique personalities and quests brought the game world to life.

while my time at sandrock was largely enjoyable, there were occasional technical hiccups and performance issues that could be frustrating. however, the frequent updates from the developers gave me hope that these issues would be resolved over time.

in conclusion, my 150 hours at sandrock have been a delightful adventure. the combination of exploration, crafting, and storytelling in this unique post-apocalyptic world made it a memorable gaming experience, and i look forward to further updates and improvements as i continue to explore and build in this engaging sandbox world.",11835

[b] this is just my personal opinion, and opinions may differ from one person to another, and this is normal [/b]",11835
2023-11-03,"my time at portia was already a great game with a lot of interesting and fun ideas, but this new game, just got most of the (many) clunky bits from the original title, applied a shiny new coat of beautiful paint over them, fixed most of the issues, added a ton of qol improvements and focused on being a fleshed fun experience with hours upon hours of content. and even then, they also managed to slap multiplayer and coop mode, too!

for the price, this is truly a gem that will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours. this is now the equivalent of stardew valley on 3d, with its own ideas and style.

just a fun, campy and wholesome experience that delivers what it promises.

if you liked portia, or any other similar game, you will surely enjoy your time in sandrock!

more games like this, please!",11835
2023-11-03,so far so good,11835
2023-11-03,this game is well done and very addicting especially once you find your rhythm of crafting and gathering. probably the best feature of the game is how they handle inventory and storage. you can craft at any worktable/machine from items that are in any chests and you can turn in quests anywhere on the map with items that are in your chests at home. you can also push a button to store and sort items from your inventory into matching items that are in any of your chests. this is the best qol feature of the game imo since inventory management in other games is a pain so i'm glad sandrock is doing it right.,11835
2023-11-03,"so good so far. could use a graphic overhaul but honestly, its been so good so far. my only problem at the beginning with getting the deluxe ed was i had no room to put anything! i had to make so many chests. i'm not mad about it, but it definitely delayed a true start xd if you like farming sims with a lot of oomf, my time at sandrock is the play",11835
2023-11-03,"great game with amazing concepts. different from your average building game. there's tons to do and explore. just when you think that you are all caught up, you go to the next day and there's even more. the progression is fantastic, and you always feel like everything you do is meaningful. highly recommend.",11835

enjoy characters that make you think you might be a bully on the inside and dialouge written by 2 guys that went to the same comedy course together. voice acted characters that will make you feel like the only real person in a universe full of robots are here too to spruce up your free time and welcome you to your shack far outside of city bounds because no way in hell are they sharing space with your filthy ass.

there are many things to do! spend your time recycling wood, recycling stone, recycling metal and even recycling rubber. ask other inhabitants of sandrock to join you in any of the over 1 activities on offer. become a neet strategist as you attempt to figure out how half the seasonal event work. give up and recycle wood again! exciting!!!

now if you'll excuse me i have to pay out of pocket for a new water tower less we all die of dehydration within the next week and the church zealots that rule this town do not hand out credit even for life threatening disasters that affect all of us. don't you dare ever ask for anything for any goverment contracts.

enjoy. 8/10 (i really do like it. i'm dating the divorced single mom it makes up for everything.)",11835
2023-11-03,so far the overall game is great. just as you start to get bored doing basically the same thing over and over there's something new that happens. bringing you back into the game. i do wish there were more choice and romance interactions (times that the hearts come up in conversations). but other than that it's a great game. it's right up there with stardew valley for me so thank you.,11835
2023-11-03,played the 1st game loved it so tried this out definitely a upgrade. the world changes more compared to the 1st game. loved it. good game.,11835

2023-11-03,"this game is something else. so comfy and relaxing to play, but delivers great story, which often isn't a thing for this type of relaxing games. plot twists are very well written and genuinely surprising, i really envy people who are going to experience them for the first time. romance stuff is, in most part, also very good. there are some shortcoming with few of the characters, but i believe it can be improved and more content can be added.
overall, i played it for 750 hours and i can't wait to play for twice, thrice and even more",11835

2023-11-03,"they took everything about portia and turned it up to 11.

a wide variety of people in town. so many personalities. they play off of each other to make it feel like it's a real interaction. there are disagreements where both sides aren't wrong. there are little things that drive the characters forward. intrigue. a history!

yes, i'm a bit biased. i've been playing the early access game for a long time. watching this grow from a concept to an actual fully fleshed out game has been a lot of fun. playing it is even more so. :)",11835
2023-11-03,"i  played my time at portia and really enjoyed it and got sandrock early access. don't be fooled by the ridiculous day 1 cosmetic dlc packs the game itself is actually decent. can't say anything about multiplayer since i don't have any friends. only problem is pretty much universal with every game of this genre: a lot of dialogue can, should and was not trimmed off.",11835
2023-11-03,"imagine a kickstarted, crowdfunded ea-game that promised full online co-op campaign via description, steam-tags and all sorts of initial suggerence only to knowingly double-down after the fact with the main excuse of ""oh mp kinda hard/difficult and we 'forgot' to technically design/implement around mp as a foundation of the game... but thx for your money! kthxbye :) o/""

do not buy this game if you expect full co-op story campaign from it's ""online co-op"" in steam tags. i'd also strongly recommend against buying this game if you oppose to false advertising and intentional/malevolent business practices.

you can't seriously expect anyone to believe gamedevs/publishers who clearly are able to create and publish a full-fledged aaa-game... to having ""misunderstood"" or ""forgotten"" the technical and meta-linguistic requirements and meaning of full... online... co-op, multiplayer campaign.

buy the game after the fact/release if you're a gullible clown that enjoys being scammed, and sitting in some moronic, watered-down ""mp co-op mode"" that mainly stands as a testament for devs+publisher to have an ""excuse"" or marginal ""validity"" for their initial false advertisement and to keep their lovely, little ""online co-op"" tag on steam.

another excuse they came up with were ""linguistic"" or ""cultural"" difficulties and ""misunderstandings"". like who are you going to fool. it's not that ""full mp co-op story campaign"" is a completely new genre or ""term"". not much to see here: just a bunch 'o negative, scumming business-clowns that cannot experience love or empathy.",11835
2023-11-03,"185 hours. this was the total hours i played on this game while it was still on early access and now that my time at sandrock is officially released this will easily double. i play a ton of farming/building/life sims but never quite as much as i have for this one (barring animal crossing which i feel is in a sub genre of it's own when it comes to sim games because of its real life time shenanigans).

the gameplay loop is addictive and will definitely give you that ""just one more day"" feeling in games like this one. if you ever played my time at portia (which i also have over 100 hours on) then let me just say that this one is better in every single aspect. the environment is much different than the storybook style that portia has. you live in a harsh dessert and very much feels like starved for important resources like water (water is very important in this game) but i feel like seeing it transform with your help as the new ""builder"" makes it feel all the more rewarding. 

the npcs feel very engaging and alive and react based on interactions you have with them (i had one npc propose to start dating that i had to turn down and even though they seem to have taken the rejection well, you can still feel the heartbreak in the rejection with the ensuing dialogue you get from them when you try to talk to them again the following days). and yes! reverse proposals are a thing!

the storyline is probably one of the best ones i have seen in all the games i played in this genre. it pushes you to keep getting the resources and fulfilling the requests as soon as you can to see what happens next.

now though there is a bit of farming, the main focus of the game is more on building the town and creating the things needed for said town building. from stage displays, mining lifts, ""bus stops"" to even having to plant flowers and crafting benches to beautify the town-these are responsibilities that fall on you as the builder.

there are so many other great things to be said about my time at sandrock but i will say as someone who has stardew valley near and dear to my heart (i have 100% that game on my switch like twice already), that this is probably the only game so far that can rival the kind of enjoyment and satisfaction that stardew gives. honestly, even more so.",11835

2023-11-03,i love this game been playing since ea and i can't wait to finally play the full story. when i first started playing i didn't think i would love it as much as i do. some of the game mechanics were different so for me there was little bit of an adjustment from portia. i loved my time at portia and i have had multiple replays on pc and ps5 and this game is definitely looking like it will be the same way. this series is definitely 10/10. so if you haven't played it you definitely need to be. my only thing i don't love is that when building your house/workshop everything is separate i do like that you can customize it pretty much however you want but make sure you know where you want to put it because moving it is kind of a pain.,11835

2023-11-03,"my time at sandrock is a life simulator game about being an combat engineer-farmer in a post-apocalyptic arid desert setting where water is a scarcity. if you've played the previous game in the series, my time at sandrock is superior in every single way except perhaps the price tag and in the rare category of ""games with quality and originality from a chinese developer"".

unlike the previous game in the series, the game has little focus on time limits and is generally a laid-back experience focused a little more on storytelling than on repetitive routine actions. you build devices, conduct repairs, decorate your home, ingratiate yourself to other townsfolk - it's tempting to compare it to stardew valley, however i find this somewhat inaccurate because stardew valley has little in the way of interesting writing, characterisation, nor a plotline to keep me engaged in it as it relies heavily on a modding community for such content.

this writing and characterisation successfully caters to both children and adults - characters aren't particularly complex in personality, however, the dialogue has an abundance of dry wit, sarcasm and humour to lampoon the moral lessons it's trying to impart; this cushions the irritation that adults may experience when being preached to about what they would consider as obvious lessons in responsibility such as ""don't waste water"", ""don't monopolise resources"", ""don't behave like a psychopath"".

nowhere is this more apparent than in quests where saturday-morning-cartoon npcs blithely remark on and lampshade their anti-social behaviour before you deal with them in a series of increasingly surreal methods. this makes the game worth playing for the comedic nonsensical and satirical value alone. 

the cast of characters to interact with is amazingly diverse, and not in an annoyingly forced and hackneyed way, but in personality too. many of them have humourous character flaws, such as the sheriff's remarkably feckless and cavalier attitude toward due process; or his devoted understudy, who rather uniquely portrays autism in an endearing and positive light. i did not once feel that the game was overtly trying to advance a political nor social agenda on the player, which is often the case with other offerings in this genre.

it was a very wise decision to adopt this writing style as the story may have come off heavy-handed and sententious/preachy otherwise. this character building is absolutely unmatched by any other life simulator game i have ever played. the game even gives you the freedom to be as antisocial, spiteful and negative as you want, although this will obviously alienate yourself from the town community.

if you're looking to wind down from an exhausting day, i can think of few better games to play. if you're looking for a challenging and stressful skill-based game however, you may want to look elsewhere. my biggest regret is that i've finished most of it and that i'm going to have to wait a few more years for a sequel in order to see where the world's storyline is going next.",11835
2023-11-03,it's an improvement in every way over the first game.,11835
2023-11-03,"love love love  this game. definitely my favourite game! performance can be a little bit off sometimes, but the story and world building more than make up for it for me! some very appreciated quality of life improvements over the previous game in the series. highly recommend this game if you like other farming/life sims",11835

2023-11-03,"the my time game series is surely improving throughout the games that they've released. portia was amazingly beautiful but sandrock gave an incredible gameplay experience. first off, the npcs are gorgeous physically and personality wise. the story line is incredible, i mean i've been expecting duvos invasion but not like what i've experience in sandrock. the plot twist was quite unpredictable because i've been eyeing 1 character and it turned out that he/she was just a puppet lol and the mastermind is a different npc all along. and logan ughh, logan. i don't think i need to elaborate that further. i am hoping for an expansion pass since there are certain areas of the map that are present but not currently explorable. 

p.s. automatically bought your dlc because the new pet is cute and the new outfit is cute as well. i hope you can add npc outfit dlcs just like in portia coz i'd like to see logan in a different perspective *wink wink.",11835

you do not need to have played my time at portia to play sandrock is stands alone.

plays well with either mouse and keyboard or controller (i used controller)

the community you live and work in will dynamically change over the course of the story, people will come and go from town, and everyone has something to say about major story beats.",11835

it was great being back in the my time world and i enjoyed playing it, even though certain aspects of the game i wish were left out (*cough*, woke crap, *cough*).  they actually toned it down for full release which i was happy to see because during the early access it was just too much in your face.  now it is more of an option if you want it, but not ""in your face"" unless you initiate.  good change because we aren't all wanting the same things out of our happy games.",11835
2023-11-02,"graphics - very good but not amazing (edit - they added a new anti aliasing option in 1.0 which is much better!) it is pretty well optimised and loads very fast.
gameplay - great life/farming/building sim. it's not the best in all of its design choices, however, it has an original premise and setting and i have enjoyed my time with it very much as someone who loves games like stardew valley/harvest moon/story of seasons. the combat, while greatly improved from the first game, is still not the best and i tend to not bother with much unless there's items i need. the focus of this game is building and everything else is a bonus.
voice acting - ranges from good to poor. this is probably the weakest aspect of the game for me along with some of the writing.
audio - generally good music and sfx (edit - they improved a lot of the sounds in 1.0 so my complain in this area is gone).

in general it is an great game from devs that care and have kept the community up to date through the early access period. although not perfect, if you liked my time at portia this is better in every way.",7446
2023-11-02,"fantastic casual game if you like stardew valley, harvest moon, or even their other game my time at portia. what i like in particular is that even though it shares the same feel as portia the theme and mechanics are pretty different. there's more emphasis on scavenging, exploring, and looting relics. similar gameplay loop of using your scavenged parts to build better machinery, but it feels a lot more fleshed out. (combat is more polished too) definitely check it out if you like these kinds of progression/township types of games!",7446

2023-11-02,"psa: if you want to play both portia and sandrock, play portia first! the added qol in sandrock makes backtracking to that game somewhat difficult.

the ""my time at..."" series is something truly special. i picked this one up on a sale iirc, back when the story ended with the destruction of the water tower, so i´ve had this game for a while now. kept starting over every time they added a new big feature and am pumped to finally play the full version, as soon as my  unbelievably slow internet connection is finally done downloading.

is this a good game? heck yeah. i can´t remember how many times i only wanted to finish that one request or finish building that one machine and ended up playing until 4am. the characters are all uniquely loveable, even characters i´d absolutely hate in real life (looking at you, arvio...), the quests will keep you going for a long time and the graphics are that beautiful cozy comic style that makes you believe that everything will be alright in the world.

2023-11-02,"this game is very enjoyable. fans of portia will definitely have a good time telling a new story about their time in the ""my time"" universe, but it's still alot of fun if u haven't played my time at portia. i particularly appreciated the sneaky little overlap hints about there being ""another star builder"" in portia ;). sandrock offers a bunch of new fun features like being able to build your house sims-style, and has a very satisfying amount of quests, side quests, and town events. the characters are dynamic, have decent storylines, and are voiced by some talented voice actors. it's easy to get attached. i loved being able to respond to letters in the mail, and feeling like i had a little more input over how i interacted with the city. and not for nothing, my ego enjoyed the good stroking that it got from a town that recognized me as it's heroine and awarded me thusly; something that i felt like i lacked when in portia. i, of course, have my preferences and complaints, but that's only because i love this game/series sooo much that too much is not nearly enough! this is a semi-cozy game, with lots to do and lots to see and it's very obvious that the devs put their hearts and souls into it. i can't wait to see what the ""my time"" gang has next for us! play this! now! it's a good time ^_^",7446

one thing i wanted to mention is an accessibility(?) feature. i'm not disabled, so i can't comment on that, but i have carpel instability in both hands which makes a lot of typing and button pressing painful after a long time. so having the auto-run feature is huge to me. god it really saves my life. controller or pc, even holding the joystick will hurt so pc is better with auto run. not many games offer this feature (stardew does not!) so it really helps me out. thanks devs!!!!!!",7446

2023-11-02,"an excellent game.

i took a chance on it during ea since it was nothing like the typical game i would play, (survival, mmos, shooters, etc.) and totally loved it.

the cartooniness can be misleading, it's actually quite a complex game, sort of a mashup of a rpg, singleplayer open world, farming/builder game with interesting npcs and relationships with them.

i see some power-gamer's whining about not having enough stamina to mine the entire world in a day, but they simply have not learned how to play yet.

the key to pacing your game play is based on how quickly you advance the main story quest line. meaning slow down!
if you want to mine more, build, explore, talk to npcs, and feel like you need to catch up, simply don't do the main story quests for a few days, or as long as you want. you control it completely. do not rush the main story quests.

power gamers have to rush everything. this is not that type of experience. slow down and enjoy the journey.",7446

2023-11-02,"it's a good game, runs smooth, story's about as good as a chinese company can make and then half-bake into english. gameplay loop is satisfying as well, with either farming and gathering or combat, crafting, building. the world is... well, about as nice as a desert can be, and you can make it a bit less... desert-y by decorating, at least your plot of land, your house, your farms. character customization is..... decent. base models are expandable enough, plus you can swap out clothes pretty easily, if not a little... grindy, and there's a pretty decent variety as far as things go, nothing groundbreaking but at least nice enough.
however.
we all knew the price was going to hike up a bit on full release, but in addition to that, they waited until after release to drop all the dlc, a very disappointing half-step that the players definitely should have known better about before the game released. if i'd known there was gonna be dlc aafter release, i would have thought twice about even getting it. however, honestly it's still a really solid package, and some dinky cosmetics aren't going to really make or break your gameplay in most cases.
the game is probably a 7/10, it would have been an 8, however i'm not one to take this game's early-access transition dlc hat-trick lightly.
if you like farming and gathering, decorating and just general life-simmery, i would recommend you get it at a discount, it's 40 usd on release but i would get it for 30 at most.

2023-11-02,"you can spend a lot of time in sandrock, that’s for sure. it’s pretty addictive in fact, but, like most addictions, ultimately just not that much fun…

interactions with townsfolks and monster fights are trite and repetitive, as are most other day-to-day activities: refuel and dust off your equipment, run from place to place (the lack of 'quick travel' becomes tiresome quickly, especially combined with the clunky navigation system), go eat to replenish your extremely limited stamina, desperately try to dig your way to much-needed resources, try to get home before you collapse, rinse, repeat.

much of the game revolves around crafting items within a time limit, but all of these have recursive (and therefore pretty much unforeseeable) dependencies, as well as ""you need this resource, but you can’t get that just yet"" scenarios, making the supposedly-cute grind-breaking interludes that are forced on you from time to time more stressful than anything.

in the end, i had to abandon sandrock because bugs prevented some progress-blocking missions from being completed, and i realized i just didn’t feel like starting a new game in an attempt to set things right. and not starting the game is the best advice i can give prospective players: unless you truly enjoy the 'cow clicking' genre, it’s best to look elsewhere.",7446

2023-11-02,"[h3]kickstarter scam & poor-quality writing[/h3]


i see why this game could make a good first impression to people who never heard of pathea and their games before. graphics and npcs are nice to look at. unfortunately, that’s all.  

gameplay 3/10
difficulty 2/10
graphics 6/10
audio 3/10
story 1/10
sensitivity when it comes to serious topics (trauma, disabilities, death) 0/10
dev support 0/10
false promises 10/10

there sure were lots of problems with their previous game, my time at portia, devs simply weren’t capable to handle resources and promised way too much. the result was and still is an unpolished game full of bugs and missing content for several dateable npcs. console ports are still a mess too, although team17 and pingle are out for several years now and it was all up to pathea after this. last update in 2021 caused more problems than it solved and even more than 2 years later, pathea did nothing but announce some switch performance update. no actual update, no word about problems like missing items, stuck npcs, unplayable missions or fixes for playstation or xbox. they abandoned both, pc and console ports to work on sandrock instead.

there were many promises to learn from previous mistakes with portia and that everything would get better with sandrock. spoiler; [spoiler]it did not.[/spoiler] 

as other negative reviews already pointed out; sandrock kickstarter ended up being a scam.
many people backed because of 100k multiplayer stretch goal, which was easily reached. during early access the multiplayer actually did have story content for a while, just as devs promised. later, they suddenly decided to backtrack and removed it. their excuse; once more bit off more than they could chew and backers just have to accept this. no content, no chance for refund. 

there were more false promises during and after kickstarter. some examples;
- announced timespan for backers to share exclusive content was shortened
- all dateable npcs getting same amount of content - no, it ended up being the same as in mtap
- fixing none working kickstarter dlc codes - not for me
- promise to fix sensitive content - no

even if ignoring all of these mentioned above, i can still not recommend this game. devs took their previous game mtap, added desert location, more generic graphics, some new features and a different writing style. 

while simple gameplay and low difficulty are quite fitting for this genre, their storytelling is unbearable. memes, movie quotes, references, breaking the 4th wall, primitive thirst traps and puns galore, devs admitting at discord to copy entire npcs from disney and others. a ref or joke once in a while is nice though it’s far too much in this case. sandrock feels more like a parody or browsing social media rather than diving into a game with reliable npcs. also, very often those jokes are out of place or go way too far. for example;[spoiler]
- fake kidnapping a traumatized man’s pet to get his attention
- some npc pretending to be disabled because being too lazy to work 
- npc, who is worried their family member might die after already losing another one, is portrayed as fire spitting monster
- making corpulent npc a joke by adding ridiculous amount of food to his room[/spoiler]

devs also came up with the weirdest excuses for missing quality. like saying not to add optional (lol) voice acting for main character because they don’t want to limit players’ vision of their avatar too much. well, they actually don’t mind limiting our vision by bringing mc’s parents and childhood friend to the game, which of course is a way bigger limitation. 

writers are showing a huge lack in sensitivity and even made fun of some players at reddit and discord who brought up their sincere concerns. this behavior is mostly unprofessional.

writing also suffers from missing consistency; plot, timeline, even entire npcs. especially recurring npcs from mtap. [spoiler]mint’s whole backstory and childhood were changed to promote qi, ginger became implausible careless, not following doctors’ advices anymore, gale prioritizes rather meaningless daily work over his precious daughter and leaves her behind, while the formerly cold, detached and standoffish gust now is loud, unjustifiably aggressive and violent to make players sympathize with director’s favorite npc fang, who is permanently portrayed as everyone’s victim.[/spoiler] which leads to another problem; playing favorites. if you’re not interested in sad novel trope fang or stereotype himbo logan, be aware your favorite npc doesn’t get much content since writers focus on those two heavily.

i gave pathea a chance and wanted to support their growth. there’s nothing wrong with making mistakes if you’re willing to learn from them and show process. quite disappointing, this isn’t the case with pathea and sandrock. same mistakes all over again and even adding new ones. this is why i can’t recommend this game.

2023-11-01,"i talked to a phone booth in the game that told me to leave a review with feedback, so i'm gonna do that!

this game's totally worth the asking price as-is, really elevates the farm life genre beyond stardew valley in pretty much every way (i loved stardew!), and offers a scintillating post-apocalyptic desert setting that feels really novel.

this game clearly has a lot to say about the way capital and a self-serving government can funnel money to prop up those who are already successful whilst leaving struggling communities to languish. there are tons of quests and side quests where characters ask if you can spot them money because the economy in sandrock is awful, and public servants will frequently lament the difficulty the town has getting government grants and the belief the residents should 'just move somewhere nicer' without regard for the town's unique culture or the financial hurdles one must jump over to be able to afford moving.

i'm still not done with the game's main story line even 80 hours in, but i'm excited to see how it further develops arguments between characters about the potential perils of technological advancement, because it seems like the game's religious faction is on the verge of lashing out at sandrock's local government for making use of scientific advancements to try and make the desert environment more habitable.

the game's premise also allows it to offer critique on world politics and modern society from the perspective of characters who are discovering information about us hundreds of years in the future. in the 'my time at' series' lore, to really simplify it, technology progressed with little oversight or regulation which made it trivially easy to start a world war that decimated most (all?) of the planet's surface and plunged the world into a new dark age, with people living underground until they were able to return to the surface and rebuild on top of the ruins.

i was surprised by the way this game tackles criticisms of the genre as being centered on mindless extractivism; the rationing of water from the local supply is a serious gameplay factory to account for, the logistical challenges of importing water from other towns is discussed frequently, and you're told as soon as you start the game that logging is illegal due to how few trees there are. plus there's a serious focus on scavenging for scraps and re-purposing those into materials.

this game really surprised me; i had kind of written it off because i thought the art style was a touch off-putting, but the narrative, character writing, and gameplay loops have all charmed and hooked me.

now, because that phone booth said the developers read reviews of the game for feedback, here's some very specific complaints i'd like addressed:

1. i'm in the summer of year two, partway through the bronco the kid quests, and i keep getting building commissions for items i cannot complete because i haven't met musa yet, which means i haven't gained access to the areas that unlock when he shows up in town. some of the commissions i've seen posted but can't complete are industrial machine tools, the advanced civil processor, and chromium daggers. i have these recipes already because i've been diligent about doing machine research with qi and buying recipes from the commerce guild, but i think the game should check to see whether the player has the ability to get the materials necessary to make something before it pops up as a commission.

2. after you first get the chance to express romantic interest in elsie, there's a line of dialogue where she declares 'i'm a legal adult' in frustration at the way her parents treat her. i appreciate the effort to make it clear she's not too young to ethically date, but she's very childish, and that line just makes her sound more childish. the mention of legality feels like a reassurance to the player, which doesn't make for good character dialog.

3. at some point, jumping with my camel started causing the game to freeze in the air for a half-second, after which it hits the ground and all four hoof-hitting-ground sounds play one right after the other. i swear the jumping animation used to be way smoother without that hitch and without the weird sound; i don't have performance issues in this game, so it's not lag as far as i can tell.

4. sometimes machines will get stuck saying they need to have the sand cleaned out of them, and no matter how many different positions or angles i try i cannot see a sand pile to remove with my duster. i found that picking the machine up and putting it back down fixes it temporarily, but i would prefer to just not have that issue, it's annoying having to finesse the position of a civil furnace that sits between two other furnaces.

5. i need storage to be sortable across all boxes instead of the 'sort' option just sorting that individual storage box, as well as the ability to search for an item in storage by name. i would also like for storage to always be accessible when you're gifting a character something. it's frustrating going through my 10? 12? large storage boxes, each with two pages of items to scroll through, especially since item names are only visible by using the left stick and going over every item.

6. finding relic parts for qi's side quests is too time consuming. i would prefer the quest-necessary relic pieces be located in chests in the ruins rather than in the dirt; i haven't found the scanner particularly effective at locating the quest pieces, so i've just been hitting every piece of dirt i can find on every floor hoping to uncover a relic piece eventually, which is extremely tedious when i also really need to move on to a new floor for the ores so i have the materials to complete my commissions.

7. the lack of tin scrap makes bronze more difficult to craft than stuff like chromium or manganese steel, and i'm not sure why that's the case given bronze is required for crafting so many different things.

8. there should be an option to turn on alerts for commissions that are going to expire that day. even if you're tracking your commissions that are due the soonest, you won't see when the commission expires on the main screen.

9. the shop interface should tell you whether clothing/accessories are better or worse than your current gear; i can't really compare my gear when it's all named something like 'stunt rider desert warrior visor' or 'bright defense team boots' since those names don't convey anything about their stats. it's also a struggle to remember my shirt provides, for example, '+136 health + 17 stamina +5% critical hit chance + negates poison status effects' when i'm in a shop going through a bunch of different shirts all with different stat buffs and effects.

10. add a setting that lets run be set as the default movement speed, please. using the 'toggle' doesn't work because there a bunch of annoying circumstances where the game toggles the player back to walking.

11. it's pretty easy to get stuck on obstacles in the sandrunning competition, and i lost a race because i got stuck under a boost pad ramp after hitting it from the side and had to forfeit to get out.

all of that said though, it's a great game, i'm looking forward to getting through the main story so i can go try my time at portia after this!",2157

2023-10-31,"in my opinion, it's a step up from portia in every way. i was never able to fully get into portia due to the building aspect being tedious when having to hold every item (small gripe, i know, but big enough to always hinder my playthroughs. i always end up quitting shortly after the cart building mission). not in sandrock. you can craft anything on the assembly station with materials straight from your chests. the quality of life upgrades to sandrock are very significant. the story is compelling, along with the large cast of diverse characters. unsuur is my himbo boyfriend, and i wouldn't trade him for any rock in the world. if you liked portia even just a little (or liked portia in theory but not practice like me), definitely give sandrock a try, because it's a  step up in every direction, and a perfect example of the devs fixing what needed to be fixed, without getting rid of what made it a good game in the first place.",1975

if you're feeling down or just want to spend some time in a positive place to get away from it all i can't recommend the 'my time' series enough.  they're really fun, really intuitive, and filled with diverse activities to keep you entertained.  there is a small time management element to the game like stardew valley or harvest moon so you feel just enough pressure to constantly keep the gears turning.

also did beta testing for both mp and sp - thank you pathea! - it has been an awesome experience that i've cherished. look forward to your next games in the my time series as they have only gotten better and more immersive. love the increased battles too, it has been a lot of fun. i tend to laugh and be a bit salty when battling, but it amuses my son as i hear him laughing at me from the next room then checking on me/what i'm doing. i'd stopped gaming for a long time, but portia got me back into it and i'm really happy i bought portia and kept going to experience sandrock. the series is only getting better and has so much potential. i have over 2500 hours in sandrock so far- and still feel i'm learning and experiencing new things as you can play the game in so many ways to keep it feeling fresh and yet familiar. thank you pathea for creating such a wonderful place to go each day and bring joy to daily life for so many of us.",2237

2023-10-27,"this is, no joke, probably my favorite game of all time. my time at portia was really good, but my time at sandrock is so so so so so good. it improves upon almost every single issue i had with portia (typically small issues like needing to hold the item to place it on the assembly station, etc) and the story is fun and compelling. the characters are more interesting and it is actually fun (and somewhat easier) to befriend them. they're all unique with interesting motivations and desires and the way they fit into the story makes it feel very natural. the game itself is super fun to play and rarely do i find myself with nothing to do. its well paced, extremely fun, and best of all, the game is super long! i have over 100 hours in my longest save file and i'm probably about halfway through the main story. i cannot recommend this game enough!!!",2237

2023-10-24,"my time at sandrock is a fun farm/life sandbox game and the sequel to my time at portia, which i also recommend.

good:

housing is a big factor when it comes to farming games, in this game you can customize your farm however you want, you can make your land mainly like a factory, farm or a beautiful homestead while not worrying about the other two as much.

commissions are the main money maker in the game that also rewards you with a good amount of relationship for certain characters and workshop reputation points. i highly recommend doing these daily and picking the most profitable ones as money is more important than the other two rewards.

saving midday is not a common thing to happen in farm/life sim games and that is why i really like this game, (portia doesn't have this feature). also that comes with midday saves is when you complete a quest or commission you auto save and have a quick save which is really handy to have.

there are a large variety of weapons, you can have 4 types of melee weapons, multiple ranged weapons and even some unique weapons that can't be crafted. each melee weapon has its own style and combo, whether it be daggers for fast but weak attacks or a greatsword which is slow but does a lot of damage.

decent:

relationships in this game follows every other farm/life sim game, there isn't a weekly limit but if you give an item too much they will like it less. the game is good at indicating if there is a relationship event going on as it will be marked on your map but the game doesn't really tell you if you even have events available for a character or if it is just end of current build.

there is a skill tree that you can do, but maxing out those 4 skills basically just fill up the entire tree leaving no real choice in the end. skill points are only gained by doing those specific skills. though i do think this idea is pretty neat, i will always prefer character levels rewarding skill points (portia did this).

farming had a step-up from portia, where you are able to place farming plots anywhere on your land instead of planter boxes. you can easily and efficiently plant items the higher the toolbox up to a 4x4 planting/watering/fertilizing area which is quick and easy. farming has some flaws as well, farming early game is terrible. since it is just inefficient. you have to apply a lot of fertilizer, water and straw just to make a profit, you can't automate farming either so you have to constantly be on watch to water.

bad:

!!they added the feature to group items and move them in bulk in the 1.0 update!!

moving housing items is a real chore, there is no area select so you have to move each individual item one by one (including farming plots). i would just recommend using your character instead at some points. moving your house with 2+ stories is also annoying as whenever you move it, you have to move each individual story top to bottom and if you had items in the house after reapplying those stories, some might get removed since staircases don't remember their last known location but instead have a predetermined location every time you add a new floor.",2332

2023-10-26,"[h1] basically mtap but better and more [/h1]
[h2] tl;dr [/h2]
basically, if you've played and enjoyed my time at portia, you'll enjoy this as it's more of the same but higher quality, there's more content, some of the kinks have been worked out and generally this is what i would classify as a good sequel.

if you haven't played mtap: this is essentially a ""cozy"" farm life sim game with all the genre staples (npc relationships, expanding operations, planning your day and your season in order to maximize €$, home customization, yada yada bing bong), except replace ""farm"" with ""mechanic"".
you take on requests for materials and finished products which progress in complexity as you upgrade and expand your workshop with new machines, better equipment, et cetera.

the game offers some customization of your experience, including a slider that speeds up or slows down the passage of in-game time. if you're into this genre of games, you will like this game. it's well put together, i personally haven't encountered any breaking bugs, it performs well, it looks nice and there's a lot to do.
[hr][/hr]

[h2]in detail[/h2]
[h3]the good[/h3]
[b]graphical quality[/b]
the game is quite a step up from portia, and comparing it to other offerings within the genre that adopt 3d visuals, i think only harvestella has it beat, in terms of technical quality (shaders, lighting, texture work et cetera) and details such as tufts of grass bobbing in the wind, sand particles and dust clouds blowing over arid terrain, npcs and mobs reacting to things happening around them.

[b]performance[/b]
i'm playing this on deck. when i first tried this on deck when i bought it roughly a year ago, i was forced to put the settings to a low preset, and my deck struggled to maintain 30fps. in the current version, in the year of our lord 2023, i have every graphical setting maxed out and the game is running between 30 and 60 fps on average. easily hitting 60fps in interiors.
all in all, with how the game looks, i think the performance is pretty impressive.

[b]sheer volume of content[/b]
i'm roughly 20 hours in to a new save on this version, and it feels as though i have yet to finish the first chapter in the story - i'm still witnessing new character introductions, npcs treat me as the ""new builder"". at the same time, literally every day since starting the game (i'm roughly at the end of the first in-game month) i've started the day with a new unique situation unfolding that day, ranging between character plot and main story beats, sometimes unlocking new features, sometimes unlocking new areas, sometimes just offering up new insights in characters or the world.
there also appears to be quite a breath of content. i haven't dipped my to into every system yet - i honestly don't even know roughly how much of the systems on offer i've engaged with. however, on top of the workshop, it appears you also gain access to more traditional elements such as farming plots and animal keeping. then there's a whole slew of activities available on certain days of the week, usually small in scope but quite numerous, such as making weekly deliveries of clay to the pottery artisan or helping with cleaning up the communal water supply. these may be simple activities, but they do help build a sense of community and add authenticity to the setting.
there's a lot more, but i can't be arsed getting in to it. just know that the main meat of the game (running the workshop) has quite a bit of depth, and at the same time there's breadth of content in the periphery.

[b]writing[/b]
people who played mtap know this already - the writers at pathea seem to have quite a bit of fun adding character to, well, the characters. this games' script has a lot of moving parts: when certain events trigger is directly influenced by your actions as a player, so the order in which events happen can't be guaranteed. despite this, the tone of the script is quite consistent. even if when you jump from a serious scene where the titular town is under assault to one where a writer is receiving eloquently phrased harsh critiques from a kid (""i'm in your tawget demogwaphic"" cracked me up) and you can see his heart break a little. this is all backed up by surprisingly good voice acting. the voice cast is varied, mostly fits the characters being depicted and the direction is excellent. this is a step up from portia.
i think they spent more time proofreading the game script as well, as even the little stuff like item and skill descriptions have been immaculate so far.

[b]game flow[/b]
this is hard to pin down exactly, but the game flows really well once you get into the rhythm of it. anyone who's played a game in this genre will know what i mean by that; you get into a routine, find out what works and what doesn't, and then you start scaling up and becoming a giant capitalist with a zillion weird lil machines churning out products, earning you a tidy profit. in sandrock, somehow, even early game resources kept feeling worthwhile to amass, and i ended up doing my best to figure out what to spend the day in in order to keep the machines running with stuff which would allow me to most efficiently complete next days' comissions.


[h3]the subjective[/h3]
[b]character art[/b]
love it or hate it, portia character designs were distinct. in sandrock, the style is a bit less pronounced. personally, i like it better this way, as i found the portia characters veered between distinct and grotesque.

[b]focus/direction[/b]
this game definitely requires you to explore and experiment a bit. a lot of information is available in-game, especially once you've discovered something e.g. a material will have details on how to procure it once obtained.

[h3]the bad[/h3]
[b]a sense of confusion and/or being overwhelmed[/b]
this game has the exact same issue as portia: it's front-loaded, and it doesn't always succeed in explaining all of its' mechanics due to the sheer amount of stuff there is to see and do. some things go completely unexplained and just sit there in the ui, staring at you accusatorily, daring you to interact with them and finding out what will happen. 
there's a lot of systems which is all fine and dandy, but you're also not incentivized to take your time figuring them all out. this makes especially the first few days of the game play out in a hectic fashion. i had to re-learn a bunch since it's been a hot minute since playing mtap, and starting this fresh would probably be worse. it's a shame, because i can imagine people being scared off by this. heck, i put down portia and almost never came back to it when i first played it, due to this exact issue.

[b]simultaneously polished and full of skung[/b]
this game contains nintendo levels of detail and polish in some areas, and gets extremely skungy in others, and these disparate levels of polish overlap at times. to illustrate: i'm watching a nicely choreographed cutscene complete with great lighting and what appears to be a blend of mo-cap and manually done character animations, lending it legitimacy while keeping consistent with the general art direction of the game. the cutscene ends. my character automatically starts pathing towards an arbitrary position, gets snagged on a fence, runs in place for a moment, phases out of existence, reappears a few meters away, and two npcs pop in next to them. all the while little shrubs are waving in the wind as a tumbleweed rolls by in the beautifully rendered sand drifts.
to be honest, this could be seen as a positive as well, considering the fact that all of portia nested comfortably in the janky skungzone, so it's a triump pathea have managed to elevate their work to this level. however, the disparity means that the skungness stands out more admidst the nintendonean polish levels, whereas in portia the entire vibe was skung so it just fit.",2257
2023-10-24,"23 oct 23:
the story has an intriguing story and it is quite rewarding to see the impact you make on sandrock. without any spoilers, i'm very much looking forward to the next chapter in the ""my time"" world. i think most of the characters feel unique (to the other townsfolk, at least). the romance storylines i followed were sweet, but there are some characters that you will not interact with or be able to romance until very late game, which is kind of frustrating.

but to be honest, the game has a laundry list of basic quality audio, graphics, and  issues, even as the release date is right around the corner. also, if you grind through the storylines, some progression issues and quest overlapping are going to happen (at least during the pre-release phases).

much like its moniker, sandrock needs further polishing before it becomes ""the jewel of the eufala"".",2332
2023-10-23,"my time at sandrock improves a lot on what my time at portia already got right. i played both, and even in early access, sandrock got me playing nonstop for a week. the character and object models, the combat, the characters, the story, the dungeon dwelling aspect. i just really love this game! the water and tree cutting mechanics are really innovative and fun and add a good kind of difficulty in the game. you can really tell the love the devs put in this game. i def recommend it.

2023-10-21,"having finished the game i can say this game was much, much bigger than my time at portia to begin with.

now for the rest of the game, i've loved it, i think i would have loved it even more if i hadn't played it piecemeal from the early access so everyone gets it better now waiting for the full release.

the story is fun and delightful with nice complete arcs.

i find myself loving everything around, the characters are delightful and varied with their personalities. 

the quests all seem to make sense and the side quests are nice, the main quests mostly aren't timed so you set your pace, mostly... there are forced gaps/delays, so if you are like me that means breakneck speed. core gameplay loop is solid.

though my favorite self-indulgence in this game is the fact that everything you make that is bigger than hand sized exists in the world. you can go out and see it all, from elevators, to shrubs, to buildings and more.  the world really does change with your actions and it shows there in the world, 

there are still some bugs and little minor things but as long as you don't care too much you will enjoy the game.",3009
2023-10-21,"if you played and liked my time at portia, go ahead and grab this. it's a bigger and better game in basically every way.

if you haven't played it, well, this is a farming game where you don't farm much. specially because now you are in the middle of the desert, and you can't just fill your watering can from a well. instead, most of what you do is building; do some ruin diving, collect resources, smelt ore, and bang out the things sandrockers commission you to make. sleep and repeat.

in the meantime, you will have the chance to get to know these colorful characters better and learn a fair bit about the post-apocalyptic world they live in. with a much longer duration, this game manages to flesh out much of the worldbuilding the first title only alluded to.

production values are not in the aaa ballpark. the ea version i played had some pretty bad pop-in issues, and while most of the dialogue is voiced, some side content isn't. still, this is a game with heart, and if you are looking for something cozy to put a solid hundred hours in, you can certainly do a lot worse.",3009

2023-10-16,"this game is amazing, easily in my top 5 right now. i started playing a few weeks ago (never played my time at portia so i was a little unsure on what to expect) but my time at sandrock has surprised me every single time i played it. from the characters, to the dialogs, to the story! hells, i wasn't expecting such a great story from a farming/life simulator game! i was hooked since the very begining and after 130h+ i still have to finish act 3.
i can't wait till november 2 to finally play the ""complete"" version of the game, but so far it's been an amazing journey and i will definitely keep playing the game for a long time, romancing different characters, replaying the story, enjoying everything this amazing world has to offer. thank you to everyone that has made this game possible, i love it.",2742

2023-10-23,"[h3]wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle[/h3]

the #1 issue with this game is bloat. according to the devs, the story is 3.29 times longer than my time at portia – already a pretty long game, mind you. i know “more game” is supposed to be good, but sandrock overstays its welcome and makes you wonder when it finally ends. imagine watching a movie, and after an epic showdown with the main villain, when you’re ready for the credits to roll - another movie begins instead. it means you need many hours of your life to complete the story in one sitting and not lose track of it. there are more than twice side quests than portia, too - and most of them are on a timer. i ended up so overwhelmed by quests that i began refusing them at some point, which in turn led to a frustrating feeling of missing out on content. there is more of everything else as well. there are hundreds of items - scrap alone comes in like 15 varieties - making inventory management an ever-present annoying part of the gameplay. 

if a developer from pathea is reading this - i would like you to grab a sheet of paper, write “less is more” on it, then hang it somewhere in the office where everyone can see it every day. i have no need for 20 romantic interests in the game, if the majority of them will lack character, quests, unique items, voice acting... give me just 3 but make them really fleshed out and rich with content. case in point: nia - she got so much backstory, relevance to the plot, unique events and ties to the main character that she makes every other romance look like an unnecessary waste of development resources.

[h3]cardboard protagonist[/h3]

sandrock is a heavily narrative-driven game. for 100-150 hours you will be listening to dialogue with multiple people, constantly referencing your character. for some reason, even though your character is not a “blank slate” and has a backstory, parents, childhood friend etc. you are free to name him/her whatever you want. this creates a huge problem for voice actors. you see, expecting them to voice dozens of custom names like codsworth or vasco would be unrealistic, so they only had two options - either skip the player character’s name entirely, or to use generic “the builder”. as a result, dialogue constantly loses meaning and feels jarring. for example, “me, harris and you will go to the cave” turns into “me and you will go to the cave”; “s.s. harris” (ship name) turns into “s.s.” (???), and even though you can be a best friend to people and marry them, they will still refer to you as “the builder” (even if there are other builders present in the same scene). 

what exacerbates this issue is the silent protagonist. which on its own perhaps wouldn’t be that bad - if mi-an didn’t exist. mi-an is also a builder, and so in most scenes she effectively speaks for both of you and ends up praised for things you did. all leading to a feeling of the player character being a sidekick to mi-an. while i realize voicing the whole 250.000 words main story is unrealistic, this just leads back to my point - why did they write a huge story like that?

[h3]howdy, pardner![/h3]

sandrock feels awfully derivative - it just grabs about every single gameplay element and design decision from portia and carefully copy/pastes them into a new game. the only meaningful difference here is the new desert setting, and frankly - it’s terrible and doesn’t work for a game like this. you will struggle to tell the seasons apart - it’s always just sand, with the (very) subtle coat of white in winter and green in spring. outside of an occasional sandstorm the weather is also static for the most part – you will not see any snow and i only witnessed rain 1 (one!) time after 100+ hours into the game. of course, there are setting-based complications: like you need water (rare and expensive) to cool your machines; sand accumulates on them over time so you need to clean it; you are not allowed to chop trees near the city etc. however, ultimately all of it feels like busywork, aimed at making your early game more painful and tedious than it needs to be.

narratively, it’s just a mix of every wild west cliché. your will hear “howdy!” from about every character, even the newcomers. there are sheriffs, bandits, cowb... i mean, yakboys. which i could probably live with, but the huge appeal of a my time game is to be able to improve your community and see a meaningful impact of your actions over time. i still remember building a fast travel system in portia and how much of an achievement it felt. here the main theme is greenification of the desert however, which essentially makes you feel like a sidekick to botanist characters and a glorified gardener, as the builder stuff takes a backstage to planting trees. furthermore, the first half of the exceedingly long story just has you doing barely meaningful stuff, with the common theme being “bandits broke our bench/water tower/farm/statue - please repair it!”. yes, there are guns now - but they feel like a gimmick, requiring entering an “aiming” mode, and are so ammo-hungry that using them is just not sustainable, unless you enjoy grinding mines to make more bullets. you do get the ability to join civil corps as a deputy this time round, but ultimately this only serves to further distract you into becoming a “jack of all trades”.

[h3]rpg and progression[/h3]

sandrock tries to be more of an rpg, with everything from your chair to your horse coming in multiple tiers of quality. you can also “refine” an item to increase its level and quality by throwing rare gems you first have to grind at it. at first i thought this to be a very cool system, as i imagined it would be possible to upgrade any piece of clothing indefinitely and make it competitive in the late game - but you’re only able to upgrade anything up to 10 levels above its “required level”, making the system pointless. furthermore, this system only made matters worse as for the first half of the game i had to actively avoid the “blue” quality commissions - because i simply did not have the required gems at the time to make such quality items.

also, while there are levels and skill points – you will easily unlock everything provided you play long enough, so there are no builds or anything like that. the perks are subtle buffs rather than something that has great impact over the gameplay. as such, the main form of progression comes in the form of gear - and is fully tied to the main story, which unlocks more areas and resources. while you unlock bronze and iron relatively early on and at a steady pace, it is unfortunately followed by a very long and stale midgame where you don’t unlock anything until late game, where you get chromium and aluminum almost back to back.

[h3]writing[/h3]

sandrock is filled to the brim with memes and popular culture references, and every quest title is an attempt at a witty pun. it all looks quaint and fun at first, but quickly grows exhausting, especially as the writers make npc go more and more out of character just to throw in another “mic drop!”. the writing feels too concerned with the “current day” agenda for a game that’s supposed to take place in a post apocalyptic setting. for example, a woman i offered my help said she does not accept “free help” from strangers, and almost reported me for sexual harassment. and after that a homosexual man made advances on my male character without my consent, or ever speaking to that particular character to begin with. some characters are so obnoxious i found it really hard to co-exist with them in the same game.

[h3]tl;dr upgrade? more like side-grade![/h3]

my time at sandrock was almost 200 hours full of adventure and emotions. just like portia, this game has quite a few enjoyable things. pretty graphics, some quality of life additions, even the optimization is finally half-decent! unfortunately, all the diamonds are buried deeply under the sand of a game that is too ambitious for its own good.

2023-10-20,"this game is so much fun, i think i enjoyed all the character's personalities and the many voice actors the game had. i read a review before that said there is always a reason to do just one more day. this is so true. i'm about 120 hours game play in. i like to spend a lot of time doing side quests, gathering, and building. i want to be a rich builder. i just now got through a major plot in the story. i'm sure there is still hours of game play left. i played portia before when it first came out on switch. i struggled with it for some reason. building was hard for me and... i gave up. now that i played this one on pc, i think i'm actually ready to go back and give portia a try again. the story and all the mentions of portia makes me want to play it because i read that the timelines of the game are actually parallel? so while we are working hard to grow sandrock, there is a ""star builder"" in portia working hard to grow portia. now i must know the story! 
what i disliked is a pretty small list. the mounts can be a little glitch sometimes when they are following you. other times for some reason i can't seem to interact with an object, i have to run around and click on other things then try to come back to it. the most annoying one is sometimes if i have to pause and go out of game to do something on my desktop. when i come back, the mouse is missing and i can't click on stuff in my inventory. i normally have to save and restart for it to fix. pretty minor dislikes, none of them break the game. oh and for some reason when i pose with my camel a certain pose, the bottom of his mouth disappears! its creepy what the inside of his mouth looks like with no bottom of his face.",2515

2023-10-20,"one of my favourite games, ever.
the story is engaging (200 hrs and i'm still not finished), the characters are interesting and lovable, the scenery is gorgeous, the pets are so. freaking. cute. and the controls are never clunky. i despise grinding in farming/crafting sims and that was not a problem here.
plenty of clothing and customisation options (could use a few more hairstyles), diverse cast and plenty to do at all times.
this game is visually stunning, has tons of character and the dialogue is super funny, i was not expecting to laugh so much. i was very invested in the main story, and everytime i felt smug about accurately predicting something, another twist would knock me off my pedestal. 
weeks before full release, my only qualms with this game are sandfishing (annoying but easily ignored) and building/decorating your house. there are too many size and placement restrictions for my taste. the other sets look great with similar assets that we have access to, so i'm hopeful for improvement.

if you're like me and couldn't get into portia, sandrock exceeds its predecessor in every way and is worth another try.
all in all, a marvellous achievement. bravo, pathea.",2515
2023-10-20,"first steam review... i love this game and i loved my time at portia as well. this is a great sequel that feels endless. i love the customization they added to this game and if you're having hesitations, i say go for it. i waited months until i got it on sale and thought i'd leave it alone until full release... that obviously didn't happen hahha. i got curious opened up the game and have been enjoying it immensely despite the initial hesitation i had from other reviews.  all in all this game is loads of fun and  makes a nice sequel to its predecessor with added bonus of even more content and more interesting npc's.",2515

2023-10-17,"tldr - this game is a gem with lots to do to keep you busy and runs well with minimal bugs.

   long main story, tons of sides, loveable characters, and scratches that builder itch you may have.  most of the lines are voice acted.  can get repetitive later levels and the story, whilst good, goes off the rails.  overall totally worth the price per content as in my first play though took 140 hours and i still didn't do everything i wanted... on play through 2 this time for a better set up to /romance all the characters =p.  oh, and you can save almost anytime minus like a super important event, but can usually save before or after, you don't have to wait for the sleep cycle.

  there are minor bugs, usually fixed with a reload.  some resources are a little too limited imo that commissions will flood your board.  resources start getting cluttered late game.  some features that were in portia are not here.  the game is set up for dlcs, which is fine.  i'm curious to see the generation features.  one of my npc couples had a baby later in the game, was a total mind melt, though this feature for the main character won't be released till launch.
 
  i can't really comment on the multiplayer aspect, only from what i've read from other users.  but, i'm judging this game as a standalone single player experience.  and at it's core, is a great game.  if there was some way to make multiplayer have different homesteads, i think that would make it ideal, but i think it's just sharing one property.

2023-10-13,"loads of content, enjoyable and rewarding game loop",2729
2023-10-20,"wanted to write this before the official release of the game. 

i have 221 hours played on this game, spread over about three saves. if that doesn't speak about how much stuff there is to do, even in early access, then i don't know what would. 

obviously, the start was a bit rough, but overall the game was still pretty good. it continued improving as pathea kept listening to player feedback and making good decisions, eventually leaving me to believe it's one of, if not the, best game of its kind. beating even, i know i'll get questioned for this but whatever, stardew. it easily crushes portia, too. i loved portia, but sandrock improved on soooo much. in portia, it feels like you were just shoved into having to make a bunch of commissions, but in sandrock you get introduced to everything one at a time, which makes it easy to pick up. it also made it so it's much easier (and quicker) to start a relationship with a person, but i'll get into that later.

the main thing of the story is uncovering the truth about what's been going on in sandrock. the geeglers, the insidious, but dashingly handsome bandit logan, and even... an evil empire?! you'll play throughout all these events and make the town a thriving success like it used to be. you'll meet a ton of loveable, or annoying (yan), characters and get to know them and their story as you progress through the game.

another improvement is the combat. combat felt slow and sluggish in portia, and most farming/sim/crafting/rpg games do it poorly, but sandrock makes combat interesting and a little more interactive. it may not be overwhelmingly complex, but it's also not move and click. there are a few different melee weapons, each with their own bonus stat and fighting style, and then three, i think, ranged weapons: a pistol, rifle, shotgun. as i said, combat isn't super easy or simple, but it also isn't too hard. i think it's a definite improvement from portia and games like coral island or stardew that just have you face an enemy and spam click.

now i know i've compared this game to stardew twice already, and i will admit, it's not fair. both are great games with two massively different playstles. but i am judging both as a game about farming and/or crafting and social sims, like they both are, to some degree, but sandrock is a lot more story-oriented and emphasizes on combat, crafting, and exploration. so i'll stop comparing the two!

now on to make this simple:

character creation + development - 7/10. i want to give this a higher rating, but the character customization is lacking, especially for the males with no good facial hair options. maybe that'll change in the official release? idunno. anyway, i give it a 7 because you can get your character to a good looking person, and then the development of that character, including the adventures they go through and how you choose to treat people, matters too. i think it's a beautiful example of the fact that, sometimes, one person can make all the difference.

combat - 8/10. a good rating, i enjoyed the combat greatly. obviously it's no dark souls or anything like that, but it's a huge improvement from portia. and being able to choose a weapon you specialize in, or just specializing into all of them and switching between them, is so fluid and nice; especially when you get the shotgun. good lord is that fun.

exploration - 6/10. this would also be higher, but sadly a lot of the exploration is gated behind time and requirements. but when you do unlock a new zone, there isn't much to explore. yeah you get new materials to craft new and better equipment, but it does feel like you're stuck in a desert and can't go anywhere. 

socializing/romance - 9/10 beautiful! i loved getting to know all the characters in sandrock. i even got to bff with almost every available npc and got to know their story, though some of it came from game progression. but the romance is so much easier and better than portia. you can give gifts, go on ""play dates"" and eventually go on real dates and then get married! i haven't really dabbled in the marriage part because nia isn't available for romance yet as of writing this. *shakes fist* but i do know there are even children to be had! exciting! you won't get bored of any of these lovely sandrockers. 

graphics - 10/10 for the type of the game it is, the graphics are gorgeous. i love farming/dating sims, but usually have to settle for less-than appealing graphics, like potion permit, sun haven, etc. but with sandrock, you don't have to settle! they definitely made better looking people and areas than in portia. i hated how the heads were in portia, but in sandrock, it's all good, baby!

overall; the game is just.. awesome. i give it a solid 8/10, i have a few gripes and problems with it, as with every game to be fair, but maybe that'll change in the official release. is it worth it full price? heck yes! buy it. you will not be disappointed. it has a lot of replay-ability and tons of content. and here's hoping we'll get more content as time goes on! but yeah, that's my review of sandrock. i never write reviews for games unless they leave a great impression on me, i think the only other review i've ever made is on stardew. but yeah, anyway, sorry to digress. i definitely recommend the game, especially if it's on sale? heck of a deal. 

get it. play it.

and remember! 

conserve water!",2515
2023-10-16,"i literally have been playing nonstop for like a month now and as much as i'm binge-playing it, i want it to last and never end. it's that good ;-;. great sequel to my time at portia, although you don't really need to have played that one to understand this one as they each hold on by ithemselves (but you should play mtap too!). big fan of the npcs and all their unique personalities. big fan of how cozy and wholesome it is despite its' post-apocalypse(?) theme. big fan of pathea games from now on. :)",2742
2023-10-15,"i loved my time in portia, so when another title in the ""my time in"" universe got announced i was excited, thrilled and i was right about it. the developer likes to brag about how much more stuff there is in sandrock than it was in portia and you can feel that. the quests are even better, the story is at least as interesting as in portia, the characters as lovely as it gets while be unique in town. sandrock is definitely not a copy&paste, even though you feel like becoming a part of a family, just like back in portia. you should give it a try.",3497

minor bugs so far aside, it's a super fun game that builds on the things in my time at portia, while also changing things up enough to feel distinct as a game. i'm really enjoying my time so far, and i look forward to seeing how the rest of the game goes!",3497
2023-10-15,"i prefer to play simulation games on handheld platforms, so i'm pretty sad to see there's no real functionality on the steam deck despite there being a switch release in the lineup. on deck, the main menu just freezes once you've made your first selection and you can't back out or move forward, though the store lists it as ""playable"". i know the game is still in early access despite the full release version popping up when i load in, so hopefully this will change, because i really loved what little i played through on my pc last year.",3497

2023-10-13,"what a massive improvement from my time in portia, which was already an incredible game! 
many many improvements overall. most notably the graphics, improved character models, visuals & aesthetics of the game! 

the biggest and greatest change for me. is the storage. yes correct, storage and inventory management is a thing of the past with this new system! you can now auto-store all stacks of items across all your stashes at once! thus allowing you to keep unique items on you, but stack up all your inventory junk instantaneously. 
not only that. but your stashes act as a sort of backpack now. anything in your stashes count as being on your person for the sake of crafting, handing in commissions etc.. 
this is a game changer as the most tedious park of portia that burnt me out and prevented me from completing it. was the constant inventory management. in sandrock you can now auto-store all stacks then continue the focus on having fun! 

and boy is it fun! there is 2-4x the content than in portia, and with inventory management to the wayside. you can really dive in and just get lost in the experience!

i can't really find any faults with the game. for the price you are paying this is def a 10/10 product imo.",2729
2023-10-13,"this game is still in early access so my feedback is based on this. 
i cannot recommend this game enough! i've been playing early access since about january this year and it's been incredible to see the game grow, as well as seeing how much the devs care about player feedback and incorporates it into the game. i've played through it a couple of times now and am still eager for the full release, as it's got solid replayability. 

pros:
+ story and writing are well done, fleshed out and engaging (and very funny!). it's also nice to have a post-apocalyptic game with a more positive spin on it, focused on rebuilding the town/nature.
+ engaging with npcs is integrated into the storylines so it feels more organic (rather than having to go out of your way too much to build friendships)
+ fixed lots of qol issues that were present in portia so it's far smoother and quicker to build
+ if you've got cozy game fatigue where it's all farming and fishing, this is a wonderful reprieve from that. while there is farming and fishing involved, it's mainly optional so i tend to avoid it altogether. 
+ so! much! to ! do!

cons
- there are still some bugs, so for those who haven't played i recommend waiting until full release to allow time for polish",2729
2023-10-13,"i have 115 hours playing time in this game and was really starting to enjoy the game (the start of the game is a bit of a grind). i have reached a point where i cannot progress, the game is over for me due to a freezing issue with one of the quest. i have to stop the game via task manager. i was hesitant in buying early access but the full release date had been announced for this past sept. after buying the dev.  extended the date to nov. i will keep an eye out for further updates (hot fixes released today didn't fix my issue) in hope that this game becomes playable again. i do not want to start over.",2729
2023-10-10,"as someone who was pretty neutral regarding my time at portia, this game just is a big step up in every regard.
the visuals are better, the style more appealing. the jank has been reduced (albeit not completely eliminated) and everything is just more polished. better sounds, music, voice acting. huge quality of life improvements in terms of building and inventory management.

overall, it's my time at portia +1, improved in every regard. it's a long game with a huge storyline and a memorable cast of townspeople. get this game if you enjoy the genre of farm/build/lifesims!",2733
2023-10-10,"i love this game! i really enjoyed the first game, my time at portia, and i'm impressed by the improvements both to quality of life and to characterization that sandrock brings. i love that this game isn't just a copy-and-paste of portia on a desert aesthetic; with aspects like needing to keep water in mind, the different resources available (and the ones protected within town), and sandstorms, sandrock feels both like its own game and like a worthy sequel. you don't have to have played portia to enjoy this game, either, as it stands alone very well.

i appreciate that the team working on this game has taken feedback into account. sometimes the audio balancing was a bit off, and certain things were too loud (sorry for avoiding you for so long, sandy!), but after the most recent update those seem to have been pretty much fixed.

one of my favorite things to do while i'm relaxing is to play this game while showing it to my friend. we love the pacing of this game, always having enough to do but not feeling overwhelmed. i appreciate being able to adjust the speed of the passage of time, so we can get all the things done that we want to in a day.

the game is also quite beautiful. i like to bring the in-game camera to various scenes to take pictures and hang them up in my character's house. anyways, this long and rambling review can be summed up by: thank you for making this game! it's by far one of my favorites.",2733
2023-10-13,"hi there, i love this game. i also played my time at portia, and its really good to have that knowledge and have it extended into this game. it really helps. not necessary, but you do get a sense of being really part of having the feeling of understanding the rich storyline and its people, in the game. yes of course i would recommend this game. on both games i was an early access player, and we ea players went through the gamut of getting the bugs, and the changes until the game was brilliant in all its glory. i have read a lot of the posts and feedback of those submitting their ideas and gripes. its real life stuff and its because we have partaken in it, is because we feel a real part in its making. - 'the 'my time at'series! lol.  i was thinking the other day that it would be great to just whistle the horse and have it be there, because i do tend to get myself in fixes sometimes and really, would just love my horse to come and get me- especially when i've been at the mines all night and the bus stops have closed for the night. i usually just pass out on the road! lol. good thing i wake up in the morning and find myself with enormous black eyes.  i didn't like the panda eyes when they introduced it, for you do walk around looking like a zombie, and then you have to go to the general store and buy the cream to cover the black. this game is so busy and richly full. there is so much you can enjoy doing in it.  i love the sandrunning game where you get into a sand sled and you go down this enormous sand hill and avoid/ try to avoid huge monoliths  in the way and you steer it and gain special point awards. it is really fun.  i did have a boyfriend in this game but he kept running away from me, being too immature i guess, so i scrapped that and didn't want to get complex with anyone. i love just working hard, being the best at what i do and making loads of money with a fantastic house! lol. besides, there are beautiful animals that i own now and they keep me company! there is sooo much fun in this game. i love it. it is nearing its full completion in the making - only a month or so away.  if the guys at my time at series make more, i know i will be sure to be a follower and a life long fan. thanks pathea. :-)",2729

although i do recommend going in patiently, its a game where you work to unlock and evolve, there is so much to do. you can take commission requests to build, go on dates with different activities and personal touch, even spar with npcs as friends or play cards. so much to do but i wont spoil that.

2023-10-11,"if you liked my time at portia, then you'll like this game too, or perhaps even better.
after 100 hours into sandrock in 9 days, it's probably time for me to take it slow from now on. i've finished most of the main story stuff at this point but i think there's still a new area to unlock. it's been a long wait for sure. i bought the game the first day it was available on steam and waited till the main story questline was finished to finally play it. i'd say that the wait was worth it. overall, sandrock is better than portia in almost every aspect. i especially enjoyed the story and the characters. however, the game still feels a bit glitchy. there were a few crashes, the interact option sometimes won't appear immediately, my horse can fly, etc. i'll definitely have another playthrough once the definitive version is out (likely a year or so later i guess). 

here's a few things that i enjoyed the most:

1. the world

the view of sandrock is quite breathtaking and i often find it enjoyable just walking amongst the wilderness while gazing at the mountains. the biome and monster design is certainly a whole level better than portia (at least they make sense now). it's also quite rewarding to find little bits of lore here and there. 

2. story and characters

there's a lot more to the story of sandrock than portia, but in order to not spoil anything i'll just say that i liked it a lot. kudos to the writers. it also fleshes out the world a lot more that i'm now looking forward to the third game (please let there be a third game). i like the villains a lot, too. i especially like relatable villains. most of the romanceable characters are interesting and unique. i really enjoyed learning more and more about them and seeing some of them grow as a person. i might be biased, but i feel like the guys have more diverse personalities than the girls? like, i feel like all of the girls are the friendly and approachable type, but some of the guys need a lot more time to warm up to you. i kinda want to see a girl character being a jerk for a change. also, i suspect that unsuur is the dev's favorite considering how many quests he gets lol. 

despite how much i enjoyed the game, here's a few things that i didn't enjoy:

1. pacing (somewhere around mid-game to be more exact)
there's too much waiting mid-game that the game became kinda boring. since i played portia before, i was fairly familiar with the mechanics from the get go so i almost never wasted time on completing mandatory commissions. yet almost every main story quest requires you to wait for at least a day for the story to progress after you finished the job. maybe that's not so bad in itself, but nothing else was going on meanwhile except the main quests. the lag between the second abandoned ruins and the third was ridiculously long, while the forth was unlocked far too quickly in comparison (i hadn't even gotten to the bottom of the third ruins when the next was unlocked). the extremely repetitive guild commissions made it even worse. day in and day out, i was just handing out the same three or four items to the same people. the only thing i needed to gather was ores during that period and digging dirt for ores isn't exactly my idea of fun.

2. rival (or the lack of it...)
higgins was one of my favorite characters in portia and i was pretty disappointed with mi-an. it felt like she was just arbitrarily included in some parts of the story and absent in the rest. her character was rather uninteresting as well to the point the i rarely bothered talk to her. i'd talk to the non-romanceable townsfolk after most main story events but not her, that's how uninterested i was. her character is just inherently 'good' that she never had any character development (or perhaps there is but i'm not friends with her so i didn't get to see her events). the rest of the guild was just a joke. i don't feel any sense of accomplishment being called 'the best'. (my workshop score is currently around 20,000 and the second place is around 3,000. i almost feel bad for them.)

3. play and date
i haven't dated anyone yet since a certain someone only becomes available very late into the game, so i've only been hanging out with characters as friends so far. i noticed that characters now have multiple possible responses to each dialogue option so it's more worthwhile to chat with them multiple times. however, the activities available aren't that much of an improvement compared to portia imo. there are a few different mini-games, and that's it. it's basically the same formula. i was hoping that they could've made the dates less awkward  but perhaps romantic dates are better? oh well, i guess i'll find out soon. i know that with so many dateable characters in game it would be quite difficult to make the socializing aspect of the game more engaging, but still, no improvement or whatsoever is kind of a let down.",2579
2023-10-09,"i like it overall but some things are annoying - the timeline of events is very quick. just getting a handle on how things worked and you get a talk about how your workshop is only #4 and that they expect more.  there's no real leeway to explore and build.

also, if you play, have a lot of ram. on a good graphics card and 16gig ram it lags to hell for a singleplayer game.  the load screen time are reminiscent of the sims 2.",3019
2023-10-09,"this game is very unique, there isnt many games like this, ive searched for so many romance games but somehow i always seem to come back to either my time at portia or sandrock. so far i really enjoy both of them and their stories are really amazing and i hope that there will be more sequels. as im not done playin  any time soon. atm i got 200+ hr play time. and i really love these games. so i will pray and hope there will be more. 

logan forever!!!!",3019
2023-11-14,"i really love this game.

i actually appreciate the mp coop is different and a bit less ""story"" than single player -- its nice to log in with the mates and just go to town (hah) making the numbers go up. i can see a lot more development on the coop side happening too.

combat is not the greatest but it is serviceable and vastly better than portia -- i appreciate how far this team has come.",12878
2023-11-14,"if you liked my time at portia, this game is exactly like it but just everything better and bigger.
i love portia and overall crafting games and this one is really one of the best the last years, the whole workshop feels great, the characters are great, the romance stuff feels great and making money feels good in it.

it hast like a 70-120 hour story depending on your speed that feels engaging and fun, thats one thing i miss from the most ""cozy"" games, but here you get a good story and world building.

graphics and performance is now great in full release, i play on my pc with everything on ultra and no problems 100+ fps and i play on the steamdeck with mid to high settings and getting my mostly stable 40 fps.

so if you wan't a cozy game where you can really put time into, character building, story, good gameplay this game is just for you. if you are already a portia fan there is 0 reason to not get it.

the only thing that really is worse is fishing... i love fishing in games like this but how fishing is in this game its kinda useless and not good. besides that its easily one of the best cozy crafting games the last years",12878
2023-11-14,"let's just get the important bit out of the way first: this is my 2023 game of the year. it was only a matter of when the game would come out of early access to claim its crown.

now then, on to why this game is, as of this writing, my 6th most-played title in terms of hours on my steam account.

it's basically everything from my time at portia, but improved upon and made better in every possible way. the world is bigger, the building mechanics refined to a visible-from-space shine, the action rpg story fleshed out in a way that makes it the primary driver of gameplay rather than purely a framing device.

indeed, this is less a cozy game with action-rpg elements and more a reimagining of the action rpg formula where cozy game mechanics are the primary driver of progression. the genres blend seamlessly in a way that they never have before—looking at you, horizon zero dawn and forbidden west and every ubisoft game, where the crafting is tedious and feels unnecessary.

but at the same time, this game also has a cozy soul. if you're played any harvest moon-like, the life sim elements are exactly what you want them to be and then some. building relationships with villagers, romance, family life, it's all there with plenty of choices and some remarkably well-written relationship and character backstory dialogue. there are just so many ways to get a villager's friendship up compared to, say, stardew valley's more traditional talk-and-gift approach, and with the anti-frustration feature of not having to talk to every villager every day just to keep their relationship level from backsliding.

speaking of anti-frustration features, there are plenty more in this game as well. none of the main story quests are timed; complete them at your leisure. get overleveled if the combat's not your strong suit. rush the main story quests to unlock more of the crafting recipes if that's your jam. speedrunners and challenge runners? go to town, the game's got plenty of measurable ways to keep score. 

almost none of the sidequests are timed. if you unlock them too fast, as happens when you're powering through the main quest and hitting every character's sidequest trigger faster than you can bang them out, well, take a step back and take your time. the devs listened to players during the early access stage of the process and took the most common frustration—players felt rushed—out of the game. you want to complete them as fast as possible, nothing's stopping you. but it all fits in with the overarching theme of well-camouflaged accessibility that never feels like it's being dumbed down.

as for the action and combat in the action rpg, well, the devs know they're not from software. this isn't going to challenge anyone with a firm grounding in action games. you can overpower just about anything in the game because the devs have consciously avoided the bethesda syndrome of level-scaling enemies. well, with one exception—going too far afield in a sandstorm is going to surprise you the first time you run into high-level versions of basic enemies—but even that is a smart stylistic choice that makes sandstorms feel appropriately dangerous and threatening for a game set against the backdrop of a desert environment with a strong ""green aesop"" running through the main story.

is the game perfect? well, no, no game is perfect, not even games that are otherwise among the greatest of all time (i say this as someone who loved everything about red dead redemption 2 except for the on-rails quest design, for example.)

for one thing, the fishing minigame is one of the weakest i've seen in this genre. it's simplistic and repetitive and offers almost no challenge and very little reason to even engage with it beyond a couple of cooking recipes. this is a shame, especially since portia's fishing minigame was quite fun and other games like stardew, animal crossing (and dinkum, which cribs heavily from it), and even red dead 2 have great outdoorsman-style fishing gameplay.

in addition, there are a couple of dungeons in the midgame that have a jarring tonal shift toward platformer gameplay. thankfully the devs refined it a bit after its initial introduction; jumps are more forgiving, there's plenty of ""coyote time"" with ledges, and there's the option to skip the trickiest segments if you fail them enough times, but for a game that otherwise has good dungeon design, there's a heavy ""why, devs?"" when playing the two dungeons in question.

but those are minor quibbles in a game that is otherwise the absolute apex of the cozy game genre with one heck of a story rpg to go with it.

absolutely, by miles, my 2023 game of the year. 10/10.",12878
2023-11-14,"try it you won't be disappointed, honestly the game is amazing i got it when it hit early access day one to support it, and patiently waited to play it till full release and it does not disappoint, this game is full of so much fun and talent, it's so refreshing to see smaller companies put all there heart and soul into a project, and it shows that you don't have to be some big named gaming conglomerate to make some truly and wonderful games, and honestly many of them have been tossing out many glitchy unfinished messes lately in the pursuit of money, so i say keep making amazing games your way and putting all your passion into them and i will be happy to continuously support you all, thank you!",12878
2023-11-14,"4/5 a very nice game with a lot of activities.

 more or less same basic activities as in stardew valley, farming (which is not that great here), gathering, building, a bit of rpg element. lots of quests, minigames, characters. overall game offers a ton of content and places to eplore in a chill enviroment.

the only problem is that main storyline develop really slow and most of the characters side stories are boring and you always try to skip them.",12878
2023-11-14,"my time at sandrock is the most polished and streamlined game in it's genre. when you go to use a machine, the first tab that opens shows you exactly the materials you need for commissions, assemblies and side tasks. not only that, it automatically selects the quantity you'll need to complete those things. you don't need to dismount before entering a building. all available missions are conveniently displayed to you on your map and in your mission log. all inventory chests can be accessed from any chest, effectively making one massive storage split apart into smaller compartments. there's a sort all button that will automatically take your inventory items and slot them into their respective chest, assuming a copy of that item is already stored. it's amazing. the game massively reduces the amount of time spent in game menus and gets you back into the parts of the game you want to spend more time in. it will be very difficult to go back to other village life sims after having been spoiled by sandrock.",12878

2023-11-14,"pretty full synopsis, no spoilers... except for the stupid actor part... which doesn't really spoil anything... it's the equivalent of saying, ""guy walks outside"" oh my gosh... he really did walk outside! spoilersss. i'm confident it wouldn't be the thing that kept me out of heaven by saying no spoilers...

if you liked my time at portia, you'll like this one. the controls are  basically the same with some minor differences that take getting used to. key difference i find amazing is that your storage is linked to your inventory when building, as well as most cases when giving gifts or completing quests. i found one instance where i couldn't give something in my storage and it's probably a bug. if a developer ever reads this, it was when one of the npc's was craving a ""copper plate"" i had to have it physically on me to give in that case... or maybe i'm dumb and haven't realized that all gifts must be in inventory to give and that's just a feature. in other words you don't need to spend hours organizing your storage... just throw it in and call it a day (except for clothes you want to keep... that's worth putting in it's own storage... everything else? who cares?)

relic hunting... is more exciting... maybe some won't like the change but i especially love it. instead of a giant cube room it's multiple floors of some building or something, and there are specific items you can get per floor. it makes it less of a ""find one of 50 relics which each have 2-7 pieces in this one giant room! didn't find them? well then do it all over again!"" now it's more like 5 relics per floor in a designed building that has multiple floors and start from whichever floor you want so long as you've gone deep enough to find the entrance to that floor. huge improvement in my book.

combat... i can't say about all the weapons... i started with the daggers tried, the others once, i love the daggers.... call me thorfin. 

combat is pretty similar to the old game, but just better. from armor breaking/staggering, to varying stats on the same item because of it's quality, which can range from low, to perfect, and then there's rare, which adds some cool features.... whether it's crafting, buying or finding. the items are all much more exciting in this game.

i was disappointed.... that everything feels mostly the same as the original game, but happy it's better. you're basically getting the same game but part two. 

the dialogue is mostly skipable, with the occasional choose your response, in which cases i regret not reading the dialogue... buuuut 95% of the time... totally skipable. unless i'm in a reading mood, i find it average, and occasionally good.

cut scenes.... are extremely lacking... it's like a low quality first time actor playing a major roll in a lead film, and the director says after each scene, ""cut.. that's a wrap... send it to production."" when they should've said, ""cut! that sucks! what are you doing! you're entering a scene where all the monsters are already gone, you've just barely shown up, and then you do a front roll into the room... from the middle of the room... you then aim your pistol, stand up, smile doing a finger spin with the pistol... catch it, blow the smoke off the tip of the pistol, when there is no smoke, because you haven't fired a single shot?... are you stupid? did you take acting lessons from stupid school? did you graduate top of your stupid class with stupid honors? because that was pretty stupid!""

now if they added a character to come in and say those exact words to that silly dude who did all those things... then it would've been hilarious, and we all would've understood... that's the stupid guy... but no, every cut scene is pretty much like that.

i love the game... plenty to make fun of, and critique, but that doesn't stop me from loving it. leave a comment/question if you have any specific inquiries.

dlc worth it?..... you aren't missing anything by not buying any of the dlc items... sure they'll give you a nice head start, but even though i had them i found myself not using any of them because i like starting a game with nothing and then building up to something awesome. if you're the same, save yourself a few bucks, otherwise if you just want some gear for some different looks, then maybe you'll like it.

character creation.... well at least you won't look like you have down syndrome in the game... unless that's what you're going for i'm sure you can pull it off!!! there is a major improvement on the quality of character in the creation tab... but i just want more!!! 

you really don't have a lot of options, and they don't leave you thinking, ""that character i made looks so bad a!!!"" it's more of a, ""well... i guess that's as good as it gets."" i liked how mine turned out, but it took 3 hours of messing around with every possibility, starting and deleting 3 games (the character never looks exactly the same in the game play)...before i finally got to ""my guy looks really kind of okay!""

(example... i put lipstic and changed the coloring on my guy to make him look like he had actual lips... not feminine lips... just dude lips... i get into the game... feminine af! deleted, and then did the same thing except made the lipstick lighter than what looked good... in the gameplay it looked pretty good. i mean.....i'm the equivalent of brad freaking pitt in this character creation screen! i look so good! kindof... joking aside i was happy with the final result. i can't say whether it's the same for making a girl since i didn't try.)

happy building ;).",12878

you only get 1 public storage to share across everyone. you'll have space issue very early in the game. the statues and relics will eat up your inventory space.
gear progression is okay but the end-game gear are ugly. wished there were more options. lvl 50 gear is better looking than lvl 55 gear. gear stats between 45 and 55 is not a big upgrade at all. the max lvl is 60 which means you can't max all of the skill tree.
building your house is not easy when you get to the 2nd floor upgrade. the furnitures does not snap well and the camera will snap to the 1st level when you want to place your furniture in a specific spot on the 2nd floor.

2023-11-13,"a fun, relaxing, quirky game that scratches all the right itches of this type of genre, while at the same time being unrefined, not at all challenging, and laughably cheesy. 

h o w e v e r - seriously yall, some of the bugs, mistakes, glitches and quirks in this game are just so bad and look like really easy fixes. 
- tree art has meshes that don't line up where it would appear ""chopped"" at the trunk. 
- the voice acting is either fantastic, or fantastically bad. if the actors have really thick native accents, don't tell them to sound country! it doesn't work! just have them speak in their native accent, it sounds fine and doesn't break immersion in a post calamity fantasy world. 
- do one more quality pass over your writing and dialogue, possibly with a native english speaker. there's some easy mistakes in the text/speech that can cause a lot of confusion. 
- fix the pop-in of assets! even if you have to force another second of load time for the player. i've gotten stuck in things that haven't appeared yet - especially on holidays. 
- don't automatically have the player start chopping a tree that they shouldn't be chopping! i don't want to be punished in game for doing something that i didn't mean to do in the first place. 
- allow calendar reminders for npc birthdays. 
- more sandstorms! they should damage shops and buildings, allowing for the builder to take on special commissions to repair them for temporary discounts. 
- warn players further in advance that quests are going to expire... 
- not everyone should get along. perhaps consider in the future that becoming friends with some people, means making enemies of others. make the relationship meters less linear. put more hints into the game to help the player know what gifts npc's love. i don't want to have to google this stuff!

2023-11-13,"it's worth the money. 6/10 rating for now

to sum it up: combat and exploration sucks, but the rest of the game is pretty good and makes up for some of it.

crafting and expanding your workshop is very fun as well as most of the campaign. relationships with the npcs is also good. the town is beautiful.

the bad part is combat, which lacks any kind of challenge and doesn't feel good. you level up your character by doing pretty much anything and this automatically increases your damage significantly. this meant that once i started the first combat oriented mission of the campaign, i was already 10 levels above the enemies and it felt very boring. aside that, i think the main issue is that combat feels very floaty and has no weight. the sound effects animations when hitting enemies are lackluster, making it feel very boring to hit enemies.

stages for exploration are very repetitive copy paste of enviroments and lack any true interesting parts or puzzles.

inventory management is also another small issue, since there's tons of different items, it gets hard to organize them all, specially playing on controller.

overall it's a pretty decent game, with much potential if they fix combat and level scaling.

2023-11-14,"if you love farming/building simulation games, you will most likely love this one. i have not even finished the game yet, but i wanted to post an honest and informative review while the game is at the height of attention. this is by far the #1 game in the genre for me. i normally do short and sweet reviews, but for a game like this i want to go over some of the important aspects of it that may make or break the players experience. so let me explain the good, the bad, and the ugly.

[b]the good[/b]:
-outstanding amount of content. you can see by my playtime that i have put in a significant amount of time. i have not even finished the main story yet, and i am not actually sure how close i am to the end. there is plenty of upgrades, levels, npc content, and building/farming to be done here

-you can have a farm with plants, chickens, buffalo, bunnies, and mounts

-there are about 20 or so romance-able npc's, all with their own character growth and story arcs along side the main story. some of them are very well done and interesting while others are not quite as fleshed out, but still enjoyable

-combat in the game is quick-paced hack-n-slash shoot-em-up style. there are ""dungeons"" to breeze through where you can get treasure, materials, and glory

-festivals are a lot of fun. you unlock more festivals as the game progresses and there are fun little mini games and unique events for each one of them.

-character creation is a bit similar to my time at portia and there are a lot of lore-friendly outfits and accessories you can use to personalize your builder. the hairstyles and coloring can be customized quite a bit to give you a unique look as well

-you can go on dates and hangout with the friends you meet in town, you can play mini games in an arcade and even mahjong at a later portion of the game.

-progression is slow but it feels great. every new house and machine upgrade you get feels like an achievement. you can upgrade your mounts, raise animals, have a huge farm, and it all feels earned. once you get more levels for your workshop and character and progress the main story you can automate collection of resources to help your progression quite a bit.

-the developers are awesome and are constantly replying to concerns and bug reports in the forums, as well as trying to improve the game.

[b]the bad[/b]:
-progression is slow. i know i stated this above, but people with not a lot of time on their hands may feel that they are not getting anywhere. a lot of this probably has a lot to do with how fast you decide to progress time. you can choose anywhere from 0.6x-3.0 time progression speed, and i believe that can have an impact on the pace of the game and how quickly it goes by. i like to take things slow and experience everything the game has to offer, so i have it set at 0.6.

-stamina and time can be hard to manage at first. you may feel a struggle early game trying to get the resources you need and finishing missions on time. this caveat goes away after getting some levels and experience under your belt. a lot of people feel a struggle at the beginning. taking the game slow is a good idea at the beginning until you get used to it.

-certain resources are very hard to get such as electronics, certain plants, trees, or animal resources. some of this stuff you need for progression but it is hard or impossible to automate in any way at the beginning. when you do commissions/missions for townsfolk, if you are not careful then you won't be able to complete them on time. this is why it is good to take it slow at the beginning and learn the ins-and-outs. this adds to early game struggle and gives a sense of not getting anywhere.

-some of the romance-able npc's don't really have much character development or story missions, decreasing their interesting aspect.

-the house building/decorating leaves much to be desired. it is difficult to place objects or know what objects to place in certain circumstances. the building ui is clunky and not user friendly. it can be struggle to get a look that you like. there are mismatched patterns or just plain ugly ones when making roofs or rooms. they honestly should have hired a color expert or interior decorator because some combinations of design can be atrocious. this part of the game is passable and you can get something that you are satisfied with, but it could take some workaround.

-workshop upgrades are incredibly expensive, to the point where you have to grind money for a long time to get room for all of the workshop add-ons, machines, and other goodies. it took me a good month of in game time to get an upgrade that would give me enough building space to extend my house because of how much money it was to get it. this part of the game feels a bit unbalanced, especially with how much money you will be spending elsewhere.

[b]the ugly[/b]
-this game is bethesda level buggy as of right now. i am not even remotely exaggerating. there are issues with npc's disappearing out of nowhere, floating mounts that you can't ride because they are stuck in the air, a visual bug that messes with some resource contracts, unclear missions markers or explanations etc.

-some missions have a timer on them. so you need to complete it in a certain number of days. there are several missions that you will fail for no reason at all with no in-game timer attached to them. these missions show no sign and give no hint of a fail-trigger, but if you don't do them then you will fail them at some point for what seems like no reason. i have had this happen a few times. this is usually with side missions. 

-you need to save a lot. there are some potentially game breaking bugs and missions you can screw up through no fault of your own, as stated above. it is a good idea to have several hard saves just in case something undesirable happens that messes up your progress with missions, npc's, or other aspects.

-the game does not run well sometimes. i get around ~60 fps pretty consistently, but certain areas, scenes, or events can cause huge framerate drops to as low as 15 fps, and i have had the game crash on me once. some people report even worse performance, but for me it is tolerable. i have a pretty decent gaming computer. i can run cyberpunk on max with a constant 60-70 fps, and this game performs slightly worse in certain cases. i will say that it seems they have ironed out some of this in the last week or so since my performance seems to have improved over the last couple days. in particular, when the train comes into town is one of the points where i get an fps drop to 15, but earlier today it did not drop when the train came in.

the game is by no means perfect, but it is my favorite game in the genre. if you liked portia or games like stardew valley, coral island, or any other popular sim games like this, then you will probably love this one. the developers are constantly looking at feedback and improving the game, so i am almost positive all of the negatives i pointed out will be fixed at some point in the future. they have already been actively releasing post-launch updates and they even intend to add more content eventually from what i have read. the developers and this game have my full confidence and support!

2023-11-13,"my time at sandrock has, so far, been a worthy sequel to my time at portia. if you're a fan of life-sims like harvest moon, rune factory or stardew valley, there's likely to be something here for you. 

panthea really stepped up their game on this one. actions feel so much more impactful and fluid than in portia. i have not completed the main storyline so far (77 hours in!) but i have really enjoyed how dynamic the characters and stories have been! 

i'd like to draw particular attention to the voice acting. while there are a few clunkers, no offense to them, the majority of the voice actors really hit it out of the park! similarly, the writing really rose to the occasion in this one. they'll occasionally reference memes or movies in their lines and i normally find that a little cringe but it happens sporadically enough that i find it endearing here. 

finally, if it means to anyone who has read this far, i seldomly review games here on steam. the ones i do are ones i really enjoyed! that means a whole lot right there.",14098

2023-11-13,"in the last week i've played this game for 80 hours. so i like it. just a a little.
my sister bought me this since she'd played the beta. normally i'm not the most excited to play life sims with farming in it because the market is oversaturated with samey, boring games that wish they could be like stardew valley.
instead, i got a game where i don't have to farm if i don't want to (except for some quests but. no daily watering anyway, so that's dope). the story itself has been super enjoyable, and fun. i didn't think it'd ramp up like it did, but serious, emotional moments would pop up out of nowhere, and it felt like such a treat. i can do basically anything, and at my own pace. there's very little the game stopped me from doing that wasn't story related. it's fun to have all the options in the world, and have none of them be a bad on.
sandrock has easily become one of my favorite games, and i hope there's more like it and portia in the future.",14098

2023-11-13,"i absolutely adore this game. i played the one before it, my time at portia and fell in love with that slice of life game, but this one has definitely took my number one spot.

the game is a blast, there's ruin diving, farming, workshop building, you can build your own house, can build a stable for your mounts, a barn for your farm animals, etc.

i haven't had a game give me such a breath of fresh air in a minute, and this one has been an absolute treat getting into. the character dialogue, relationships and backstories of all characters are so much improved than in my time at portia, it really feels like the devs not only built upon their previous title but still kept their heart on their sleeves while making this one. i'm currently 50 hours into a new game with no sign of finishing anywhere near soon, as i love to take everything slow and explore to my hearts content. now, there is some jank, it feels like the combat, while improved from my time at portia still plays fast and loose. sometimes it feels a little too spammy and other time it feels like you have a bullet sponge boss. also, my lock on is a bit fickle to say the least. but for any jank i mentioned there's a labor of love behind all of it.

i cannot wait for what the pathea game developers work on in the future with sandrock and other titles, they have definitely made me a fan of their work(s)!

2023-11-12,"i recommend it but it has a lot of flaws.
clunky cinematics, npc teleporting themselves out of scenery. after 50 hours playtime the game started lagging, the time was slowed and every animation was delayed and 5/6/7 seconds longer than usual. very put me out of it when it happen unfortunately. (restarting the game doesn't really work, skipping day or sometime going in and out of an interior can work)

the storyline is.. surprising for this type of game but cool overall. the 2/3rd of the game was pretty smooth with quest almost everyday guiding you and providing you goals to go forward. 
when you've done almost all side content, the game consist of sleeping to trigger main events. (after 70h+ for me.) so i'm starting to get tired of it even tho' i have still a few things to do.

the game can be really immersive if you're into this kind of game. socializing and housing is nice. 
still wasn't able to romance the character of my choice after 120h playtime. i don't know why but the person was constantly refusing the necklace even tho the npc is indicated as a possible bachelor. since the character is used in main story, maybe it'll change in a few in-game days. 
i played a few of portia but here i felt more guided (in a good way). main mission in portia was like : firstly build a bus stop, then go upgrade all your workshop and tools then go build the bridge. 
here it's more build this, then this but it need a new ressource that you can find here, and that allows you to start upgrading gears and workshop without it to be instantly needed to continue. making you feel like you're the one choosing to upgrade stuff to go faster, provide new things etc.

i backed the game and played a few during alphas and betas so i'm a little disappointed to feel like the game is unpolished at this state.

i don't know if i'll come back to this game but still, it kept me busy for 125hours so it made its part of entertaining me.",18838
2023-11-12,"in other farming games, i worry about progressing through the quests too fast. in this game, as in my time at portia before it, i know the quests will just keep coming and coming and coming. so much content, funny characters, and a serious upgrade to the inventory system that makes everything more convenient. 

what elevates this series above others for me is gradually being able to see the huge changes you make to the land and town. see that bridge/tower/mill etc.? i built that! i fixed that problem, and now i see it every time i ride past.",18838

combat has been greatly expanded and improved from the first game. the inclusion of boss fights with actual mechanics is something i never thought a cozy game like this would include. i was surprised when the mechanical cat boss showed up and i couldn't just spam the attack button on it. 
as for the visuals of the game, they are charming. the townsfolk feel much more alive than the first game and i am super glad they got rid of the main characters voice which was my biggest dislike from portia. this is just personal preference though, i've never been a fan of voiced pcs.

2023-11-09,"i had not played previous games by this developer, so for me there was a fairly hefty learning curve.  still, the story line, visuals, interaction, and game play are all interesting and very enjoyable.  it quickly became the game i want to play more than others.  
it isn't without bugs, but the developer is responsive and releasing patches frequently.  none of the glitches i've experienced have impacted my ability to play the game.  at one point the event audio got out-of-sync and i was hearing dialog from both previous and future events.  it was annoying, but not a game-stopper and closing/reopening the game resolved it.  another issue where display of elevators was lagging saw a fix released the very next day (kudos!) 
for me, the user interface seems inconsistent and somewhat clunky.  here are a few examples:  i'm not a fan of holding 'tab' to switch to garden mode, scrolling to select an action, then pressing 'e' to select the seed, etc.  at worst, it can be frustrating determining the mouse/keystrokes needed to perform an action.  at best, it is never something i can do via muscle-memory without thinking.  device production statistics is also not well laid out. even after playing a considerable time i still have to study each machine's statistics to find the bit of information i'm looking for.   one positive, there is an icon in each device that allows focusing it to requirements of pending tasks--love that.  there is also a need for improvement to the main map to add more detail and descriptions.  an item might say it can be found in the quarry, but the quarry is not labelled on the map.  
the above items are minor to me and overall i enjoy this game and highly recommend it.

has everything that portia had but with small changes to the design to make the game more enjoyable! e.g you can place bigger storage boxes on top of the current smaller ones instead of removing everything from inside of the box minecraft style, or when carrying out a quest which requires items on hand, you can still complete it with the items still back at the workshop when in storage!

to keep you interested, the game offers a ton of features and content, such the ability to make hundreds of objects, interact with the locals and fall in love, cultivate crops, battle monsters, and take part in festivals and minigames. the voice acting is funny and well-done, the music is catchy and calming, and the images are vivid and colorful.",15069
2023-11-12,"for the first few hours i was kind of iffy on this game. i love the stardew genre of games though and the initial grid didn't deter me. i'm now 78 hours in and i can safely say this game is an absolute gem. it has everything you'd expect in a game like this, tool progression, a passable combat system, a modest tech tree and progressive efficiency gains, but there are a few things that put it above the rest of the competition within this genre.

1. inventory management is an absolute breeze. when crafting and turning in quests you have access to every item in every chest that you own. furthermore, when you go to any chest in your base to deposit items after a day of gathering, you can press a single button to automatically deposit all like-items into stacks across all of your chests. this game has completely solved the inventory management issue that bogs down mid and late-game in this genre and for that i tip my hat.

2. the writing in this game is phenomenal! the story is pretty bonkers and while being pretty cutesy and family friendly, crams in a lot of humor and some genuinely wild twists and turns. this game isn't high-drama, but it's just so much fun that i can't recommend it enough. the characters are also very well-written and unique.

3. the art design for this game is very unique and i think it'll age fairly well. the customization options you get on your character are pretty fun. i like seeing what other people made their avatars to look like. you also get an outfit tab separate from your equipment tab so you have total freedom to customize your look.

so all that said, there are a few cons that whittle this game down from being perfect to being in the 9/10 bracket.

1. the map is fairly limited in size. you'll spend a lot of time going back and forth through the same areas for dozens of hours.

2. the game is pretty grindy if you're looking to upgrade your farm to the largest possible size. it requires an absolutely diabolical amount of money and there aren't a lot of ways to make said money as easily as you can in stardew valley. there's a barn and coop structure that you can build, but they aren't very good revenue sources; the same can be said about farming. the real way to make money in this game is to fulfill a limited amount of crafting requests each day and then just grind the mines over and over. i wish there were more options for money making or that the farm plot upgrades were cheaper.

overall i really like this game and recommend it strongly if you're a fan of this genre. grit your teeth through the slow start and then enjoy yourself for literal days.",18838
2023-11-10,"greetings,

i actually enjoy this game ~ its fun to play with your partner and ofc for me its good because it has a level system and has dungeons.
the multiplayer still has some small bugs but the devs actually care about this game and keep fixing stuff.

2023-11-10,"  most of the accessible males in this game are overweight or not as good-looking. but most women are thin and good-looking, and their height is exactly the same. can't marriageable women be as diverse as men?

2023-11-12,"*multiplayer review*

i only played a small amount of the single player version before jumping into multiplayer with my wife.  the big difference i noticed right off was that you have to build & populate the town in multiplayer while most of the towns buildings & populous are already there in single.

while it's a really fun game in multiplayer, it is very much a grind.  it took the 2 of us around 60 hours to get every building built & upgraded so if you find grind tedious, this might not be the game for you.  i found the grind tolerable because it's mixed in with other content such as dungeons, farming, caring for pets & mounts, crafting, exploring, events, house/workshop building and story line.  the best feature of multiplayer is that when you set up a multiplayer game, it's just like renting your own server except it costs you nothing.  you can have the game match you with other players or start a new town and chose to let randoms in or set it to invite only.  when you have players join, unlike many other game, you do not have to be online for them to log in and play.  for the amount of play time and content you'll get out of this game, i think the price tag is a fare price but that will be up to you to determine.  if you don't mine the grind, i recommend this game so watch some gameplay or trailers and see if it's for you.",18838
2023-11-12,the game is fun and has a good flow to it. love that you can fight in the open world and not just only in caves. you do have to grind for what you what but that's that point of this kind of game. the only thing that i would change about the game is to make it to where you have to craft a bigger bag rather then pay for one extra slot at a time but. but still 10 out of 10.,18838
2023-11-12,"my time at sandrock is an amazing sequel to my time at portia. it improves on most parts while only keeping a few weaknesses it's predecessor had. to keep it short:

+runs better
+no more inventory management (your machines automatically use items from your chests, and you can scroll through all chests at once), but it still keeps the inventory when gifting items/donating to the museum (why though? please fix this)
+an interesting story (it's nothing groundbreaking, but it keeps you hooked), however the story has 2 plotlines and the 2nd one keeps dragging on for just a bit too long imo (if the pacing was improved, a solid 10 hours of gametime could be cut, which would fix this imo)
+improved overall gameplay (combat is better, mines are now actually designed instead of randomly generated, big enemy variety, several weapon options)
+better cast (i disliked it more in the first few hours, but the more time i put into it, the more i grew to prefer it over the first cast), additionally, the game doesnt shy from adding or taking away characters halfway through the story, keeping the cast fresh
+improved farming, improved pet keeping, improved mount-system and unlockable options to modify your house and workshop from home (no more running to the upgrade-store)

~new building system for housing. originally i liked it a lot, but its very shallow. the lack of options to build as well as the lack of forms for building really put a dent into this for me (no triangles, round houses etc.) and the factory and greenhouse also got worked into this and are now basically quadratic blocks with little to no customization, so they look worse like the old versions but also dont improve on them gameplaywise.
~bigger focus on socializing - the game has a lot of small quests which tell you stories about the individual characters, their relationships with each others and their backstories. i put it in mixed because some people prefer the core gameplay loop, but if you enjoy the social-part, this puts games like sdv in the dust
~bigger focus on combat and platforming - i mentioned earlier that sandrock improved on combat. however, it's still not good. you can work with it, it does what it has to do, but thats it. and focusing a big part of the story on the workable combat and clunky platforming simply doesnt work and is frustrating. personally, those were the most dreadful parts, despite the devs working some of the best ideas into them.

-all those nitpicks i had lead to me feeling like the game was simply not quite finished. it reminded me a lot of baldurs gate 3, where the start was so well thought through and everything worked perfectly but as you got into the later parts of the game it starts to feel as if they didnt work it through enough.
-same goes for performance. the game runs overall a lot better than portia, but as you get into the later parts of the game, you get more bugs, such as textures not loading, small lagspikes and characters not working or completely disappearing.

overall i give sandrock a 7/10. if they fix the bugs and improve on the factory and greenhouse the game can easily become an 8-9/10 and one of the strongest condenders in the genre, next to stardew valley.",18838
2023-11-12,"highly recommend, this game rivals my all time favorite stardew valley. similar mechanics and foundation to my time at portia, but vastly improved graphics and play-ability. i have found all the characters interesting and fun to talk to, missions engaging and thoughtful, and gameplay smooth and cohesive.

i've had this game since christmas last year (so most of my hours were in early access) and the game has only been improved with full release. when i came across a game breaking bug in the afternoon, it was fixed by the next morning. pathea has outdone themselves. i have something like 280 hours played (230 hours on my main file) and am close to completing the main story, but not quite there yet.

i love time sink games like this and the only con i can think of is that sometimes it takes a while to load a new area (exiting the house, going into a dungeon, etc). my understanding is this is going to be further optimized in the future so i have no complaints about this game and can't wait to spend many more hours on it! 10/10 with lots of love",18838
2023-11-12,"i played my time at portia before this and loved it. initially when sandrock was announced, i wasn't excited about playing in the desert. i decided to give it a go anyway because of how much i loved portia. to my surprise, my time at sandrock far surpasses my time at portia. from the story depth, backgrounds of every character, storage, ruin diving, map size, amount of quests, the existence of logan, voice acting, graphics of course and just overall day to day. there is always something to do in sandrock. just for reference, i put 146 hours into my time at portia. i've played 253 hours of my time at sandrock, i'm almost finished with the main story and plan on replaying just to explore all the marriage candidates. 

kudos to the devs for creating such a story rich, beautiful game. they are also amazing at fixing bugs. i spent half of my time playing before full release and picked it back up once it was fully released. it's abundantly clear they care about this game and the players. i can not wait to see what they have in store for us in the future with project me!!!",18838

2023-11-11,"i'm currently playing sandrock with both my pc and steam deck. this game is very well optimized on the steam deck and alternating between pc and steam deck play has never been easier.

2023-11-12,"overall good game. its odd when i hit rock and the ore floats above it, making it difficult to hit and pinpoint with my pickax in the mines at time. the cut scenes can also take an awkward moment to start as the npc sometimes walks around a bit. 
other than small odd things, the game runs great and is very immersive. the characters are all wonderful and i'm obsessed with all of the romance options. improved a lot from my time at portia as well, the grinding feels less grindy.",18838
2023-11-11,"this game is so much fun  - it looks cute and it has a lot of heart. the unique desert setting allows for gameplay that differs a little from the classic farming sim, and you can tell the developers have put a lot of thought into it (e.g., what would farming look like in the desert?). the storyline is interesting with a bit of mystery, the characters are enjoyable, and combat is fun. overall, this game is an improvement on my time at portia - which was also great - with a world that players can go to relax and have fun.",18231
2023-11-11,"i first played this game near the beginning of its alpha, and comparing that experience to now (since it's fully released) is crazy. seeing the sheer amount of content & care the team has put into it since then is truly impressive and i'm having a great time so far. i'm a big fan of this genre and i can see myself playing sandrock more than portia and likely more than any of the other chill life sims out there. also, it makes me feel a little hopeful about a potential world state after our climate falls apart, so there's that too!",18231

2023-11-11,"i enjoyed my time at portia, so i backed this on kickstarter.

now, i wish i hadn't. the game is extremely poorly optimized. it makes my computer run way harder than it should, even on lower graphics settings. i could only stomach to play 15-20 minutes before giving up. i waited until the 1.0 release to give  this a fully try and i'm incredibly disappointed.

if they can update it with some optimization patches, i'll give it a second chance, but i don't expect that will happen. even my time at portia was poorly optimized, but it wasn't this bad.",18231
2023-11-11,"this is a review on the multiplayer side of the game. i never tried the single player mode.
solid game. surprisingly large amount of content and good quality throughout. 

quest done almost always add value to your gameplay and town and not just a exp/gold farm like what quest in games usually do. grinding doesnt feel like a chore as you are rewarded well for it. as for how much things there is to do in the game, the only answer is yes. after 30hrs in, i still never run out of things to do, super addicting. 

combat is fairly simple and suit a game like this, where building and developing your town is the main goal. dungeons are pretty fun to go through, the bosses have mechanics and not just a mob with large hp pool which was surprising as well. however, most fights is just a stat fight (whether you have enough stats/heals), dodging doesnt feel that important in the game and it doesnt even feel rewarding to dodge attacks as you can just tank through everything anyways with enough stats and heals and kill the mob faster. however, it is understandable as it is a rather casual friendly game. however if the devs decide to make the combat more interactive rather than a stat fight in the future, i am all for it. also guns are fun and all, needing to use ads to shoot is not fantastic.

last and the biggest selling point for me, dedicated servers. it makes it easy to have friends play in the same town anytime as everyone has their own lifes and can play at different timings. unlike many of the sandbox games that only supports p2p as default.",18231
2023-11-10,"i'll come back later once i have the words to explain every thing but for now
 
this game is amazing, a little rough around the edges but leagues better than portia. like, scary how much better it is than portia!
and i dare say even, this even manage to surpass stardew valley in my heart. all the story stuff, the characters, the romance. its just so fun, it's so cozy. 

this game makes me very happy",15092
2023-11-10,"if you're a fan of stardew valley, harvest moon, rune factory or any of the similar games and are really wanting to find yourself a decent game, this one is pretty great. if you've play my time at portia, lemme just summarize and say that this... is a much better game than that one was. 

it does have the odd bug now and again, but the devs are actively listening to player feedback and are cranking out patches to fix as many issues as they can. currently multiplayer is having some issues and there are some performance issues at least when it comes to load times (especially cutscenes).

there's gathering, building, monster fighting (which is almost too ez at this time), pets, romance, events, characters with depth (for the most part), transmog for outfits, home decor/building and even children! theres a lot and apparently they're hinting at adding even more and/or fleshing more out.

2023-11-12,"[h1] my time at sandrock: an amazingly massive game, a great story line, and some occasional faults. ~ [/h1]

[h3] okay, so i have obviously played this game a lot, and it's because it is that good! if you're a return player from portia, i can confirm to you that sandrock is a massive upgrade in almost all aspects! if you have never played a game in the my time at series, don't worry! you absolutely do not have to play portia to enjoy sandrock! after over 200 hours of game play, here's my major takeaways ~ [/h3]

[u] the great ~ [/u] 

[b] the story line [/b]
- sandrock has a really great main story quest line, with enough twist and turns to keep you interested and immersed. it truly was a pleasure to play through it! there's a good mix of resource gathering, social aspects, combat, farming, and advancement required that keeps you motivated to continue grinding towards completion. also, if you're a return player from portia, i personally believe that sandrock has a better story line, and has increased difficulty.
[b] the characters [/b]
- wow! sandrock truly has some very colorful characters! without giving anything away, these side characters have a variety of personalities that are genuinely fun to interact with. in a lot of other games from this genre i tend to stop talking to a lot of the npcs around town, but i actually like hearing what the characters in sandrock have to say! it also helps that every character is given new unique dialogue after progress in the story is made, so they're not just constantly spouting the same lines all the time, regardless of development. there's a lot of great romance options as well, with there being someone for everyone. 
[b] the dialogue [/b]
- there's no other way to say this ~ this game just has straight up hilarious lines! from a farmer who's a part-time conspiracy theorist to a rock obsessed wannabe deputy, there's no shortage of great lines from the characters around the game. the dialogue also makes you want to befriend more of the citizens to see their extra events because of how hilarious they can be. your player character can even give some golden one-liners as the game progresses! 
[b] the grind [/b] 
- you really have to get involved in all aspects of the game when playing. you're going to need a lot of wood to complete projects, i mean, you are a builder. however, sandrock is desolate and cutting down trees and cacti is a big no-no. this means you have to cut down tiny bushes, dead logs, etc. which do not give you a lot of resources, meaning you've got to keep at the grind! also, as you unlock more areas and more of the story, you find yourself having to go back to previous ruins/areas in order to get different types of materials, as they're not in the same place. don't forget that water powers all of your machines, so you have to keep your tank full in the middle of the desert! 

[u] the lacking~ [/u]

[b] the family issue [/b]
- in short, because there's so many elements in sandrock, they eventually fizzle out in unsatisfactory ways. a good example can be seen with married and family life, which is just not fleshed out enough. considering characters around the game continuously sing praises towards your character, and comment on the various things going on around, it's strange that basically nobody acknowledges your spouse and children. so far, there's no family events, and once your children exit the baby stage, you literally never see them interact with anyone, including your spouse. they wake up and essentially go to one place (the train station) for the entire day.  it would've been nice to have them as actual members of the town, with their own events as they age, and a routine that mimics other npcs. as for your spouse, the married events currently in game are very boring and out of place for some characters. i would really love to see married life and family life be more fleshed out in the future, whether in another my time game, or in an expansion/update! i would rather have less romance options and just one child if that means that the additional content that comes with them would be stronger. 
[b] character favoritism + strange depth [/b]
- it's very obvious that, because of fan reception, some characters are more favored than others. by this i mean that they have way more content. take fang and logan as an example. both characters are fan favorites, and they have some really cool events! these events also work really well with what has been presented with their characters, which gives not only their characters, but the game, more depth. it really makes you believe that they had a life before you, and have a life despite you. i suppose this makes me more critical of the other characters in the game. director qi is a good example of this. you actually get to know so much about his character! for example, he's the grandson of a successful scientist who appears to be very strict, his parent's had more ""lowly"" jobs in comparison and qi appears to sort of look down on them, and he even states that his parents were shocked to find out that you exist (if you romance him), and that when he was younger he calculated that there was only a 3.14% chance of him finding love. these all combine to create such an interesting character, and gives you a plethora of ideas of how his character will/can progress. however, despite these tidbits that you can gather, that's basically it. his character, as well as a large portion of characters in the game, plateau. this is what i mean about strange depth, it's like they had more planned for certain characters, and it just never came to fruition. i was so certain when romancing qi's character that there was going to be some really cool events regarding his past, him falling in love with you, having children of his own, etc., and it just never happened. it honestly was a big disappointment because i saw all the makings of a great side story for a lot of the romance-able characters, but it's just not there. 

[h3] in conclusion, i honestly feel like i have so much more to say, which isn't surprising considering how much i loved the game. additionally, i would say that because i love the game and series so much i am probably more critical of it in certain ways! i think that's truly the hallmark sign of a great game, liking it so much that you want to make certain changes to perfect it! all in all, sandrock was truly an amazing experience and i would recommend it to all lovers of the genre. however, keep in mind that there are going to be aspects of the game that will leave you frustrated. these frustrations, at least for me, have a lot to do with the fact that i just want more! keep it up devs! you're doing great sweeties, and the improvement from portia is massive!

2023-11-11,"overall, i recommend the game - 480 hours played across early release - but that doesn't mean the game is perfect. much has been made of the voiceover issues with this game, so i'll bypass those, other than to add that changing the voiceover artist for later updates compounded the issue.

it's less clunky (although arguable less realistic, as a consequence) than its predecessor, my time at portia, which may make for a less than satisfying experience for anyone who chooses to play that game after this one. the characters in sandrock are less bobble-headed, too, which is an improvement. portia and sandrock happen in a simultaneous timelime, which leads to some quietly-amusing references to, effectively, your portia character at points during sandrock, another reason to consider playing portia first.

of the five bachelors i romanced, three of them exhibited behaviour that, in real life, should set major alarm bells ringing, which is quite concerning. a couple of the npcs are genuinely unlikeable, which is fine and reflective of real life; but i found myself resenting completing lucrative contracts for one of them by late game, as their relationship with me continued to increase even as my loathing of them grew.

as i did play this through early release, some things may have changed by full release, but a few niggly annoyances stood out: at times, lucrative commissions for machinery would appear on the commission board; but without having any in-game ability to know what was required to complete construction, it was quite frustrating to accept these commissions, research the manufacturing plans, discover you needed more advanced equipment yourself, research that, then find that you needed components you either didn't have materials for, or didn't have the ability to make. in one instance, the 'base' instructions for making the refined material i needed to make one component didn't even become available until nearly two months after i'd failed the commission. if the capacity to complete the commission doesn't exist, don't make it available.

secondly, there were times when it became impossible to complete tasks because the final act clashed with some other event. some of these may have since been resolved. in a related annoyance, there are times when the pc wakes up with awareness of events it is literally impossible for them to have any knowledge of. often this is minor: calendar events added on rising in the morning that are explained when mail is read. occasionally, however, these are quite significant. just as bed, there are some events involving npcs that clearly acknowledge the passage of a significant period of time (a minimum two weeks would be essential in one case), yet those events conclude within a day or so. then there is the issue of being 'transported' to major events when you get up. on one occasion, running back home after such an event, i encountered a minor task simply by talking with an npc that i had no means of answering because the task was outlined in a letter i hadn't yet had a chance to read. more concerningly, the non-committal answer i gave may have broken the character, who never moved from the spot i encountered him for the remainder of the game, unless needed elsewhere.

the nanny-nag that says ""you can't use that possibly rude word!"" when naming things in single-player is both ludicrous and offensive: i'm an adult, not six years old, and i can make my own decisions. if it's important that any vaguely-implied rudeness must be leapt on with extreme prejudice, then i would suggest that eliminating toxic behaviours from a multitude of npcs would be a better use of censorship - especially if (and i am forced to assume that this must be the case) the game makers are trying to avoid corrupting sweet childish innocence.

similarly, an in-game swimwear fashion show basically designed to sell dlcs is both sexist and cowardly in dressing the female models in bikins and the males in shorts. the game designers may have jumped on the 'it's okay to be gay"" bandwagon; but their moral code is severely lacking in other areas (most particularly regarding toxic behaviours).

one in-game shop has a link to actual character figurines on amazon: if you follow the link you find that you're being asked to pay an offensively-large amount of money for a blind-box figurine, so that's a definitive 'no' on both counts. still, that annoyance is easily-avoided, although it does make me less-inclined to consider buying other pathea games products, up to and including dlcs, so they may like to rethink their approach.

yes, i have concentrated on the negatives in this review. on the positive side, the game is immensely-playable. for an obsessive such as me, there is always something to do, with the essential wait-times scattered throughout the game usually not too much of a trial. some npcs are clearly on the autism spectrum, and this is treated respectfully (albeit occasionally with not-unreasonable impatience) by other npcs and player choices, which is to be commended. apart from some built-in sexism, the character design is generally appealing, and the capacity to 'hide the hat' via the settings is appreciated: having put a lot of effort into designing my character, i like being able to see them. the storylines are often engaging, although i wish the character-based relationship-building tasks had a time expiry if unselected, because having them sit constantly on the map when i have no interest in following them through is annoying.

in summary, an enjoyable, very playable game with a number of flaws, some of them significant.",18231
2023-11-11,"the four players per town multiplayer is an interesting idea. however, when work got busy my wife didn't have anyone to play with, because i was in the town taking up a spot. it was a very painful decision for her to remove me from the town so that she had people who were just as excited to play as she was.

2023-11-11,"do not buy, extremely buggy game.

i really enjoyed my time at portia (mtap), and found that sandrock (mtas) has extended much of the gameplay. the interaction system is fine, and the crafting system is basically identical. most of the game is good (hence my recent post-release play of ~90 hours (~20hrs was during the beta)). the fishing is so much better in mtas, it's a great improvement.

however, as the game goes on, more and more bugs arise. i've found that the game starts to chug after long play sessions (5+hrs) and needs to be restarted just to transition between scenes more smoothly. i've had several days where the game just hangs because when you leave your house in the morning it's supposed to cut to a cutscene, but the cutscene doesn't start, and so the game just sits on a black screen. sometimes restarting the game helped, otherwise i had to restart my computer (this indicates that mtas isn't releasing resources it finished using).

on the non-bugs front: the dialogue is often just bad. while i don't mean characters like unsuur who are just intentionally odd (and pretty funny), the entire bronco the kid arc is just immensely painful to play through. i appreciate that this was probably attempting to be silly, it's just a conversation that actual humans would never have with each other.

there are a lot of ""popins"" = graphics that just 'pop' into existence, but should have been there beforehand. exiting a building (eg the museum) leaves you standing outside an empty lot until the game loads in the building. this is not a modern fps, a quick look at the sceenshots will quickly show that the graphics in this game are very basic, no dlss in sight. yet buildings (and people) are often loaded in very slowly, taking 2-3 seconds to fully load each time you fast travel. this seems small until you realise that you will be fast travelling multiple times per day, every day, so this issue is constantly in your face.

npcs don't exist in the world. or rather, they do until they need to be somewhere else, and then they teleport. one of the things that i enjoyed in mtap was watching the townsfolk sprint across town to get to a gathering. in addition to being fun to watch, it also meant you could intercept them during their schedule to interact with them. this largely doesn't happen any more, they're simply teleported to where they need to be. this, frankly, is just absolute garbage, and leads to a bunch of issues.

an example: heidi and i are married in the game, and i have a quest to give her an item. according to my map, she's at the game centre, so i hop on my horse and head over there. as i approach the games centre, the quest marker jumps back to my workshop: she's there to pick up all the completed items from my machine. so i turnaround and head back to my workshop. as i pass the train station, the quest marker jumps *back* to the game centre: heidi finished her workshop tasks, and her schedule has her at the games centre so she teleports again.

in mtap, i would have met heidi on her way, but in mtas it's impossible.

in addition to that, npcs will just randomly teleport around. if you hang around the main square in front of the town hall, justice and trudy will just randomly materialise there. this is an entirely reasonable thing to do if npcs get stuck on objects, but 1) it's happening all the goddamn time, and 2) coco gets stuck on objects in my workshop all the time, yet never teleports.

this is before we talk about a game-breaking bug that has halted my current play. two events were supposed to occur on two different days, but the first didn't trigger on the correct day, so now they've both blended and are happening at the same time. this has caused the game to lose its sh~t, and spin my camera out into the desert, where it just sits and ignores all input from me.

all in all, this game is riddled with bugs, and has serious foundational flaws in its design. i bought this game in early access on the strength of mtap, and (frankly) i regret doing so.

edited to respond to dev comment: it *is* installed on an ssd. you seem to be saying that it's even worse on an hdd.....",18231
2023-11-11,"after loving my time at portia, i had great hopes for the sequel my time at sandrock and waited for release to experience it to the fullest and i'm not disappointed at all ! 

my time at sandrock takes the serie to a whole other level, and i'm here for it. although the gameplay is a bit similar to my time at portia, they were a lot of improvements, but the biggest improvements for me are the story and character design and developpements. i have grown way more attached to the town and it's habitants than with portia, and have had a blast bringing sandrock to it's former glory !

2023-11-10,an awesome cozy game. it has enough challenge to keep you interested without stressing you out. the multiplayer definitely helps a lot to achieve the quests. user friendly and entertaining :),15092
2023-11-11,"having played portia, and having played this a bit while in ea, i can definitively say that this is a straight upgrade in many ways compared to the previous game and that time spent in ea was well spent to make a generally well-polished experience on release. 

the thing that stood out to me as vastly improved in comparison to portia is the combat, which, for a game that has utilized this mechanic in a more intimate way that other farming/building/life simulation games, i think really nails the good balance in necessity to being enjoyable to engage with. especially when you start upgrading the combat skills, getting more combos, getting the flow of the enemy actions and dodging and timing strikes, while not particularly profound, still feels enjoyable and far more engaging than the previous games and others in the same genre i've experienced. it feels simple enough though that even if you're not really playing this game to partake in the combat-portion of the game, it's easy enough to out-level the enemies by performing other tasks that simple button mashing to get the mats you need from lower level monsters won't pose much of an obstacle.

outside of combat, i've always enjoyed the commission system in both games, and i think it serves well here for giving yourself a sense of progression and direction. while being rewarding enough that, while being somewhat repetitive in what you'll be building for the various residents of sandrock, serves more as the foundation for pursuing other enjoyable ventures like upgrading your workshop, buying mats that you need either directly at stores or commissioning deliveries while giving you enough of a reward in not only the money you need, but additional materials and easy relationship improvements outside of the, arguably, rather shallow and repetitive npc conversational engagements quickly enough to give you variety in other things to do without feeling like too much of a grind.

the story is also rather cute, if not a bit on the simple side, which imo, is fine for what it is - it gives you a further sense of purpose and a meaningful way to progress unlockable areas, residents, and mechanics. i feel several of the npcs have notable quirks that make them memorable enough to want to engage with them and their missions, although at times, even with the characters that are not designed to be long-winded (like cooper), i found myself wanting to read the dialog faster than i wanted to hear it from them because there's just something about the way they talk and the flow that just made me frequently want to skip it. can't really put my finger on why exactly, but this was especially true when interacting with them daily during the regular chat interactions. with that said though, one really nice touch is how npcs all have their own individual reactions to story events that are enjoyable to listen to, even if they can be a bit long-winded sometimes. it's a nice touch to detail that somewhat makes your accomplishments in the game feel more relevant to your place in the world.

lastly, while i haven't played much of it since ea, the multiplayer seems way more polished (and was non-existent in the previous game) and has been pretty fun so far. if you've got friends to play with, while it's completely separate from the base instance of the game, the co-op workspace and co-op commissions and being able to engage in spelunking and combat with friends gives it a fresh feel from the base, single-player, portion of the game.

[h3][u]tl:dr[/u][/h3]
- solid improvement from the previous game in almost every way.
- combat improvements especially feel much better from previous games.
- story is fine, albeit a bit on the simple side. more focus made on the mechanics.
- many npcs are memorable in their own way if not a bit long-winded and the base chat mechanic is a bit bleh but the ""play"" mechanics make up for it a bit (albeit, get a bit repetitive with the limited options and expensive energy costs to engage in them). 
- multiplayer is a separate instance from the base, single-player, game, but having all the same mechanics being applied while playing with friends has, so far, been a very enjoyable experience and is way more polished than when it was introduced in ea.",18231
2023-11-11,"worth the wait!! i held off until most of the game was ready because i loved portia and i wanted to experience sandrock in full. with over 300hrs played, it's one the best games i've played in years!! everything they wanted to fix from portia, they did. i can't say enough good things and i hope anyone who was excited for this game gives it a try! a++++",18231

2023-11-11,"while i'm having a great time with it, and in many ways it's an upgrade over portia, i cannot in good conscience reccommend the game in it's current state. 

bugs, technical issues and performance issues are everywhere, despite claiming to be a full release after an early access period. 

teleporting / weirdly moving characters, duplicating items, invisible walls with no explanation, non functional area transitions, extremely slow asset loading (why does a game with <5% of the complexity have massive pop in issues compared to something like cyberpunk on a good ssd?), overlapping timed events, tooltips that are straight up wrong (why does upgrading my crafting table to level 3 say i'm going to unlock copper pots when i've been able to make those all along?), events on a fixed time line happening out of order, items you're meant to interact with going invisible, quests referencing things you haven't unlocked yet, weapons being extremely poorly balanced, crafting system loosing track of what you need to make and when (the quick crafting option would be great if it didn't bug out 90% of the time by telling you to make parts for things you already have)... i could go on.

despite the ea period, the game seems to have no meaningful qa testing whatsoever, as most issues i've found would've been obvious to anyone playing for a few hours.

there is a good game under all the issues, but again, i can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone until most of these (really basic) problems are fixed.",18231
2023-11-10,"i would highly recommend this lovely game! received the early access as a birthday gift! games like these i love. though i had to reduce everything to lowest quality in the options because of my internet issues and pc being old in tech standards. low or high quality graphics, still love it.",15092
2023-11-10,yeehaw i approve,15092
2023-11-10,love this game! hours of fun.,15092
2023-11-10,finally a game i really like.,15092
2023-11-10,very addictive - you get so many tasks and i do not know how the game manages to motivate you to do them,15092
2023-11-10,47 hours in and i know i'll be putting in more than double that still! i am hooked!!,15092
2023-11-10,"unfinished, in my opinion. i would describe this as ""unity jank in perpetual early access"" 

the yawning blackness within doorways feels awkward. the music's abrupt shifts between scenes and loading screens add to the awkwardness. cut scenes feature jarring transitions. the concept of the ruins is goofy, with all the intellectual stimulation of one of those archaeology sand-treasure toys for toddlers. digging dirt towards an icon and walking through black doors, hitting buttons for more icons—repeat ad nauseam. fishing is oddly implemented. the repetitive, brown environment is a monotonous downer. two resources to manage for crafting: water and fuel. why? you don't have to do much to manage either of them so i just don't even understand why it exists other than bloat. the furniture is bulky, occupying too much space without purpose. the game lacks a clear identity, failing to embody a competent farming sim, resource management game, or social game. the kids in the game all give me the creeps.

the english localization is spotty with errors that should have been fixed long ago. in-game advertisements (with grammatical errors!!) direct to external websites, including amazon pages. they also beg for reviews via in-game advertisements. the inaccurate wiki diminishes the quality of available online information.

despite these issues, i'll persist in playing because i enjoy this genre. if i hadn't known it wasn't in early access, i would have unquestioningly believed it still was. if you have ""switch store bloatware"" standards for games, you will probably be fine with this release. i neither recommend nor advise against this game. 

it should 100% be cheaper though.

p.s. i forgot to add this stupidity: when you walk into the edge of the water, the entire screen goes black and then you reappear at the edge of the water. if you walk in a second time in the same place, your character gets teleported to the center of town. i'm guessing this is because they intended to implement swimming at some point but just couldn't figure it out and so you get teleported as a failsafe to prevent your character from getting stuck. honestly, what happened to invisible walls?",15092
2023-11-10,"this sequal to my time at portia happens to be as good as, if not better than my time at portia.
the game has tons of improvements, tons of new features and mechanics, tons of quality of life additions, and more that were not in my time at portia.
furthermore it has a much more detailed and exquisite crafting system, farming system, construction system, and combat system, all of which is easy to learn because it wasn't made very complex.
there is also tons of in game tutorials and means to look back at past information, so the player will not get lost as easily as they did in my time at portia.
this game is a massive improvement in many ways. perhaps the only complaint the player could ever have is water management, and even then, for a player that is willing to learn and understand water conservation, a player will learn how to easily manage their water reserves with time and never run out of water (which will take a long time for people who have extreme difficulty with extremely basic management skills and extremely basic learning skills).
in any case, i have been playing this game since closed beta, i was a kickstarter backer, and i think the full release is infinitely superior to the beta, and it is way better than my time at portia, though it is reasonable to understand that the water management system is treated as the reason many people say this game is worse than my time at portia... it is probably the only downside to this game.
everything else is an improvement. if you love the idea of playing a game where you live in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland and are actively working towards rebuilding civilization and restoring the environment to a pristine green condition and don't mind the occasional combat scenario this game is for you.",15092
2023-11-10,"""my time at portia"" was an apparently simple game, and yet it provided a surprisingly deep experience.
after playing for a good while, it's obvious the developers at pathea games took everything they've learned from the project and put it into ""my time at sandrock"".
this new title has been improved over the original in every way possible: graphics, artstyle, combat, animations, activities, characters, story... the list covers literally every single aspect of the game, and even if there's still some rough edges here and there, they're very minor and don't hinder at all the quality of the product.

the game combines life-style (housing, crafting, resource gathering, bonding with other characters...) with action/adventure gameplay (exploration, rpg elements, dungeons, boss fights...). all the while, the city of sandrock grows and develops over time and as the story goes forward, with your contribution.
there's also a dedicated multiplayer mode, focusing exclusively on everything revolving around managing your workshop (no story progression, unfortunately, but the fact it's there as an option to have fun with friends in a game that doesn't really need multiplayer, is already more than enough).

if you're in for a fun, hopeful, wholesome and pleasant adventure filled with likeable characters in a vibrant, living world that makes you truly feel a part of it, then there's no reasons not to give this game a try. 
you'll be genuinely suprised by seeing how much care, affection and attention to details have been put into crafting this little gem and what it has to offer.
the part where you're a builder, tasked with gathering resources and building things is truly just part of the tip of a huge iceberg.

even at full price, it's well worth the money.",15092
2023-11-10,"i love the game, i spent 35 hours on the beginning of early access and then i decided to wait for the game to be released in 1.0. after 12h in 1.0 the game as a lot of problems and it looks like it's still in the same stage as early access.

- poor optimization (i7-10700k + rtx 2080 super).
- random little loading times (loading inventory or talking to people).
- buildings that disappear and respawn after a few seconds.
- the french translation is not very good.
- multiplayer is just a sandbox with no story, success, or romance etc..

i really liked my time at portia and i really like sandrock but all these small/big problems make the game less pleasant to play.
why release a game from early access if it's still so poorly optimized and full of bugs?

hopefully, future updates will make the game more stable and less frustrating.",15092
2023-11-10,"this game is enjoyable... it's better than my time at portia, but only barely. the writing is genuinely good and voice acting is great. the characters themselves look great as well. inventory is improved but i am not sure that warrants immense praise in a sequel, i would expect more mechanical improvements. the characters are definitely more demanding and engaged. some times i wish they would honestly shove off though, a lot of them are deeply self centered and narcissistic. it's an attempt to show a more realistic community i guess, but so many of them track anti-social and deeply narcissistic that i am not sure who i actually like in the town. kudos i guess on making it feel like i really am in a backwater trash town.

but i waited a long time for it to leave early access, and now i am playing a game that still feels like it is in early access. 

additionally, level design feels very strange. the over world feels janky and the dungeons half baked in design. a lot of areas blocked by invisible walls and lazy graphics.

the town itself is not particularly impressive and walking away from locations feels like i am walking on an unfinished map. many locations are deeply confusing to find and there are many absolutely pointless time wasting caves that have absolutely nothing in them except maybe a chest that drops a pointless piece of loot.

enemy's feel buggy and some of them are massively annoying to fight with a melee weapon. hyena's jump and move constantly, rat men spawn in the air and can't be attacked. combat is definitely more engineered from portia but it doesn't necessarily feel better chasing around a enemy that essentially non-stop roll dodges.

the denizens look better, but you look like a carnival clown. why are we still throwing utility pouches on things like they are 90s super heroes? why can't anyone make a decent pare of pants, i'm tired of running around in ill fitting shorts. i feel like you should be able to reskin the armor in the game to others you have unlocked. maybe that is a thing but it isn't apparent.

----

response to developer:
there are several instances where the corners of the paradise lost (i believe, first combat dungeon) has areas that look traversable that aren't. the fence going into paradise lost looks scalable. walking into the gecko station there is a large dead space around the entrance that can't be walked through, you have to approach the station entrance straight on dead center to enter. aside from that there are several areas that just seems empty though accessible including caves with little reward for exploring them. feels more like i am punished for exploring in a game at least partial about time management, i now default look up a guide the second i am confused. often the guide itself is confused like in the case with of the quest ""whispers of the heart"" where the streamer enters the cave thinking it might be where the quest location is. understandable since heidi appears to lead you there but then disappears (got stuck on terrain in my game) teleportating to the location but with no quest marker except a zone on the map. a quest with no timer listed but which logically does need to be completed that day and fails if not completed.

speaking of quests that need to be completed on time, there are a ton that auto trigger by walking into zones and they can overlap with other quests you have happening. perhaps you designed this to encourage players to not do quests saving them for future playthrough, but i don't think the majority of your users do play the game more than once. games this scale are huge timesinks and i would like to not decline side plot character arc stuff simply because i have 3 of them going simultaneously.the pacing of quests simply doesn't feel in line with the default speed of the game. i understand i can adjust this but i would like the game at least defaulting to an optimal experience. this likely goes into my feelings towards the townfolk being off putting, berating me with quests that really seem like they should be commissions (owen being the biggest offender though also not being told to stop like the others).

after experiencing the combat more i think the problem is the lack of mobility in the main character during a fight. you feel dark souls speed while everyone else (non-duel) feels like they are playing an arcade beat-em up.

i realize now there is a wardrobe tab, not sure how i missed it. apologies for that criticism. now i can wear my button up (with strange disco medalion/compass) and pants like a normie.

i think some of my irritation is the above mentioned side quest pacing. a lot of characters don't really grow much and feel very one sided in their relationship with you, qi in particular is deeply narcissistic and so central to the plot. there are definitely great characters but the ones who have big character flaws very rarely if ever showcase anything redeeming. would be satisfying to be able to get back at yan even a little and i have been playing the game for an in game year. arvio really needs to not be a screw up once in a while. amirah has 0 warmth even after being stuck making 50 fireworks for an event no one shows up to she responds to with a trailing ellipsis. i mean what is the player expectation here? if it's just the clique getting together to watch fireworks than why not have that happen? if it's a setup for a date why does amirah respond to even the most mild show of affection with a trailing ellipsis? how long do you want me to humor this fleeting youth club when they don't show up to their own events and, if it's a romance line, don't seem interested in you? i feel like i am doing a huge number of quests just to up relationship points, not because i enjoy them.

when's justice going to not be a failure riding off others? i'd love him to show some reason why anyone would want him as sheriff. miguel is a psycho. fang drugs me for his own amusement.

final complaint, clay and bloodstone are deeply relied on for commissions. they are very difficult to source without going back to the first dungeon or buying some from a store behind a loading screen. i have so much stone and sand at this point i could forge another sandrock in an effort to source clay and bloodstone and this is with me having built up a ton of bloodstone building a ridiculous field of moisture farms and needing the marble (p.s. please let us automate collection from these or something...).",15092

i am praying. please let this series continue.",15069
2023-11-09,"if you played my time at portia and enjoyed it - you'll love this one! tons of quality of life features have gone in that make it a blast to play, especially with inventory management which is one of the biggest factors of this type of game (such as naming your chests, and an ability to ""just stack similar items from my inventory into any of my chests"") 

in comparison to something such as stardew valley (love!) i would say it's similar but different. sandrock isn't a farming sim for one - it's mostly focused on you being a builder. so it's a lot more on getting a workshop, crafting, setting up automation, etc. 
of course there is still animal rearing and farming that can be had! but it's not the primary focus. 

the world is still a great time, the characters in the city are fantastic (and voice acted often!) and a blast to go out on dates, have lunch with, or just say howdy in the town for. 

the combat is rather enjoyable as well! makes monster battling more enjoyable than many other games of this style. 

big tip i'd have: if you find the days going by too quick (or too slow), you can change the gameplay speed! i found at first a little overwhelmed as i was trying to do commissions each day & by the time i finished, i was running out of daylight! but then i just changed the gameplay speed (0.7 is my sweet spot i think) and it's just the perfect amount for me. 

overall, if you like cozy life sim's where you can just sit back, relax and enjoy yourself. would recommend :)",15069

2023-11-09,"please note that i am a kickstarter backer.

sandrock improves on portia by leaps and bounds. it takes the addicting loop of gathering resources to build machines to finish projects to build better machines to work with other resources and wraps it in a cozy blanket of interesting npcs and a deep setting. 

this is not a farming game. even though it will inevitably be compared to stardew and the wave of other similar games that have been released over the years, this is not a farming game. to me personally, sandrock is much closer to modded minecraft, factorio, or satisfactory. what you do get, inspired by stardew (harvest moon, shout out to the og) and its legacy, are npcs to talk to and romance, quests to fulfil for said npcs, and regular festivals.

i personally enjoy the very clear loop of resource gathering and refinement to fulfil quests immensely. like portia (as rough around the edges as it was), sandrock is very good at finding the balance between regular resource gathering to make any progress, without becoming too grindy (but! i'd guess i am in the latter first third of the game, so who knows if this stays true). resources can be acquired in many ways, and there's always one that is easiest or most enjoyable to do. 

npcs feel much deeper than in your average cozy farming game, with several of them having their own agency beyond reacting to your input. you might want to romance one of the bachelorettes, but she might not be sure that it's something that fits into her or your life - and so you have to do quests and navigate dialogue to figure the problem out together.
many of the npcs also step out of the typical archetypes as you get to know them, or offer archetypes from the get-go that aren't often used in these types of games. 

i thoroughly enjoy the writing, which i did not expect to this amount. i certainly liked portia, but i feel like the localisation of sandrock is a big improvement (except for not giving us qi's or fang's full names!). there are plenty of references to popular culture that actually made me chuckle. 

several - but not all - voice actors are also doing a fantastic job. i had pen written off as uninteresting from the start, but his voice actor is doing an incredible job with his character, and i have come to enjoy him much more than i thought. however, some voice actors keep throwing me off with their line deliveries, or their accents. nothing i could not see beyond or that would fully break immersion, but still noticeable if contrasted with the excellent other cast members.

at time of writing this review, i have played through 1.5 seasons in about 30 hours of gameplay. i do not rush any quests and make full use of the non-existent deadlines for major plot quests. i feel like i am just about have the plot open up for me, and have not even arrived at later content that is hailed to be the best. i'm certainly looking forward to experiencing the rest of this game, and would recommend this game to anyone.",15069
2023-11-09,"i liked ""my time at portia"" in spite of what it needed still in terms of polish. it was an ambitious game with many of the things it tried felt mostly half baked and not fully flushed out.

i can happily say that ""my time at sandrock"" not only meets the levels set up by it's predecessor, but also far exceeds them. 

first, the game proudly sticks with it's theme. every aspect of this is themed around you being in a desert, from basic crafting to even fishing. on a side note, this is easily the better fishing mini games i've played, but i wont spoil how that works.

second, the story is very engaging. ~50ish hours in, i'm very immersed in the setting and very motivated to keep going. the characters all seem to have their own motivations and there's a plethora of areas where their quests have pay off, both big and small. the small, being a mark of true craftsmanship.

third, the relationship mechanics are fantastic. they don't expand the barebones from the previous game (if it ain't broke don't fix it) but there's more to do around sandrock than portia. i do have a favorite addition though [spoiler] you literally hold hands with your partner when you're out on a date, they'll keep up with you as you run. this is the cutest damn thing in the world. bless whomever pushed that to get in because it was worth it.[/spoiler] 

if you've played the sequel, than this should be a no brainer. if you've not played the series, if not, i'd probably recommend going with the previous game first, but don't let that stop you if you're eager to start. there's nothing in portia that's critical for sandrock to be enjoyable.",15069
2023-11-09,"multiplayer has zero story missions and zero achievements, which they do not tell you before you buy!! i only bought this game to play with my bf, and we had a lot of fun building our home together and improving the town, but we were extremely disappointed that we cannot experience the story together, and with nearly 40 hours into the game, we still haven't unlocked a single achievement. i will never play this game solo, i am only interested in playing multiplayer, and i feel cheated out of the full experience. if they add story missions and achievements to multiplayer, then i will change my review to recommended.",15069
2023-11-09,"this is a tremendously satisfying game about harvesting materials, crafting, completing tasks, and helping a town prosper.  it's easy to see just a few hours in just how much thought has gone into the systems.  there's plenty to do to fill a day, and new main and side quests pop up on the regular to keep you moving forward.  the game respects your time with convenient tooltips, tutorials, and things like paying to expand your bags directly from your inventory, or being able to complete objectives with materials in your storage.

the social aspect of the game is also surprisingly strong.  the characters are often interesting and the writing is genuinely funny.  there's an interplay of story and gameplay as certain events will cause prices of goods to fluctuate or prompt a community response.  there are mini-activities to do with townsfolk to increase affinity and neat holidays.  there's also lore bits here and there that i did not expect to be as poignant as they are. 

there is combat, and it is fine, but i do not think that is the main draw.  my only complaints would be nitpicks.  the random character customization produces some nightmarish results, and the house expansion system is somewhat fiddly.  

this is a strong recommend.",15069
2023-11-09,"nice game...but co-op sucks because is just a boring ""sandbox"" with no history.",15069
2023-11-09,"edit: between patches and system dedication i have managed to stretch the crashes out to 90 minutes making the game playable. 

game not ready for full release. performance testing is not complete. game crashes on average about every 15 minutes. there is also a little shuddering and pop in at times.

also huge step up from my time at portia!",15069
2023-11-15,"truly an amazing adventure i can recommend to anyone who likes farming/town building games 
its one of a kind",8270
2023-11-15,"the best, chillest game ever!",8270
2023-11-15,i dont know if this game is just more fleshed out or something but i got really bored with my time at portia and this one i havent at all. ive played for about 2 or 3 days now and it just keeps getting better. i do wish/hope there are more customization for the npcs,8270
2023-11-09,"      as someone who has played their fair share of life simulation games, with the variety of animal crossing, stardew valley, and palia to be some of the main ones, this game comes very close to beating them all. i was thrilled to find out that this game was going to have multiplayer in it, seeing as my time at portia does not have multiplayer, which heavily influenced my choice to buy it or not.

      this game can be buggy at times and while i only have a 980 gpu, i can run this game at medium settings and it still looks pretty decent. i did not play the early access, only full release, and i can say that there seems to be quite a bit of content to this game. this game is very multifaceted with social/town, farming, combat, mining, building, animal, and pet aspects, with that just being what i have discovered with 19 hours of playing. i play with 2 other people and the game runs fairly well. i have only encountered a few lag/server sync issues between other players, a few ui glitch errors, and 1 wonky combat fight with an elite. but beyond those few things i haven't seen much to stop me from wanting to play this game as much as possible. 


[h3] pros [/h3]
- lots of content (19 hours in and it feels like i have so much more to do)
- decent price (i was gifted the game but seeing the price for how fun this game is seems fair)
- fun with friends
- multiplayer actual works
- leveling up feels important and good
- missions feel good and not like leg work (you can visually see the work you put into the town)
- tons of townspeople
- combat feels good and fun
- character customization (you can super customize your character with sliders)
- gear (weapons and clothes have stats that can help you with gathering and fighting)
- weather (the weather events in this game are really great. so far i have seen rain, sandstorm, and summer 
   heat. i am waiting to see snow in this game as of yet.)
- server stays up (no matter who owns the town, i am able to play on my friends server even after the 
   person who made it has left. this is a big game changer for me seeing as you don't have to stop playing on 
   one server because the host has left or crashed.)

[h3] cons [/h3]

- desync/stutter issues (i have only had this happen 2-3 times playing so far and it is fixed by a simple return 
  to lobby and rejoin.)
- ui machine icons disappear (i have only seen this once and it was fixed by rejoining the lobby)
- forced personal chests (i mention this because it was a pain to have only so much room in the one 
   community chest you get at the start of the game. you can upgrade it, but i would like to have the option 
   to share my personal chest contents if i choose to. and not have to run back to home every time someone 
   needed something.
- combat (could use a little work on hit registration and how your character can go through the enemies 
   while swinging your weapon)
- accidental playable character requests (in the game there is an option to talk to real people and play a 
   mini-game called critters. it feels a bit annoying at times when you are trying to interact with machines or 
   doors and other playable characters get the input over the item/machine/door. could be quite annoying if 
   playing with a lot of people in one area but not too bad overall.)

overall this game feels pretty fun to play and in just 2 days my friends and i have put in almost 20 hours each.",15069
2023-11-09,"update: newest game update has significantly decreased my issues, i still experience some long loading screens, but the game is playable, and waiting 5-10 minutes the odd time is fine. thank you for this quick hot fix. 


unfortunately the game is unplayable solo, i can play bg3 on ultra settings. but solo sandrocks loading screens take 10-15 minutes (sometimes longer) per interaction, sleep, leaving/entering the home, or literally anything in the game, including talking to npc's. i have barley any issues on multiplayer, other then the fact some areas/missions are impossible due to certain things missing in multi(but its playable).

i waited for the release because i was such a fan of the first one and even played via xbox live pass.

currently i am surfing the web for fixes, from uninstalling, reinstalling, turning cloud off, turning every setting to low, switching graphics cards/cpu's. mind you i have no other processes running, and can play other games that require so much more usage. currently re-verifying the files, in hopes i can play the game solo when my partner is not on, and not ruin our multiplayer game. 

currently i consider this game to be completely early access still, and unplayable for most. i found online via reddit, many people having the same issue. 

developers i am sorry but until this is fixed, this review will remain the same, as your product is extremely expensive and at least should run the basics like being able to leave/enter my home, or sleep without it taking 15+ minutes each thing.
thank you ~",15069
2023-11-09,"the game is incredibly fun. i am more of an explorer guy, but i also enjoy farming and crafting, though the game does not really have much of that exploration or adventuring going on they really spoil you a lot with crafting and farming. socializing with the npcs is also fun and so much stuff and features with the npcs. i have never tried multiplayer, but it is a fantastic addition to playing with friends or families. honestly if i were to describe the game it would be a full-on essay, the game just has so much content, i would say it is a combination of animal crossing and stardew valley. i totally recommend it to people looking for casual and relaxing farm and craft game.",15069
2023-11-09,"i didn't play a lot of my time at portia but i picked this up anyway because i still liked it and i was curious what the developers were going to do with their next installment. i was not disappointed, i love this game and i like it way more than portia. the characters, story, and romance (the reverse confessions and reverse proposals are so sweet!) are well done, even the cheesy moments. i have to gush about the story for a moment, there were some things that i saw coming, but there were a few moments where i had to keep myself from yelling out loud because i just couldn't believe it! 

i really liked how they changed how you're able to build items, you don't need to have something in your hand in order to have it built. and when diving in ruins, the scanner highlights all of the possible relics instead of just one at a time. the map is huge, and even though its a desert, there is a lot to do especially with hunting monsters and collecting materials. 

if you played portia, whether if it was a little bit or a lot, you're going to like this game! and if this is your first time, i hope you give sandrock a chance because it's a gem of a game.",15069

janky and buggy, though. combat's bad and i got soft-locked in cutscenes a few times and had to relaunch the game. i still recommend it, just get friendly with the quick-save key if you play this.",15199
2023-11-08,this is crack,15199
2023-11-08,"i played portia, a while ago. i've had sandrock on my radar for a while. when i saw that they were intending to put multiplayer in, i thought to myself i can afford to wait until it's actually here. when it dropped, i had time and so did my usual co-op buddies and we jumped into it. one of my friends had played portia and the other had not. 

sandrock has had me gripped for a few days now, and i have only barely touched single player, spending almost all of my time in multiplayer. to those who have played portia, the multiplayer focuses on the gameplay and it delivers. it is very improved over what we had in portia. to those who are not familiar, who are just looking for a game to play with the people they play games with: do you enjoy games like stardew valley or minecraft, where everyone can kinda pick a 'job' and meet up at the house or base at the start and end of the day and spend the middle doing who knows what? if yes, you'll like sandrock. there are things like co-op bounties, co-op forms of the ruins where you hunt treasure, co-op dungeons, what seemed like a raid? (had its own tokens, was timed/scored) sure, after enough time, you're going to  max out your skill tree and start dipping into others, but the join/drop nature of the game (up to four people) means that there's ... often ... a lot to do. if you hit the ground with both feet running, there's tons of jobs to do. you can build yourself into a coma. you can go and make friends with townsfolk. you can try to get rich. 

the urban planning mechanic is well thought out and it works well. i'd maybe twist the ranching store to come online a little earlier (by the time i unlocked ranching it felt like i was so late in the tree that it only existed as a means to get yak hair) but it's fun. it's fun to build your workshop and build your house and build your skills and build your relationships. it's fun. there is no overarching story in multiplayer but you do iterate on the town through how you progress your commissions and by doing the urban planner. it's a good game for hangin' out with the guys. really.

as for the progression? it can be kinda hard, at times. not the combat, but figuring out where to get very specific tidbits you'll need. and the building commissions start to ramp up when you roam around the map. sometimes, you don't have the ability to get or refine the things you need for the commissions. i've constantly opened the wiki to guide me in the game, which is something i do for a lot of games, but i know some people are dead set against it.

also, relationships with npcs move slow. sometimes, i can't find the people i am looking for. there's a lot to learn how to do in this game because there's a lot to learn how to do. i still only know like four food recipes. there are sometimes minor bugs but i am guessing they'll get ironed out soon enough. nothing so serious as a crash or any lost progress. it's not a perfect game, but it's better than portia, which i already thought was good. and if you're into the genre, it's absolutely worth picking up.",15199
2023-11-08,"i'm so sane and normal about this game, it's true",15199
2023-11-08,this game is a lot of fun with friends or solo,15199
2023-11-08,"if you like the idea of collecting and hoarding mountains of junk and crafting it into a slew of various things then this game may be for you, post 1.0 the game feels very polished and smooth, a league above portia, well done devs (though the writing could certainly use some work)",15199
2023-11-08,probably one of the most fun games i've played in a year that's seen so many great titles. my buddy and i play this every night and there are so many interesting twists and turns. the npc's almost seem to have and pursue their own lives while constantly walking around and creating a lively atmosphere reminiscent of the sims. great job pathea games!,15199

the gameplay in the beginning can feel restricted and slow, and you have to rush to meet your daily goals. this does of course become easier and can be tweaked with game settings and mods if you want.

the story is overall lighthearted and often silly, but does have some underlying messages and darker tones.

between gathering resources, crafting, dungeons and many events, you can easily sink many hours into this game. i am currently 27 hours in and feel like i have barely started.",15199

2023-11-08,"man, i was so excited to play this game with my boyfriend until we discovered that the multiplayer is just an endless grind without any story. unfortunately this meant that the game is not what they led to believe it is and therefore not worth the money. we thought we would get a cozy stardew valley - kind of game with cute graphics and story, but there is no point in the multiplayer if it's just running around and grinding materials.",15199

what i think...

+ pros +
++++++++
+ beautiful visuals and characters
+ astounding game mechanics
+ tons and i do mean tons to do for hours on end
+ awesome crafting system
+ awesome building/upgrade system
+ easy to understand and play
+ challenging enemies
+ lots of quests and side missions
+ mail system that actually makes sense and lets you respond
+ town news that makes sense, you can subscribe to get updates on things happening in town
+ finally, a town that feels and looks legit, lots of stores, an arcade, and more
+ lots of mini games and events
+ lots of glorious cutscenes
+ feels very realistic in a lot of ways
+ gameplay draws you in a lot
+ lots of collectibles
+ lots of areas
+ singleplayer and multiplayer
+ lots of replay value


- cons -
----------
- multiplayer starts of with no house and a lot of missing buildings, this makes absolutely no sense
- controls in multiplayer are by default different than singleplayer, this too makes absolutely no sense
- player water tower to refill with water should have a visual meter to indicate water in it since it's extremely annoying just to have to open it up to check ever time and that makes it difficult to know if you're running low or not while busy with other town commisions and such. a simple visual meter on the side of the tank would make life so much better.
- a lot of the pop-ups such as hints/tips from quests and wandering around show up during cutscenes and can easily be missed as they don't stay there long so you might miss something important and thats very frustating


= verdict =

= my time at sandrock takes everything about the first game and makes it even better plus a little more! there is literally so much detail and realism packed into this wonderful stylized game to keep you busy with the game for hours on end and when you think it stops no it doesn't you can take things on again pretty much through continued multiplayer! its a wonderful game with so many great gameplay machanics and you'll never want to put it down! i highly recommend it! i really hope to see this game come to android as well like the first one did! i would buy it on mobile in a heartbeat! thanks devs for making this amazing game!

2023-11-08,"was an early supporter of this game because i loved my time at portia. sandrock is just as amazing as portia, i feel like portia and sandrock are the only games of its kind. panthea never fails, this one, just like portia was full of twist, full of love-able and hate-able characters. the bachelors are top tier, same with some of the bachelorettes. a lot is improved from portia, i feel like there's way more sentiments for the characters and i actually think this game felt longer then portia. it was really fun trying to stop the desertification, and its always fun to be able to fight against duvos, like the first game. if another game comes along in this series (pc/console game, i know there's a mobile, which ill probably play too). i will 100% buy, i know they teased as an april fools my time at duvos, which, since that's a city under a dictatorship and is the problem for most of the free cities, my god, would be amazing. i know they have a lot of towns they can work with, through both games and hopefully there's more to the story, more games in the future, because i am invested.",15199

2023-11-06,mi-en is such a whiny little bitch!,16388
2023-11-08,"this game deserves more attention! although my time at portia was a rough-edged gem that i still enjoyed quite a lot, sandrock greatly improves on its predecessor in almost every way. the town and characters are brimming with personality, the story is great, the quests feel meaningful, and overall the game just feels good to play. the quality-of-life improvements over the original are significant, especially regarding storage. combat still isn't perfect, though it's significantly better this time around. there is just so much to do in this game, and the loop is very addictive and fun!

if you never played portia, it's a bit hard to describe this game. it's not a ""farming game"", although you can do a bit of that. rather, you are a builder. you salvage, mine, gather, and refine materials, and use those to make and build whatever the town's inhabitants request. there is a heavy focus on characters, relationships, and story, in addition to the surprisingly interesting crafting system. the requests and commissions range from small items, to pieces of furniture, to useful structures that actually get placed permanently in the environment. you, your home (inside and out), and your yard are all highly customizable. almost everything you wear actually shows on your character, too, which is pretty neat!

the desert setting is more than just a backdrop, too. farming is a challenge. sandstorms are a threat. in order to keep your crafting machines running smoothly, you must keep them fueled, clean of sand, and cooled with water. collection and conservation of water is important in this game, not only as a theme, but also in practice. it should be tedious, but somehow it's not, i think due to just how well they implemented this ""you are living in a desert"" theme overall.

the only two negatives i can think of are a bit of lag as things load in when transitioning areas, and the often charmingly-awkward voice acting. neither of these are enough to even dampen my experience, though. i truly hope this is only the second in a long series of my time games!",15199
2023-11-08,"i only found out about this series about a week ago and holy cow, mtas is the next-gen 3d farm/life game i've always wanted since playing stardew valley. 

the npcs and characters have so much heart/quirk/personality and the game never takes itself too seriously with incredibly comedic and heartfelt quests, story, plot twists, and more. all the characters are so memorable and get fleshed out in incredible side quests that had my partner and i laughing out loud or audibly ""awww!""-ing.

building, sound design, graphics, combat, exploration, skill progression, pacing and more have made this game both incredibly addicting and relaxing, with some amazing quality-of-life changes over the typical farm/life/survival/etc sim games i haven't seen before.

10/10 and can't wait to 10x my current playtime.",15199

0/1, devs need to learn invisible walls are always bad design.  make interesting barriers or give an actual reason instead of invisible walls.

also, multiplayer feels like a completely different game than singleplayer.  there's not feature parity between the two, and many mechanics work differently for crafting and combat.

0/1, devs need to get feature consistency and parity between the two game modes.

movement is also very uncontrollable on keyboard and mouse.  my time at portia did movement better as your character had an infinitesimal turn radius, whereas in sandrock you will have a turn radius, which makes precision quite difficult.

0/1, devs need to revert the movement system to my time at portia.

the only thing this game has going so far is its multiplayer, because it's fun to strategize resource production.  however, my time at portia is the overall better game in very many respects.

overall:

0/1 for singleplayer; and
0/1-1/1 for multiplayer, if you have a group to play with.

if my time at portia had multiplayer (even a mod), this game would not be worthwhile.",15801

2023-11-07,"i played a bit in ea, but just started again after 1.0 release. this game is long, but i really am enjoying it. the dialog with some of the characters is so charming and funny to me. early game stamina is an issue like most games but with one problem, the food does little to nothing to help. other than that, i think this game is awesome. there is a lot of depth here in terms of intermingling with the characters, which adds an extra layer to your experience with them. i love the details, for example; my character changed her hair and the npcs noticed and commented on it. small stuff like this really adds to the simulation aspect of this game. i never seem to get bored or have nothing to do and when i do get those rare moments off, i actually enjoy just roaming around and talking to people or exploring. its definitely a worth while game if you like cozy simulation, rpg games. but word of warning to those that love farming... the farming plays a very minor role in the game in terms of progress, even though it is available. combat is more extensive than usual cozy games and animations for it are vivid. relationships (though i havent explored that much) are pretty involved, and building design is a bit tricky at first but offers lots of customisation. the game is just fun. it offers lots of small references to its predecessor, my time at portia (i didnt play it) which is cute for those players that did play that game. i would say it is definitely worth a playthrough if this is your type of game.",15801
2023-11-07,"even though i think this is a good game and after some optimizations it will be better. personally i just find this very tedious. as if the task of constantly grinding resources isn't time consuming enough, many of the games mechanics impose more restrictions so everything takes longer and forces you to stop what your doing. this isn't the only sandbox game that does that but i just wish the game would get out of my way and let me build and gather and do quests in the way i choose. the game though runs good and has many characters and a cool setting. i would recommend if you like stardew valley mixed with various features from other sandbox games",15801

2023-11-07,"there are few games i sit with such great anticipation, dropping everything else to play at launch. as a long time portia fan, i made the decision to wait for the full launch of sandrock so i could  really delve into the experience. it was well worth the wait!! 

mechanics that i loved in portia were only improved by sandrock, i applause the mining and archaeology process! i am glad it's so much easier to manage artifacts and the geodes of ore. i also enjoy the addition of the scrap yard contracts for those older ore types you don't always want to get digging for.

the combat addition of the gun is really funny and clever with the western vibe. although simple, the harder bosses do give a dark soul vibe with the roll dodging.

crafting has only gotten better, and i am glad certain quests don't ask for an egregious number of supplies like portia did some times. very reasonable and smooth to escalate types.

characters! wowie! this has gone leaps and bounds from portia (although i will always love them!) each character is so unique! love the full dialogue for romance options, the personalities of all npcs are a hoot! the writing has me laughing so often, you can feel the love with each cutscene no matter the minor character. i find myself actually wanting to befriend each npc in the city, they all have such great personality!

the story has been just as fun as portia, i love the world building of this series. my only complaint is wanting more!! need a prequel surrounding peach or something. the enemies, the subtle build of tension with hints through the newspapers and letters are a great touch. i find myself excited to open the mail!

my only cons so far are:
bugs - very minor though. this game is so much cleaner than portia at launch, a bit of hair bugs or clothing doesn't hurt nobody.
npc pathing - ai is always hard to manage, but lord trying to find some of these people before friend status is a nightmare! 
unfortunate timings - i have had a few funny situations regarding cutscenes, sandstorms and time management. maybe i'm just very efficient, but sometimes the mix and match of time sensitive missions can be a nightmare. shout out to the calendar feature!

all in all, this game is an amazing addition to my much beloved portia. the team knocked it out of the park and it's great to see what a budget can do. i am genuinely excited for any and all extra content they may throw our way, and i hope they celebrate such an awesome launch!",15801

the music is so fitting and atmospheric!  i absolutely played my time at portia to death and i loved the game, my time at sandrock is just so much bigger, more improved and more in depth and i love this one even more! 
worth every penny and the time i've waited for this game to be released.
",16388
2023-11-06,"very good game! the developers continued on their first idea (my time at portia) and vastly improved on it. there is no need to have played the previous game to enjoy this one. it got great characters, nice story, never a dull moment, crafting, grinding, farming, ranching, mining, sandfishing it got levels, relationship, events and you build stuff that are in the game world and not just on your land bit everywhere. i absolutely loved my time at portia and my time at sandrock is just amazing. can't leave the game alone. so looking forward to see what comes next!",16388
2023-11-06,"as you can probably tell from the playtime, i adore this game. coming in at the 200 hour mark (and possibly a few more) is no mean feat.

my time at sandrock took the formula pathea started in portia and dialed it up to the next level. the game plays roughly the same. you're a brand new builder that arrived at a town that is in decline and it is up to you to turn your talents to improve the lives of those around you.

the gameplay loop is fairly simple. go out into the wilds, gather resources, bring them back to your workshop and get your machines turning out the components necessary to fulfill your commissions, upgrade your capabilities and home, repeat. to do this, you manage stamina as you gather materials and also engage in light, fairly simple combat.

what pathea does well is package this up in a charming setting with an amazing cast of characters. the graphics engine, while simple, is supported by a unique art style that allows for a wide range of colorful residents of sandrock while keeping the system demand to a minimum. my 7800x3d and 7900xtx are utter overkill for this game. that said, don't let the relatively mild requirements fool you - the game is beautiful. the art style is timeless, the town has a unique feel and the landscape vistas are wonderful. i found myself taking in-game photos of things to take advantage of the customizable portrait decorations you can hang in your house and, later, factory.

the engine does have a few hitches. the draw distance is rather poor and there aren't intermediate level of detail models. objects will sort of pop into existence and if you have the lod bias set to anything less than maximum, you'll see the outline of a bubble immediately around you while the supports on your workshop's border fence pop into existence. it also struggles with longer game sessions, so if you play four hours at a time, you'll start to notice pathfinding breaking or weird artifacts like bushes floating up in space out in front of the temple of the light.

all in all though, i find the graphics and engine appealing. there are a few hitches and bugs here, though nothing experience breaking.

what really makes sandrock shine is the world pathea created. running in parallel with the events of portia, sandrock casts you as a builder that arrived in the town of the same name. the town is suffering from severe decline due to decades of resource mismanagement and environmental degradation. water is in short supply and routine sandstorms buffet the town, slowly chewing away what little life is left in the area. had it not been for a rich deposit of old world ruins, the town would have long since died and been left to vanish in the dunes of the euphala desert.

the town is populated with a rich cast of colorful characters with their own distinct personalities. my personal favorites are cooper, a local rancher who has a habit of speaking in lengthy diatribes and has a conspiracy theory streak (i swear cooper's voice actor had more lines than the next five characters combined), and unsuur, a well meaning but not too bright local deputy who loves rocks a bit too much who i liken to a combination of drax from guardians of the galaxy and barnie fife from the andy griffith show.

surprisingly, the plot is actually quite deep. there is more going on than a simple tale of you building up stuff. there is banditry, a conspiracy and more going on that has a surprising climax. sandrock not only has an interesting story, it goes well beyond what a charming life sim should be and fleshes out the broader world of the free cities alliance and the surrounding nations.

my time at sandrock is a solid combination of life sim and narrative experience combined with a light factory inventory management game. if you're looking for a nice change of pace, you can't go wrong here.",16388
2023-11-06,"wow, my time at sandrock is really an amazing game! after i got really disappointed by starfield and cities skylines: 2, i stumbled on my time at sandrock on youtube and also here on steam by some ads ... then i watched a few streams and bought it now!

it is such a nice game and i can't stop playing it! it's a mix of animal crossing and stardew valley and plays extremely well. it's not too childish and the ingame mechanics are very balanced. i am sure i can play this game for far beyond 100 hours! definitely worth the 30 bucks.",16388
2023-11-06,"amazing game, at first you would think nothing special, but i must say i played my time in partia and sandrock is a major improvement, if you dont know what this game is and you think on buying it definetly recomend, for new players the stamina system could be a bad thing, but give the game time, it sucks you in really fast. great story, great world, the game makes you feel like a real part of the town and when you notice how much you build in the world and how much it changes its really rewarding.",16388
2023-11-06,"a really nice relaxing farming game!!

single player may not be the most innovative story, but it is lovingly designed and fits the setting.
multiplayer works and the focus is on building the city, which is also a lot of fun.

i give it a clear purchase recommendation to anyone who likes cozy farming games like stardew valley, harvest moon and yes, animal crossing

so far there's only one point where i still have doubts and that is what is the replacement for the quest with the crane in order to be able to farm tin properly :d but i suspect that the error is more mine than the game :d but i'm open to any advice thankful :)

? ? ?

ein richtig schönes entspannendes farming spiel!! 
 
singleplayer ist vielleicht nicht die innovatievste story aber sie ist liebevoll gestaltet und passt zum setting.
multiplayer funktioniert und dort steht der stadtaufbau erstmal im vordergrund was auch sehr viel spaß macht.

von mir eine klare kaufempfehlung an jeden der auf cozy farming games steht wie stardew valley, harvest moon und ja auch animal crossing

bisher nur einen punkt an dem ich bis jetz noch verweifel und zwar was ist der ersatz für die quest mit dem kran um vernünftig tin farmen zu können :d aber da vermute ich den fehler mehr bei mir als beim spiel :d bin aber für jeden tip dankbar :)",16388

2023-11-06,"it should would be nice to be able to play enough of the game to actually give it a proper review but in my short play time i have had three freezes that required me to restart my entire pc.

one was hung on a black screen after a  cutscene and 2 were the audio distorting and slowing down leading up to freezes. the audio distortion followed by crashes was an issue they claimed to have fixed in the june 7th, 2022 patch notes, but several people complained they still had the issue and it was never mentioned by the devs again.

this is the second time pathea has released a game that i literally cannot play because of all the constant crashing even out of early access.",16388
2023-11-06,"unpopular opinion but i wasn't a fan of my time at portia and found it kind of overrated, so i was very surprised when my time at sandrock ended up being one of my favourite games of all time. i've played a lot of life sim style games and this is one of the best by far - it's the only one i've played to rival my love of rune factory 4 in terms of gameplay, story and character dialogue.

i have 110+ hours in the game (started a bit before the 1.0 release) and i'm not even finished the main story quests yet, i thought i was almost done a while back and it turned out i was only 2/3 of the way through. there are always meaningful story events happening and new characters being introduced to keep things interesting. 

there are a lot of activities to do each day to stop things getting too monotonous - a mix of exploration, dungeon crawling, mining or hanging around town. you can also fish and farm, which i'm not too fond of doing in this game but are totally optional outside of a couple of quests. 

the characters are where this game stands out - the localization team did a great job with the dialogue because it's full of personality and can be pretty hilarious at times. the town is very lively with the characters all having different relationships to each other and having a lot of joint quests and scenes so it feels like a real community. one downside is the day to day dialogue lines can get kind of repetitive but there are a lot of character related events which is where the bulk of the content is. their faces are also not that expressive in dialogue which would be my main complaint, but the voice acting is very expressive and fills that gap. 

there are some bugs at the moment but the devs seem very active and engaged with the community. aside from the bugs the game feels very polished, and i'm honestly blown away at the sheer scale of it for a relatively small company. there is so much content, from the very long main story, to the numerous character quests, to the new locations, mines and dungeons to unlock. and unlike portia each mine/ruin feels unique and has distinct level design features to keep things interesting. honestly huge props to the devs for what they've achieved here, you can tell a lot of love was put into the game and they genuinely had fun with the world and characters they created (speaking of the world, the worldbuilding is pretty in depth and the setting is very interesting - i did love the concept of my time at portia despite my criticisms of the game, and that interesting history continues to be explored here).",16388
2023-11-06,:),16388
2023-11-06,"let me preface this by saying that i played my time at portia and didn't enjoy it at all. my time at sandrock absolutely blows it out of the water, and addresses my two most standout grievances about the first.

this time, they have designed the map properly so that your character never spends too long traversing from one location to another. the town map/level is beautifully made so that your workshop is never too far from any npcs you might need to reach/chat with daily. secondly, this is the most fun i've had with a towns' npc population in a while. a lot of cozy game developers forget to develop their characters beyond the basic, typical strokes. at first i felt like this would be the case for sandrock too, but i found myself genuinely enjoying a lot of the town's npc personalities that shine through their questlines. the writing isn't nearly the best i've seen in a game, but it's definitely a step above most cozy games i've played recently. at least more fun, if anything!

if i had to pick at any obvious downsides, i'd say that some voice actors are clearly uncomfortable in their characters' accents and inflections and it shows. i don't mind it too much but it might be grating to some.

as of the time of writing, i'm 40 hours in and i'm still being engaged with the game, so it earns my seal of approval.",16388

2023-11-05,"nice game, would be better if the dev console wasn't rendered inaccessible upon full launch. don't get me wrong, pathea makes grinding fun more than a chore, but when your whole game revolves around grinding, god, you've got to let people choose to use console commands. i completely would get if the devs locked the console only for multiplayer, but why a total hard lock. once i complete the story and missions, sandrock will feel like a massive chore if i have to continue grinding just to do the things i actually want to be doing. 

tldr: sandrock now feels like a sandbox game without the sandbox mode. like playing in a sandbox without sand or attempting to swim in a pool without water. i can't recommend sandrock once more unless dev console is returned.


aside from that discrepancy, have some bullet points.

positive:

1.) very pretty game world, the town of sandrock and her people feel rich and enticing. although, diversity is what makes the world appealing, but that mostly ends if you stray any significant distance away from town or your workshop.

2.)romance feature in sandrock gets more ""worth it"" points compared to portia. i romanced unsuur, and his character arc was adorable and had me go from finding him irrelevant to him seeming like a wholesome, goofy character who i can strongly relate to. i cry when i see him in a sad or embarrassing sitch.

3.) house building. coming from a lifelong sims fanatic, sandrock's home building feature draws me in despite it having a sort of learning curve. i'm very dependent on mouse/keyboard when in building games, so its of note that sandrock's house builder catches my attention at all.

negative:

1.) despite its pastel-toned cartoonish vibe, sandrock can feel too immersive. grinding never gets genuinely less dreadful. machines require both water and fuel to operate, adding an extra thing to worry about despite adding nothing of value to the game. requiring fuel makes sense in a game like this, it serves as a subtle tactic to get the player to be actively involved in their workshop. requiring water as well looks good in terms of world design, but serves no purpose otherwise that fuel requirement wasn't already achieving.

2.) sandrock feels like a rich, vibrant world. sandrock also feels just as empty as it does to visit earth in starfield.  aside from story purposes, i felt no eagerness to explore new map areas. i rarely leave the confines of my workshop or the town itself. when i bought sandrock, the idea of it taking place in a desert allured me, it rendered in me that eager feeling to see what's out there. but after seeing what's ""out there"", i'm left feeling dissapointed that there wasn't more. no personality or variation in new map spaces. generally, ""all's the same"".",19735
2023-11-05,"if you liked mtap, this is more of the same, but better polished and more fun moment to moment. very good, verging on great.

some minor annoyances. pace of ramp-up can be egregiously slow in the early game. tutorials are kind of intrusive. some of the prominent voice actors are, how to put it, like a pickhammer to the side of the skull.

we gonna finish this game for real. this co-op update is beyond my expectations, gameplay become super fun, and so many things to do. and the better is it have server to progress multiplayer without one of us be host. thankyou pathea!",19735
2023-11-05,"before you buy:

early into the game you get flirty letters from a homosexual man. you catch him once you figure out he's been putting them in your mailbox. you're quested to go and convince him to come out of the closet. i'm grateful i was distracted from the enjoyment of the video game to be reminded that gay people exist and have feelings too.

2023-11-05,"mixed review while i do enjoy it has the same problems i had with portia. the pacing is really slow and the map tho big it feels extremely empty, there’s a lot of walking back and forth with nothing around, easy fix would be to make the town buildings smaller and closer together. there’s no need for the amount of space and scale, it is a town in the middle of nowhere with limited water after all.",19735

2023-11-05,"the first sequel in years to not disappoint me.

better than portia in every way, and i'm having a lot of fun.
- much higher production quality, as is apparent from cutscenes, voice acting, artwork, character designs, quests, writing, etc.
- many much appreciated qol improvements, such as being able to pet multiple farm animals at once.
- combat has been markedly improved (thank god), but still nothing to write home about.
- production loop has been vastly improved. no longer will your machines run 24/7 producing bronze plates. commissions and constructions ask for varied items in reasonably quantities.
- home customization has been introduced, letting you create whatever size and layout you like.

critiques:
- character customization is very basic, unfortunately.
- fishing! fish variety has been vastly trimmed down, and you're no longer incentivized to catch one of every fish; the fish tank is gone.
- many tooltips are holdovers from beta and therefore now inaccurate.
- 60 hours in and i have had 2 bugs that forced me to restart the client.
- inconsistencies in certain cutscenes.
- distinct lack of diversity in romanceable women. for men there's skinny dudes, chunky dudes, big dudes, older dudes, fem dudes, but for women there's only skinny young lady. some big girls or older ladies would have been nice.",19735
2023-11-05,"decent game, but not ready for full release. i would recommend it once the issues are fixed.
two most annoying issues:
1. loading performance is terrible - loading a save or entering ruins takes minutes!
2. machines become dusted, but no actual dust is visible and there's no way to clean them - it's a known issue, and still has not been fixed (there's a workaround, but that's not good enough - fix your game!)",19735
2023-11-05,"i absolutely love this game. previously my favourite farming game was portia, now it's sandrock. it's such an amazing game that its existence makes me happy.
let me explain: i play a lot of farming games and i love the genre. many of them share a number of common flaws however, such as shallow characters, weak non-farming mechanics, quest design that feels like chore. not in sandrock (or portia, for that matter)! the characters interact with each other in believable and lively ways. it's no longer that the player is the only thing that exists to them. everyone comes together to build a town and the player is only one small part of it. this makes the quests so much more believable.
what really impressed me was the way it differs from/improves upon portia. portia did a lot of things very well, but sandrock didn't just take those mechanics unchanged. instead, sandrock improved upon every little thing in portia that bothered me (e.g. the guns were a bit weak in portia; they're totally viable in sandrock) and also refreshed other aspects (e.g. i liked the fishing mini game in portia; sandrock changed the mini game but it's equally entertaining) so that series fans like me aren't bored.
the way the multiplayer is implemented is also quite good.
overall, i just love the thought and care the devs have put in this game. it's incredibly rare nowadays to see a game in a popular genre where the devs didn't settle for easy formulas and past success, but continue to improve. love everything about this game!",19735
2023-11-05,"this game is very cute and well made! it looks beautiful, has great building mechanics, farming/raising livestock, and fighting monsters! the npcs are all really well-made with distinct personalities. the variety in people in town/that you can romance is great! the clothing/accessories on your character look nice and have good movement physics. overall, the game is a solid 8/10 for me right now! and that's at 13 hours in. i'm sure i'll grow to love the game more as i play even more.",19735
2023-11-05,"this game is simply amazing. i spent over 130 hours just in the early access. i've now restarted and i still don't feel that the gameplay is boring or grindy. the mechanics are user friendly. my time at portia is an awesome game. my time at sandrock takes all of the unique mechanics of that game and gives huge quality of life updates. if you enjoy life sims, this is not a game you should pass up. the world feels so real and interactive. if you like gathering, dungeon diving, fulfilling requests and building relationships with npc's it's all here. this game has a little bit for everyone and can be played however you like to play. definitely one of my top 5 all time favorite games.",19735
2023-11-05,"long time portia player here. i bought my time at sandrock very early in development and then shelved it until the 1.0 release. i must say that it was worth the wait. you have delievered an awesome product here, there is so much improvement in the overall quality and the depth of gameplay compared to my time at portia. this is a worthy next part in the my time series. thank you for your hard work, you can be proud of the result!",19735
2023-11-05,"i love this game, its chill, its non-punishing, its stress free, its just a really charming and sweet game. i liked portia as well, but never spent nearly the amount of hours i did in this game. i still haven't even finished the story. 

the devs really did a wonderful job improving upon the previous game's mechanics, making a lot of qol improvements that just make the game that much more relaxing and enjoyable. the art is clean and adorable, and the characters are very well done, just like they were in the previous game. i can't stop myself from coming back to these lovable idiots, and i mean that in the most endearing way possible. :d

if you like life sim games, this game has a bit of everything, some farming mechanics, a very basic fishing system that's not your traditional fishing minigame, but its easy and doesn't feel burdensome or required. i love the transmog system the devs have added to allow outfit customization of the character, so you don't have to worry about stats over looks. 

well done, pathea games, well done! thanks for giving us a fun escape from the troubles of life with such a charming and beautiful world.",19735

2023-11-05,"have you ever tried getting into stardew valley and thought to yourself ""this game is fun but i wish it were 3d?"" well, i would have to say my time at sandrock is just that game. not only is it a huge improvement over my time at portia, but its probably the ultimate ""chill out"" game. great for enjoying a game and retaining positive vibes throughout the playthrough. i'm still pretty early in but i can see myself playing this often after a long day.

i don't normally play these type of games (i'm more into action and strategy) but this game does a great job retaining my attention and keeping me positive. great job to the devs! highly recommended.",19735

2023-11-05,very addicting,19735
2023-11-05,"i picked up my time at sandrock as soon as it was available in early access. i enjoyed my time at portia and was excited to jump into this and be along for the development ride. if you enjoyed portia and haven't picked this up yet, i'd highly suggest you do so, you won't be disappointed.

i'm not much of a reviewer so he's my highlights.

good

-the visuals-the visual presentation is great. the style they started with in portia was kept for sandrock and tightened, cleaned, and it really pops. a straight improvement from its predecessor.

-characters-the characters fit with the world that these games take place in. goofballs on the one hand but can be serious on the other. it does a good job of portraying a tight knit group that has history with each other and rely on each other. the vas do a good job and you never really feel like its being phoned in.

-story-so, you've played some harvest moon games, stardew valley, and similar games...whelp, you know what kind of story you're getting into. that's not a bad thing though, we love those stories and that's why we scoop games like these up because while every story in these style of games has a similar foundation what's built on top of it gives us an insight into the biggest character in these games, the town. the town is a character all its own, a combination of its past, present, environment, and the characters living in, around, or otherwise interacting with it throughout the story. it takes on a life of its own and sandrock, as a town/character, is fun to see develop.

-qol-there were so many improvements to make life much easier in sandrock, it would almost make portia a little harder to go back to. but i very much appreciate everything they implemented in sandrock to make a builders life easier when it comes to making your shop hum along and get those contracts done. something a portia player can appreciate more than a newbie but a thumbs up from me.

bad

let me preface this by saying i'm not a tech savvy man, what you know about the power of rigs and all of the bells and whistles is probably beyond me so take this short section of bad with a grain of salt, your results may vary.

when i'd start up the game, while my load times were rather quick when i'd get into the game it could take a solid minute, at max, for the world to load everything. if i got into the game and i was loading in while in the house, that was fine but once i left the house or would load into a game that had me outside there could be a bit of a wait for things to load. i never found it a terrible thing but a rig that's a little on the lower end might have more of an issue.

the other thing i noticed is that if i played for a block of 3-4 hours in a row i could start to experience slowdown that became much more significant as the time would go on and control inputs would also be laggy. a couple times character path-finding became erratic and would be my prompt to log off. i haven't done blocks like that in a while and so i don't know if it's a concern and it may have just been my machine but i did experience that.",19735
2023-11-05,what a cute game,19735
2023-11-05,"man this game is addicting. the gameplay, the balance, the bodies, i just want pen to rawdog me",19735
2023-11-05,"as of right now, the game has some major issues. it seems to run just fine, but the problem it has is loading everything in. moving to a new area takes sometimes up to 30 seconds for the loading screen. then when the new area finally loads in, it needs to load the objects in the environment, your items, and even the ui. just trying to open the pause menu so i can save has sometimes taken 20 minutes to load (and even then, i still have to wait even longer for the buttons in the menu to start working).

i enjoyed the first game well enough, so i imagine that this one will be good as well once they figure out how to improve these issues. until then, the frustration outweighs the fun in its current state.",19735
2023-11-05,yes,19735
2023-11-05,amazing game!! such a huge improvement from my time in portia even though it was already a great game.,19735
2023-11-05,"as an early and full access player and lover of portia, i waited to play sandrock until it came out (a few days ago lol), and so far, i'm absolutely thrilled with it! its obvious the developers listened to player feedback, as the quality of life changes/additions to sandrock is fantastic. on equal level as portia, the characters are unique and charming, the art is adorable, and its the perfect balance of familiarity and freshness. i absolutely recommend playing portia and sandrock, and i'm so excited to see what the story has in store!",19735
2023-11-05,it's good. worth your time for sure.,19735
2023-11-05,"as massive fan of portia, bought this one first day of ea and played it from time to time at various states of it's beta.
at ea launch game had terrible loading time and optimisation issues and since then devs went miles to improve it, up to the point it works smoothly like portia while being massively above it terms of graphics and stuff.

compared with mtap the game feels better in every possible direction, devs listened to their playerbase and adapted the game as much as possible and so far it's one of the best ""life sim"" games on market, easily equal to legendary stardew valley itself.

if you liked the first game - rest assured, it's ""the same but better"". much better.
so better that paying full price feels not enough assuming the amount of effort and love devs put into this game.
heavily recommending to any fan of the genre. good stuff.",19735

2023-11-04,this is a masterpiece <3 <3 <3 <3,16806
2023-11-04,"bought in early access, trusting that eventually the devs would create something worthwhile. around comes 1.0 and i cannot even play the game due to crashes in the opening cinematic. disgusting.",16806
2023-11-05,"i purchased the game a few days before the official release, from an online recommendation, and i can honesty say that this is the best farm sim i've ever played. it improves on so many quality of life issues that i've experienced with other farming sims. being able to alter how quickly the time of day passes by and also having villagers that actually have depth to their characterization, voice acting and updated dialog that matches the game's story progression, it's a breath of fresh air. i love that villagers actually react to weather conditions, change their form of dress to suit the weather, and don't just stand outside like robots as if it were a regular sunny day. love the freedom and flexibility provided by designing your character's house and farmland. i also love the diversity in the cast of characters, they don't all look like they have the exact same cookie cutter anime body shape. 

also, being able to talk to npcs while still mounted on your horse, was a feature i was relived to see in this game. i cannot tell you how annoying it was playing games like harvest moon and having to get off your mount just to talk to someone, then jump back on your mount every single time. being able to access all storage boxes from a single storage unit, being able to complete fetch quest assignments with items that you're not carrying with you at the time, but are still in your storge inventory is also a wonderful addition. the animals in the game, whether they be farm animals or wild animals that you fight for exp have their own unique charm to them. love the fact that you can upgrade your horse and take photos with it. and the horse gallop and leaping animations are wonderful. 

i currently play this game on the steam deck and it's been a great experience. camera felt a little wonky at first, had to set the x and y camera sensitivity to 15 and the aim sensitivity to 40 for it to feel better on steam deck, so not sure if the defaults camera setting was set up for keyboard. other than a few floating foliage plants in the air, and utensils not appearing in an npc's hand while eating, the game has ran near prefectly on my steam deck. 

cannot wait for any future dlc planned by this dev. would love to see possibly mounted combat, or updated pets, enemy monsters, townsfolk, or farm animals. or having a game in the future where you can choose to be an antagonist or protagonist would be a welcome to see. my only complaint would be during character customization, i wish the character could have more body shape options then just looking like a stick. when you're a woman, it's a little frustrating not being able to give your character a figure or hips. but other than that, i have no other complaints about the game. i truly hope other developers can see the success of this franchise and use it as an example to improve theirs as well. like iron sharpening iron.",19735
2023-11-04,"as a player that played my time at portia before , sandrock really do improve in terms of content and quality of life . for new players that had not touch portia before , sandrock might be overwhelming for the amount of things it threw at you first . however once u get used to it , thats where the fun in sandrock starts .though , most of us probably would be cursing whenever a certain weather arrives especially if we had things we wanna do on that day ...ahh my items got blown away!!! come backkkkk!!!!!",16806

2023-11-04,"this game has been honestly really enjoyable overall. i played it on the early access at first and then put the game down until release and i'm impressed by the amount of content it has now compared to when i first tried it out. i really enjoy all the building, crafting, gathering etc. 

the game makes me feel like i'm always in a race against time, on the clock tick tock gotta go fast, but after a while i realized it really dsnt matter if you just chill out and take your time. missing some of the daily missions is perfectly fine and just exploring at your own pace is not a problem at all. of course, the nature of the daily cycle mixed with the daily contracts adds this feeling of being in a rush to do everything you can do within a single day. 

the combat and gearing is very simple but its still a part of the game i did enjoy. don't expect like difficult combat, but its still satisfying to see my damage grow as i get levels and upgrade my gear to purple + highest item level in the machines.

i hit max character level and max level workshop in multiplayer and i still have places to explore, missions to complete and new things to craft/build.",16806

very engaging story and event plus with fully voice acted character too.most life don't even have voice acted character.this game show to passion developer to create great life simulation game.this game is improvement from portia in every way possible.

negative:
outside story nothing much to do at endgame since pretty much max the commission already
no more interaction between characters and player when you max out and do all their quest (beside they asking to date\play)
character like ernest / amirah /owen have almost no interaction at all with player

2023-11-04,"if you're looking for a beautiful game to relax, my time at sandrock is definitely worth checking out. even if you're not usually a fan of this genre, this game has a charm that will draw you in. it's clear that the devs put extra love into this game, just as they did with the beloved portia. overall, i highly recommend giving my time at sandrock a try.",16806
2023-11-04,"great improvements compared to portia. 
tips to get started: 
get wood scraps whenever you see them (chests!), 
get some water improvements from tech tree, 
everyday eat twice at the saloon (start with discounted meals).",16806

2023-11-03,a great game,11835
2023-11-03,"sandrock is an awesome game! it has become my alltime favorite.  i also enjoyed portia but sandrock is so much better.  storyline and characters are fun and i love the building aspect to the game.  win/win!!

keep more games like this on coming please!",11835
2023-11-04,"came into sandrock as a big my time at portia aficionado and as many have said, fans of the latter will find a lot to love in this title.

mtas has brought [i] huge [/i] improvements in the quality-of-life department, along with gorgeous visuals and a new multiplayer mode to boot. recent updates have really fleshed out npc stories and brought the depth of character i loved in mtap, and it's been wonderful to watch this game come to life over the course of its early access period.

for newcomers: the ""my time"" series stands out to me as a life sim that has it all, from crafting and farming to romance and combat, with robust systems that make it all enjoyable to play - and my time at sandrock is no different. 

i'm creeping up on 500 in-game hours... if that says anything!",16806
2023-11-04,"basically portia in the desert.  it looks better and there's a lot more polish, and more importantly there's a number of qol improvements.  things like the game automatically taking things from your storage containers, sprint toggle, fast travel points being there from the start, etc.  the perk tree is also far more useful this time around.  the characters seem a little more interesting this time as well.  i still like the core gameplay concept more than most farming sims, as your money comes from doing commissions rather than just mass producing whatever is valuable and throwing it into a box.

that said there's still some issues from the first game, the biggest being the mobile game timers on all the crafting.  i sure do enjoy having to wait 10+ minutes of real life time to smelt some bars, and then another 5-10 minutes to turn those into whatever other parts your need.  you just kind of have to make 4-5 of each production machine, but then of course that means more resource gathering to fuel them.  just like the first game, a mod to make crafting faster would cut the game length in half.  the combat also hasn't improved at all.  you still just mash attack and do a dodge roll every so often, and that's it.  there's an armour break system now, but it gets trivialised once you find the '+1 break' skill on the perk tree and murder everything in seconds.

if you need a busywork sim game to fill your time, this is still a decent improvement on the first one.  there's lots and lots of stuff to do, it's a chill game genre,  and it's entertaining enough to overlook most of the flaws.",16806
2023-11-03,"really good, i like the silly monsters",11835
2023-11-03,it's good game,11835
2023-11-03,"i played my time in portia and couldn't get into it. but after some rave reviews, i decided to give this one a chance and boy am i glad i did! my time at sandrock is more approachable than my time at portia and i am really enjoying it! the graphics, combat, crafting, mining and gathering are all very enjoyable! this is like stardew valley but way less farming and more building. i highly recommend it!",11835
2023-11-03,,11835
2023-11-03,"actually so far its been fun, combat feels fun, it seems like it will have quite the grind to it but all and all ive had nothing but fun yet",11835
2023-11-03,"really good game, unfortunately it runs like garbage, now you're out of early access, are you going to optimize it or not?",11835
2023-11-03,fun,11835
2023-11-03,"very fun so far. my time at portia was good, but with this game they've really improved on all aspects of game development. i am excited to see more.",11835
2023-11-03,i truly love this game and starting over after 400 hours in early release. i am still giddy with excitement . thank you!!!,11835
2023-11-03,"engaging story line and fun gameplay! the graphics are big upgrade from my time at portia. if you are a fan of farming sims and have played stardew valley and coral island, then you will love this game. many hours of fun and the combat is also a big upgrade.",11835
2023-11-03,"fun game, better than my time at portia in every way",11835
2023-11-03,this game is well done and very addicting especially once you find your rhythm of crafting and gathering. probably the best feature of the game is how they handle inventory and storage. you can craft at any worktable/machine from items that are in any chests and you can turn in quests anywhere on the map with items that are in your chests at home. you can also push a button to store and sort items from your inventory into matching items that are in any of your chests. this is the best qol feature of the game imo since inventory management in other games is a pain so i'm glad sandrock is doing it right.,11835
2023-11-03,"my time at optimizing is a cutesy, cozy, post apocalyptic life sim.

enjoy characters that make you think you might be a bully on the inside and dialouge written by 2 guys that went to the same comedy course together. voice acted characters that will make you feel like the only real person in a universe full of robots are here too to spruce up your free time and welcome you to your shack far outside of city bounds because no way in hell are they sharing space with your filthy ass.

there are many things to do! spend your time recycling wood, recycling stone, recycling metal and even recycling rubber. ask other inhabitants of sandrock to join you in any of the over 1 activities on offer. become a neet strategist as you attempt to figure out how half the seasonal event work. give up and recycle wood again! exciting!!!

now if you'll excuse me i have to pay out of pocket for a new water tower less we all die of dehydration within the next week and the church zealots that rule this town do not hand out credit even for life threatening disasters that affect all of us. don't you dare ever ask for anything for any goverment contracts.

enjoy. 8/10 (i really do like it. i'm dating the divorced single mom it makes up for everything.)",11835
2023-11-03,so far the overall game is great. just as you start to get bored doing basically the same thing over and over there's something new that happens. bringing you back into the game. i do wish there were more choice and romance interactions (times that the hearts come up in conversations). but other than that it's a great game. it's right up there with stardew valley for me so thank you.,11835
2023-11-03,played the 1st game loved it so tried this out definitely a upgrade. the world changes more compared to the 1st game. loved it. good game.,11835

2023-11-03,"my time at portia never really clicked with me (i played it for 100+ hours, still enjoyed it). my time at sandrock has that special touch to it! immediately was hooked by this game, and excited to play it for many many hours :) 

if you liked my time at portia at all, you'll love this.",11835
2023-11-03,"okay, but how does the oasis stay clean during and after a sandstorm?????????
the church has learned barrier magic, obviously.",11835
2023-11-03,"good game, was already really polished with minimal bugs during early access. just missing story and content that was added at full release today.

big improvements from portia if you've played the previous game from pathea, good quality of life changes, better graphics, more story, content and lore.",11835
2023-11-03,"my time at sandrock have been a captivating and immersive gaming experience. from the moment i set foot in this post-apocalyptic world, i was drawn into its rich narrative, extensive crafting system, and the challenges it presented.

the landscape of sandrock is a visual treat, with its desolate beauty and a sense of exploration that kept me engaged for hours on end. the attention to detail in the environment and the variety of biomes made every journey exciting, whether i was traversing the  wastelands or navigating the mysterious ruins.

the crafting system is where sandrock truly shines. with a wide array of resources to gather and a plethora of blueprints to discover, i was constantly motivated to experiment and create new items, from weapons and tools to cozy furnishings for my humble abode. the feeling of progress as i upgraded my workshop and expanded my capabilities was incredibly rewarding.

the interactions with the colorful cast of characters in sandrock added depth to the story and provided a sense of community in an otherwise harsh world. building relationships with the townsfolk was an enjoyable aspect of the game, and their unique personalities and quests brought the game world to life.

while my time at sandrock was largely enjoyable, there were occasional technical hiccups and performance issues that could be frustrating. however, the frequent updates from the developers gave me hope that these issues would be resolved over time.

in conclusion, my 150 hours at sandrock have been a delightful adventure. the combination of exploration, crafting, and storytelling in this unique post-apocalyptic world made it a memorable gaming experience, and i look forward to further updates and improvements as i continue to explore and build in this engaging sandbox world.",11835

2023-11-03,"i have loved this game series from the start. it is a great change from the farming sims that are going around, but it has the relaxed game play that puts it in that category. you can go at your own paces and the characters are just as much fun to focus on as the story line. the updates from the first game show that the series is only going to get better as it goes. keep up the great work developers!",11835
2023-11-03,love it. lots of improvements from portia.,11835
2023-11-03,"ok, so just bought today, played for just over 2hrs, no problems at all, really enjoying it. i come back to the game and there's a patch, no worries, new content is always great. unfortunately, the game launches i go into the world and it immediately crashes. it might be my save game so i start a new one, and i finish character creation, go into the game and it crashes. so as it stands i cannot now play the game at all. does anyone check the patches before they are pushed live?!?",11835

2023-11-03,"my time at portia was already a great game with a lot of interesting and fun ideas, but this new game, just got most of the (many) clunky bits from the original title, applied a shiny new coat of beautiful paint over them, fixed most of the issues, added a ton of qol improvements and focused on being a fleshed fun experience with hours upon hours of content. and even then, they also managed to slap multiplayer and coop mode, too!

for the price, this is truly a gem that will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours. this is now the equivalent of stardew valley on 3d, with its own ideas and style.

just a fun, campy and wholesome experience that delivers what it promises.

if you liked portia, or any other similar game, you will surely enjoy your time in sandrock!

more games like this, please!",11835
2023-11-03,so far so good,11835
2023-11-03,"so good so far. could use a graphic overhaul but honestly, its been so good so far. my only problem at the beginning with getting the deluxe ed was i had no room to put anything! i had to make so many chests. i'm not mad about it, but it definitely delayed a true start xd if you like farming sims with a lot of oomf, my time at sandrock is the play",11835
2023-11-03,"great game with amazing concepts. different from your average building game. there's tons to do and explore. just when you think that you are all caught up, you go to the next day and there's even more. the progression is fantastic, and you always feel like everything you do is meaningful. highly recommend.",11835
2023-11-03,"great cozy game, plenty to do, plays well, progression feels good, voice acted, just a well made product! loved my time at portia, definitely feeling the same about this.",11835
2023-11-03,"this game is something else. so comfy and relaxing to play, but delivers great story, which often isn't a thing for this type of relaxing games. plot twists are very well written and genuinely surprising, i really envy people who are going to experience them for the first time. romance stuff is, in most part, also very good. there are some shortcoming with few of the characters, but i believe it can be improved and more content can be added.
overall, i played it for 750 hours and i can't wait to play for twice, thrice and even more",11835
2023-11-03,"they took everything about portia and turned it up to 11.

a wide variety of people in town. so many personalities. they play off of each other to make it feel like it's a real interaction. there are disagreements where both sides aren't wrong. there are little things that drive the characters forward. intrigue. a history!

yes, i'm a bit biased. i've been playing the early access game for a long time. watching this grow from a concept to an actual fully fleshed out game has been a lot of fun. playing it is even more so. :)",11835

2023-11-03,"imagine a kickstarted, crowdfunded ea-game that promised full online co-op campaign via description, steam-tags and all sorts of initial suggerence only to knowingly double-down after the fact with the main excuse of ""oh mp kinda hard/difficult and we 'forgot' to technically design/implement around mp as a foundation of the game... but thx for your money! kthxbye :) o/""

do not buy this game if you expect full co-op story campaign from it's ""online co-op"" in steam tags. i'd also strongly recommend against buying this game if you oppose to false advertising and intentional/malevolent business practices.

you can't seriously expect anyone to believe gamedevs/publishers who clearly are able to create and publish a full-fledged aaa-game... to having ""misunderstood"" or ""forgotten"" the technical and meta-linguistic requirements and meaning of full... online... co-op, multiplayer campaign.

buy the game after the fact/release if you're a gullible clown that enjoys being scammed, and sitting in some moronic, watered-down ""mp co-op mode"" that mainly stands as a testament for devs+publisher to have an ""excuse"" or marginal ""validity"" for their initial false advertisement and to keep their lovely, little ""online co-op"" tag on steam.

another excuse they came up with were ""linguistic"" or ""cultural"" difficulties and ""misunderstandings"". like who are you going to fool. it's not that ""full mp co-op story campaign"" is a completely new genre or ""term"". not much to see here: just a bunch 'o negative, scumming business-clowns that cannot experience love or empathy.",11835

2023-11-03,"the my time game series is surely improving throughout the games that they've released. portia was amazingly beautiful but sandrock gave an incredible gameplay experience. first off, the npcs are gorgeous physically and personality wise. the story line is incredible, i mean i've been expecting duvos invasion but not like what i've experience in sandrock. the plot twist was quite unpredictable because i've been eyeing 1 character and it turned out that he/she was just a puppet lol and the mastermind is a different npc all along. and logan ughh, logan. i don't think i need to elaborate that further. i am hoping for an expansion pass since there are certain areas of the map that are present but not currently explorable. 

p.s. automatically bought your dlc because the new pet is cute and the new outfit is cute as well. i hope you can add npc outfit dlcs just like in portia coz i'd like to see logan in a different perspective *wink wink.",11835

2023-11-03,the game so i enjoyed i would recommended for others and the only con is the dlc be separated to purchase and have the gecko as an actual pet,11835
2023-11-03,"185 hours. this was the total hours i played on this game while it was still on early access and now that my time at sandrock is officially released this will easily double. i play a ton of farming/building/life sims but never quite as much as i have for this one (barring animal crossing which i feel is in a sub genre of it's own when it comes to sim games because of its real life time shenanigans).

the gameplay loop is addictive and will definitely give you that ""just one more day"" feeling in games like this one. if you ever played my time at portia (which i also have over 100 hours on) then let me just say that this one is better in every single aspect. the environment is much different than the storybook style that portia has. you live in a harsh dessert and very much feels like starved for important resources like water (water is very important in this game) but i feel like seeing it transform with your help as the new ""builder"" makes it feel all the more rewarding. 

the npcs feel very engaging and alive and react based on interactions you have with them (i had one npc propose to start dating that i had to turn down and even though they seem to have taken the rejection well, you can still feel the heartbreak in the rejection with the ensuing dialogue you get from them when you try to talk to them again the following days). and yes! reverse proposals are a thing!

the storyline is probably one of the best ones i have seen in all the games i played in this genre. it pushes you to keep getting the resources and fulfilling the requests as soon as you can to see what happens next.

now though there is a bit of farming, the main focus of the game is more on building the town and creating the things needed for said town building. from stage displays, mining lifts, ""bus stops"" to even having to plant flowers and crafting benches to beautify the town-these are responsibilities that fall on you as the builder.

there are so many other great things to be said about my time at sandrock but i will say as someone who has stardew valley near and dear to my heart (i have 100% that game on my switch like twice already), that this is probably the only game so far that can rival the kind of enjoyment and satisfaction that stardew gives. honestly, even more so.",11835
2023-11-03,"my time at sandrock is a life simulator game about being an combat engineer-farmer in a post-apocalyptic arid desert setting where water is a scarcity. if you've played the previous game in the series, my time at sandrock is superior in every single way except perhaps the price tag and in the rare category of ""games with quality and originality from a chinese developer"".

unlike the previous game in the series, the game has little focus on time limits and is generally a laid-back experience focused a little more on storytelling than on repetitive routine actions. you build devices, conduct repairs, decorate your home, ingratiate yourself to other townsfolk - it's tempting to compare it to stardew valley, however i find this somewhat inaccurate because stardew valley has little in the way of interesting writing, characterisation, nor a plotline to keep me engaged in it as it relies heavily on a modding community for such content.

this writing and characterisation successfully caters to both children and adults - characters aren't particularly complex in personality, however, the dialogue has an abundance of dry wit, sarcasm and humour to lampoon the moral lessons it's trying to impart; this cushions the irritation that adults may experience when being preached to about what they would consider as obvious lessons in responsibility such as ""don't waste water"", ""don't monopolise resources"", ""don't behave like a psychopath"".

nowhere is this more apparent than in quests where saturday-morning-cartoon npcs blithely remark on and lampshade their anti-social behaviour before you deal with them in a series of increasingly surreal methods. this makes the game worth playing for the comedic nonsensical and satirical value alone. 

the cast of characters to interact with is amazingly diverse, and not in an annoyingly forced and hackneyed way, but in personality too. many of them have humourous character flaws, such as the sheriff's remarkably feckless and cavalier attitude toward due process; or his devoted understudy, who rather uniquely portrays autism in an endearing and positive light. i did not once feel that the game was overtly trying to advance a political nor social agenda on the player, which is often the case with other offerings in this genre.

it was a very wise decision to adopt this writing style as the story may have come off heavy-handed and sententious/preachy otherwise. this character building is absolutely unmatched by any other life simulator game i have ever played. the game even gives you the freedom to be as antisocial, spiteful and negative as you want, although this will obviously alienate yourself from the town community.

if you're looking to wind down from an exhausting day, i can think of few better games to play. if you're looking for a challenging and stressful skill-based game however, you may want to look elsewhere. my biggest regret is that i've finished most of it and that i'm going to have to wait a few more years for a sequel in order to see where the world's storyline is going next.",11835
2023-11-03,"if you liked my time at portia or even found it flawed with potential, sandrock improves on it in pretty much every way. if you like life sims/crafting games, you may like this. you get an unbelievable amount of content and customization and replayability for your money. it's not flawless, but i really like what's there a whole lot.

you do not need to have played my time at portia to play sandrock is stands alone.

plays well with either mouse and keyboard or controller (i used controller)

the community you live and work in will dynamically change over the course of the story, people will come and go from town, and everyone has something to say about major story beats.",11835
2023-11-03,i love this game been playing since ea and i can't wait to finally play the full story. when i first started playing i didn't think i would love it as much as i do. some of the game mechanics were different so for me there was little bit of an adjustment from portia. i loved my time at portia and i have had multiple replays on pc and ps5 and this game is definitely looking like it will be the same way. this series is definitely 10/10. so if you haven't played it you definitely need to be. my only thing i don't love is that when building your house/workshop everything is separate i do like that you can customize it pretty much however you want but make sure you know where you want to put it because moving it is kind of a pain.,11835
2023-10-29,i love this game so much. the npcs are everything and the story is so fun and sometimes deep. i actually care about this shanty town! such an upgrade from the already great my time at portia.,2875

2023-11-03,"this is one of my little ""guilty pleasure"" games since most of my games are multiplayer with friends.  i greatly enjoyed portia way back and i already had 350 hours in this game by the time it went 1.0
it was great being back in the my time world and i enjoyed playing it, even though certain aspects of the game i wish were left out (*cough*, woke crap, *cough*).  they actually toned it down for full release which i was happy to see because during the early access it was just too much in your face.  now it is more of an option if you want it, but not ""in your face"" unless you initiate.  good change because we aren't all wanting the same things out of our happy games.",11835

2023-11-02,the npc that sells pots and jars also sells figurines of herself and other townsfolk. there is deep lore if you look for it.,7446
2023-11-02,"graphics - very good but not amazing (edit - they added a new anti aliasing option in 1.0 which is much better!) it is pretty well optimised and loads very fast.
gameplay - great life/farming/building sim. it's not the best in all of its design choices, however, it has an original premise and setting and i have enjoyed my time with it very much as someone who loves games like stardew valley/harvest moon/story of seasons. the combat, while greatly improved from the first game, is still not the best and i tend to not bother with much unless there's items i need. the focus of this game is building and everything else is a bonus.
voice acting - ranges from good to poor. this is probably the weakest aspect of the game for me along with some of the writing.
audio - generally good music and sfx (edit - they improved a lot of the sounds in 1.0 so my complain in this area is gone).

in general it is an great game from devs that care and have kept the community up to date through the early access period. although not perfect, if you liked my time at portia this is better in every way.",7446

2023-11-02,"fantastic casual game if you like stardew valley, harvest moon, or even their other game my time at portia. what i like in particular is that even though it shares the same feel as portia the theme and mechanics are pretty different. there's more emphasis on scavenging, exploring, and looting relics. similar gameplay loop of using your scavenged parts to build better machinery, but it feels a lot more fleshed out. (combat is more polished too) definitely check it out if you like these kinds of progression/township types of games!",7446
2023-11-02,"imma write a proper review once i finish the game.

but basically? if you want a farming sim like stardew valley, nope, this is a construction and collectaton game.

2023-11-02,an amazing improvement on an already great series! if you enjoyed anything about the first game then you will definitely enjoy the second as they've only improved in every way.,7446
2023-11-02,"psa: if you want to play both portia and sandrock, play portia first! the added qol in sandrock makes backtracking to that game somewhat difficult.

the ""my time at..."" series is something truly special. i picked this one up on a sale iirc, back when the story ended with the destruction of the water tower, so i´ve had this game for a while now. kept starting over every time they added a new big feature and am pumped to finally play the full version, as soon as my  unbelievably slow internet connection is finally done downloading.

is this a good game? heck yeah. i can´t remember how many times i only wanted to finish that one request or finish building that one machine and ended up playing until 4am. the characters are all uniquely loveable, even characters i´d absolutely hate in real life (looking at you, arvio...), the quests will keep you going for a long time and the graphics are that beautiful cozy comic style that makes you believe that everything will be alright in the world.

so buy a train ticket and pick up that pickhammer. sandrock is waiting for you!",7446

2023-11-02,"this review is based off the early access gameplay i had, but the point i played it we had plenty of content. i loved it then, so that game plus extra/missing content added for the 1.0 release is only better.

i'm of mind that this and portia are the best of 3d stardew valley games. so if you're looking for something like that, you're in luck.",7446
2023-11-02,"i can't believe i've waited this long for a game this poorly optimized . 
yes its as bad as when it was in early access .
the garbage screen tearing is beyond all belief . do better!
but they made sure that paid dlc is out ...... that they worked on .
 
edit: in response to the stamped generic response from dev team : 
i did all that before even playing the game . 
any potato knows to go to settings before playing anything.
1080p 60fps cap med settings with v sync enabled and tearing all over the place .
 even in that shack you start in . 
it is beyond belief that you've had this long to make this and it runs this bad . 
worst part is i bought this junk ages ago in early access so i can't get a refund .",7446
2023-11-02,"this game is very enjoyable. fans of portia will definitely have a good time telling a new story about their time in the ""my time"" universe, but it's still alot of fun if u haven't played my time at portia. i particularly appreciated the sneaky little overlap hints about there being ""another star builder"" in portia ;). sandrock offers a bunch of new fun features like being able to build your house sims-style, and has a very satisfying amount of quests, side quests, and town events. the characters are dynamic, have decent storylines, and are voiced by some talented voice actors. it's easy to get attached. i loved being able to respond to letters in the mail, and feeling like i had a little more input over how i interacted with the city. and not for nothing, my ego enjoyed the good stroking that it got from a town that recognized me as it's heroine and awarded me thusly; something that i felt like i lacked when in portia. i, of course, have my preferences and complaints, but that's only because i love this game/series sooo much that too much is not nearly enough! this is a semi-cozy game, with lots to do and lots to see and it's very obvious that the devs put their hearts and souls into it. i can't wait to see what the ""my time"" gang has next for us! play this! now! it's a good time ^_^",7446
2023-11-02,"i wanted to edit my review and offer some more insight. so far, i'm about 30 hours in and i haven't even touched what i assume is the true surface of the plot. only barely. i get so absorbed in the addictive gameplay! and the hot people!!! aaahh!!! 

one thing i wanted to mention is an accessibility(?) feature. i'm not disabled, so i can't comment on that, but i have carpel instability in both hands which makes a lot of typing and button pressing painful after a long time. so having the auto-run feature is huge to me. god it really saves my life. controller or pc, even holding the joystick will hurt so pc is better with auto run. not many games offer this feature (stardew does not!) so it really helps me out. thanks devs!!!!!!",7446

they said the story is 70 hours long, pretty long game for the price.

just buy it and see for yourself, you wont regret it.",7446
2023-11-02,so good!!! they’ve really been listening to the players!,7446
2023-11-02,"an excellent game.

i took a chance on it during ea since it was nothing like the typical game i would play, (survival, mmos, shooters, etc.) and totally loved it.

the cartooniness can be misleading, it's actually quite a complex game, sort of a mashup of a rpg, singleplayer open world, farming/builder game with interesting npcs and relationships with them.

i see some power-gamer's whining about not having enough stamina to mine the entire world in a day, but they simply have not learned how to play yet.

the key to pacing your game play is based on how quickly you advance the main story quest line. meaning slow down!
if you want to mine more, build, explore, talk to npcs, and feel like you need to catch up, simply don't do the main story quests for a few days, or as long as you want. you control it completely. do not rush the main story quests.

power gamers have to rush everything. this is not that type of experience. slow down and enjoy the journey.",7446
2023-11-02,"this is one of the greatest games i have played. if anyone enjoys games where you build, explore and even enjoy an adventure, this game has a bit more of a sense of humor i really enjoy. i love my time at portia. this game has a lot more to offer and a challenge. i recommend it. can\t wait for it to come out on consoles.",7446
2023-11-02,"it's a good game, runs smooth, story's about as good as a chinese company can make and then half-bake into english. gameplay loop is satisfying as well, with either farming and gathering or combat, crafting, building. the world is... well, about as nice as a desert can be, and you can make it a bit less... desert-y by decorating, at least your plot of land, your house, your farms. character customization is..... decent. base models are expandable enough, plus you can swap out clothes pretty easily, if not a little... grindy, and there's a pretty decent variety as far as things go, nothing groundbreaking but at least nice enough.
however.
we all knew the price was going to hike up a bit on full release, but in addition to that, they waited until after release to drop all the dlc, a very disappointing half-step that the players definitely should have known better about before the game released. if i'd known there was gonna be dlc aafter release, i would have thought twice about even getting it. however, honestly it's still a really solid package, and some dinky cosmetics aren't going to really make or break your gameplay in most cases.
the game is probably a 7/10, it would have been an 8, however i'm not one to take this game's early-access transition dlc hat-trick lightly.
if you like farming and gathering, decorating and just general life-simmery, i would recommend you get it at a discount, it's 40 usd on release but i would get it for 30 at most.
",7446
2023-11-02,"big upgrade from portia. i don't really care about some stuff such as marriage and housing. i like it because everything you do has a main purpose amongst others which is the improvement of the town. it doesn't feel like you grind for nothing as in other games.

one thing i would put more resources into is the story writing. could be more polished and deep.",7446
2023-11-02,"this game is amazing. even in early access it was fun to play. it has a great story, amazing voice acting, great character customization, and so much more. it's one of the funnest games i've ever played. rarely does it feel repetitive and there's never not anything to do. it's a really nice game to sit down and play when you need something chill to destress with.",7446
2023-11-02,i like sand,7446
2023-11-02,love this game hope portia got update too this is the best game,7446
2023-11-02,"this is a wonderful addition to the world of ""my time at"" games! sandrock keeps that familiar feeling of running around smashing out commissions, but what really makes it stand out is the incredible character development of so many different npc's! the developers clearly put their heart and soul into this. thank you for creating such an immersive experience for us!",7446
2023-11-02,"stamina in the game is a big problem. with this new feature you cannot do a lot of things daily and compare to ""my time at portial"", this new game is very stressful because you wont be able to finish all the building quests in time compared to previous game, that was more relaxing.
so for me, i am probably going to play the game with mod that regenarates stamina. but why should i, why there is no option to set game difficulty to be ""normal"" and ""relaxing""?

edit: thanks for the dev for replying to my review. 
i will try the game now and hopefully i will enjoy it more, and update the review!",7446
2023-11-02,"this is in fact the best farming sim out there for me. i did love stardew valley, harvest moon etc. but this one here is over the top. everything is just so on point, a lot of qol improvements since portia. the voice actors are better than in most aaa titles. nearly everyone has a complete storyline to fill which makes the village so much more alive.
the gameplay loop itself is rewarding and let's you just every single day what you wanna do. time to fight? go to the dungeons. time to mine? go on an expedition! you want to spend your day optimizing your workshop? go, have fun.",7446
2023-11-02,"very fun and addicting game play.  so much more than just a crafting game.  the characters draw you in and the story line is fantastic.  i would definitely recommend, also so many mini games as well.  too much to do too little time.  edited:  also i would love to congratulate the producers at pathea games on still continuing to work on this game, fixing errors and adding more content.  excellent, love it!!!!",7446

if you loved stardew valley, stories of season and so on and so forth but you want more of a story, more romance and see what you've accomplished (like visible changes) then, this games absolutely for you. you'll have competition, love, family and quite the plot twists. its just wholesome and funny",7446
2023-11-02,i love it,7446
2023-11-02,"you can spend a lot of time in sandrock, that’s for sure. it’s pretty addictive in fact, but, like most addictions, ultimately just not that much fun…

interactions with townsfolks and monster fights are trite and repetitive, as are most other day-to-day activities: refuel and dust off your equipment, run from place to place (the lack of 'quick travel' becomes tiresome quickly, especially combined with the clunky navigation system), go eat to replenish your extremely limited stamina, desperately try to dig your way to much-needed resources, try to get home before you collapse, rinse, repeat.

much of the game revolves around crafting items within a time limit, but all of these have recursive (and therefore pretty much unforeseeable) dependencies, as well as ""you need this resource, but you can’t get that just yet"" scenarios, making the supposedly-cute grind-breaking interludes that are forced on you from time to time more stressful than anything.

in the end, i had to abandon sandrock because bugs prevented some progress-blocking missions from being completed, and i realized i just didn’t feel like starting a new game in an attempt to set things right. and not starting the game is the best advice i can give prospective players: unless you truly enjoy the 'cow clicking' genre, it’s best to look elsewhere.",7446

2023-11-02,super duper fun!! i have played my time in portia previously and absolutely love my time at sandrock. there's more to the storylines as well as more challenging in the game as you don't get some materials that easily.,7446
2023-11-02,"this is the first game i ever tried early access for, because even though portia had its issues on switch, i sunk several hours into it happily. i can firmly say i don't regret it for a moment. today is official launch day and even though my campaign will not be wiped, i'm excited to start over and enjoy everything again. this game sits perfectly at my interests. it's got a nice combat system, socializing, farming too, you can take quests at your own pace for the most part, you have so much customization for your character, house, and much more. yes, there is the very occasional non-game breaking bug, but those are always addressed by the devs and it feels like they listen to the fan base. you can really feel the love of the community and developers in this game. i can't wait to sink my teeth into 1.0.  thank you for my time at sandrock! i hope to see even more my time's!",7446

the cycle for me is
1. buy new interesting sim, builder, rpg, etc. game.
2. am super into it for a few irl days, maybe 2 weeks tops. (20 hours or so game time) 
3. as game progresses, and become more complex, start to feel like things are a chore.
4. completely forget about game.

for reference- visit my steam library to verify you are into the same types of games as i am.

[b]this is not that. this game captivates my attention, and is truly an interesting experience, with deep features that only grow as you progress. both through the story, and the amazing sandbox.




this game is a 10/10. a true masterpiece 
 my time at portia is a wonderful and beautiful experience, but sandrock elevates everything portia does to the nth degree.
you will not be dissapointed if you are into these kind of games.

highlights:
-different candidates for relationships/marriage
-tons of equipment/crafting to do
-many things to do as side quests if you need to get your mind away from the real world
-keeps you wondering what's gonna happen next

i see why this game could make a good first impression to people who never heard of pathea and their games before. graphics and npcs are nice to look at. unfortunately, that’s all.  

gameplay 3/10
difficulty 2/10
graphics 6/10
audio 3/10
story 1/10
sensitivity when it comes to serious topics (trauma, disabilities, death) 0/10
dev support 0/10
false promises 10/10

there sure were lots of problems with their previous game, my time at portia, devs simply weren’t capable to handle resources and promised way too much. the result was and still is an unpolished game full of bugs and missing content for several dateable npcs. console ports are still a mess too, although team17 and pingle are out for several years now and it was all up to pathea after this. last update in 2021 caused more problems than it solved and even more than 2 years later, pathea did nothing but announce some switch performance update. no actual update, no word about problems like missing items, stuck npcs, unplayable missions or fixes for playstation or xbox. they abandoned both, pc and console ports to work on sandrock instead.

there were many promises to learn from previous mistakes with portia and that everything would get better with sandrock. spoiler; [spoiler]it did not.[/spoiler] 

as other negative reviews already pointed out; sandrock kickstarter ended up being a scam.
many people backed because of 100k multiplayer stretch goal, which was easily reached. during early access the multiplayer actually did have story content for a while, just as devs promised. later, they suddenly decided to backtrack and removed it. their excuse; once more bit off more than they could chew and backers just have to accept this. no content, no chance for refund. 

there were more false promises during and after kickstarter. some examples;
- announced timespan for backers to share exclusive content was shortened
- all dateable npcs getting same amount of content - no, it ended up being the same as in mtap
- fixing none working kickstarter dlc codes - not for me
- promise to fix sensitive content - no

even if ignoring all of these mentioned above, i can still not recommend this game. devs took their previous game mtap, added desert location, more generic graphics, some new features and a different writing style. 

while simple gameplay and low difficulty are quite fitting for this genre, their storytelling is unbearable. memes, movie quotes, references, breaking the 4th wall, primitive thirst traps and puns galore, devs admitting at discord to copy entire npcs from disney and others. a ref or joke once in a while is nice though it’s far too much in this case. sandrock feels more like a parody or browsing social media rather than diving into a game with reliable npcs. also, very often those jokes are out of place or go way too far. for example;[spoiler]
- fake kidnapping a traumatized man’s pet to get his attention
- some npc pretending to be disabled because being too lazy to work 
- npc, who is worried their family member might die after already losing another one, is portrayed as fire spitting monster
- making corpulent npc a joke by adding ridiculous amount of food to his room[/spoiler]

devs also came up with the weirdest excuses for missing quality. like saying not to add optional (lol) voice acting for main character because they don’t want to limit players’ vision of their avatar too much. well, they actually don’t mind limiting our vision by bringing mc’s parents and childhood friend to the game, which of course is a way bigger limitation. 

writers are showing a huge lack in sensitivity and even made fun of some players at reddit and discord who brought up their sincere concerns. this behavior is mostly unprofessional.

writing also suffers from missing consistency; plot, timeline, even entire npcs. especially recurring npcs from mtap. [spoiler]mint’s whole backstory and childhood were changed to promote qi, ginger became implausible careless, not following doctors’ advices anymore, gale prioritizes rather meaningless daily work over his precious daughter and leaves her behind, while the formerly cold, detached and standoffish gust now is loud, unjustifiably aggressive and violent to make players sympathize with director’s favorite npc fang, who is permanently portrayed as everyone’s victim.[/spoiler] which leads to another problem; playing favorites. if you’re not interested in sad novel trope fang or stereotype himbo logan, be aware your favorite npc doesn’t get much content since writers focus on those two heavily.

i gave pathea a chance and wanted to support their growth. there’s nothing wrong with making mistakes if you’re willing to learn from them and show process. quite disappointing, this isn’t the case with pathea and sandrock. same mistakes all over again and even adding new ones. this is why i can’t recommend this game.

2023-10-29,"basically a 10/10.

i enjoyed my time at portia immensely and bought my time at sandrock almost immediately but i never got around to actually playing it.

my time at sandrock is just about the perfect balance of cute and pleasant without being too saccharine or blase.  it has been just the thing to help me stay positive in what has been a very challenging week.

if you're feeling down or just want to spend some time in a positive place to get away from it all i can't recommend the 'my time' series enough.  they're really fun, really intuitive, and filled with diverse activities to keep you entertained.  there is a small time management element to the game like stardew valley or harvest moon so you feel just enough pressure to constantly keep the gears turning.

2023-11-01,"i talked to a phone booth in the game that told me to leave a review with feedback, so i'm gonna do that!

this game's totally worth the asking price as-is, really elevates the farm life genre beyond stardew valley in pretty much every way (i loved stardew!), and offers a scintillating post-apocalyptic desert setting that feels really novel.

this game clearly has a lot to say about the way capital and a self-serving government can funnel money to prop up those who are already successful whilst leaving struggling communities to languish. there are tons of quests and side quests where characters ask if you can spot them money because the economy in sandrock is awful, and public servants will frequently lament the difficulty the town has getting government grants and the belief the residents should 'just move somewhere nicer' without regard for the town's unique culture or the financial hurdles one must jump over to be able to afford moving.

i'm still not done with the game's main story line even 80 hours in, but i'm excited to see how it further develops arguments between characters about the potential perils of technological advancement, because it seems like the game's religious faction is on the verge of lashing out at sandrock's local government for making use of scientific advancements to try and make the desert environment more habitable.

the game's premise also allows it to offer critique on world politics and modern society from the perspective of characters who are discovering information about us hundreds of years in the future. in the 'my time at' series' lore, to really simplify it, technology progressed with little oversight or regulation which made it trivially easy to start a world war that decimated most (all?) of the planet's surface and plunged the world into a new dark age, with people living underground until they were able to return to the surface and rebuild on top of the ruins.

i was surprised by the way this game tackles criticisms of the genre as being centered on mindless extractivism; the rationing of water from the local supply is a serious gameplay factory to account for, the logistical challenges of importing water from other towns is discussed frequently, and you're told as soon as you start the game that logging is illegal due to how few trees there are. plus there's a serious focus on scavenging for scraps and re-purposing those into materials.

this game really surprised me; i had kind of written it off because i thought the art style was a touch off-putting, but the narrative, character writing, and gameplay loops have all charmed and hooked me.

now, because that phone booth said the developers read reviews of the game for feedback, here's some very specific complaints i'd like addressed:

1. i'm in the summer of year two, partway through the bronco the kid quests, and i keep getting building commissions for items i cannot complete because i haven't met musa yet, which means i haven't gained access to the areas that unlock when he shows up in town. some of the commissions i've seen posted but can't complete are industrial machine tools, the advanced civil processor, and chromium daggers. i have these recipes already because i've been diligent about doing machine research with qi and buying recipes from the commerce guild, but i think the game should check to see whether the player has the ability to get the materials necessary to make something before it pops up as a commission.

2. after you first get the chance to express romantic interest in elsie, there's a line of dialogue where she declares 'i'm a legal adult' in frustration at the way her parents treat her. i appreciate the effort to make it clear she's not too young to ethically date, but she's very childish, and that line just makes her sound more childish. the mention of legality feels like a reassurance to the player, which doesn't make for good character dialog.

3. at some point, jumping with my camel started causing the game to freeze in the air for a half-second, after which it hits the ground and all four hoof-hitting-ground sounds play one right after the other. i swear the jumping animation used to be way smoother without that hitch and without the weird sound; i don't have performance issues in this game, so it's not lag as far as i can tell.

4. sometimes machines will get stuck saying they need to have the sand cleaned out of them, and no matter how many different positions or angles i try i cannot see a sand pile to remove with my duster. i found that picking the machine up and putting it back down fixes it temporarily, but i would prefer to just not have that issue, it's annoying having to finesse the position of a civil furnace that sits between two other furnaces.

5. i need storage to be sortable across all boxes instead of the 'sort' option just sorting that individual storage box, as well as the ability to search for an item in storage by name. i would also like for storage to always be accessible when you're gifting a character something. it's frustrating going through my 10? 12? large storage boxes, each with two pages of items to scroll through, especially since item names are only visible by using the left stick and going over every item.

6. finding relic parts for qi's side quests is too time consuming. i would prefer the quest-necessary relic pieces be located in chests in the ruins rather than in the dirt; i haven't found the scanner particularly effective at locating the quest pieces, so i've just been hitting every piece of dirt i can find on every floor hoping to uncover a relic piece eventually, which is extremely tedious when i also really need to move on to a new floor for the ores so i have the materials to complete my commissions.

7. the lack of tin scrap makes bronze more difficult to craft than stuff like chromium or manganese steel, and i'm not sure why that's the case given bronze is required for crafting so many different things.

8. there should be an option to turn on alerts for commissions that are going to expire that day. even if you're tracking your commissions that are due the soonest, you won't see when the commission expires on the main screen.

9. the shop interface should tell you whether clothing/accessories are better or worse than your current gear; i can't really compare my gear when it's all named something like 'stunt rider desert warrior visor' or 'bright defense team boots' since those names don't convey anything about their stats. it's also a struggle to remember my shirt provides, for example, '+136 health + 17 stamina +5% critical hit chance + negates poison status effects' when i'm in a shop going through a bunch of different shirts all with different stat buffs and effects.

10. add a setting that lets run be set as the default movement speed, please. using the 'toggle' doesn't work because there a bunch of annoying circumstances where the game toggles the player back to walking.

11. it's pretty easy to get stuck on obstacles in the sandrunning competition, and i lost a race because i got stuck under a boost pad ramp after hitting it from the side and had to forfeit to get out.

all of that said though, it's a great game, i'm looking forward to getting through the main story so i can go try my time at portia after this!",2157

2023-10-26,"[h1] basically mtap but better and more [/h1]
[h2] tl;dr [/h2]
basically, if you've played and enjoyed my time at portia, you'll enjoy this as it's more of the same but higher quality, there's more content, some of the kinks have been worked out and generally this is what i would classify as a good sequel.

if you haven't played mtap: this is essentially a ""cozy"" farm life sim game with all the genre staples (npc relationships, expanding operations, planning your day and your season in order to maximize €$, home customization, yada yada bing bong), except replace ""farm"" with ""mechanic"".
you take on requests for materials and finished products which progress in complexity as you upgrade and expand your workshop with new machines, better equipment, et cetera.

the game offers some customization of your experience, including a slider that speeds up or slows down the passage of in-game time. if you're into this genre of games, you will like this game. it's well put together, i personally haven't encountered any breaking bugs, it performs well, it looks nice and there's a lot to do.
[hr][/hr]

[h2]in detail[/h2]
[h3]the good[/h3]
[b]graphical quality[/b]
the game is quite a step up from portia, and comparing it to other offerings within the genre that adopt 3d visuals, i think only harvestella has it beat, in terms of technical quality (shaders, lighting, texture work et cetera) and details such as tufts of grass bobbing in the wind, sand particles and dust clouds blowing over arid terrain, npcs and mobs reacting to things happening around them.

[b]performance[/b]
i'm playing this on deck. when i first tried this on deck when i bought it roughly a year ago, i was forced to put the settings to a low preset, and my deck struggled to maintain 30fps. in the current version, in the year of our lord 2023, i have every graphical setting maxed out and the game is running between 30 and 60 fps on average. easily hitting 60fps in interiors.
all in all, with how the game looks, i think the performance is pretty impressive.

[b]sheer volume of content[/b]
i'm roughly 20 hours in to a new save on this version, and it feels as though i have yet to finish the first chapter in the story - i'm still witnessing new character introductions, npcs treat me as the ""new builder"". at the same time, literally every day since starting the game (i'm roughly at the end of the first in-game month) i've started the day with a new unique situation unfolding that day, ranging between character plot and main story beats, sometimes unlocking new features, sometimes unlocking new areas, sometimes just offering up new insights in characters or the world.
there also appears to be quite a breath of content. i haven't dipped my to into every system yet - i honestly don't even know roughly how much of the systems on offer i've engaged with. however, on top of the workshop, it appears you also gain access to more traditional elements such as farming plots and animal keeping. then there's a whole slew of activities available on certain days of the week, usually small in scope but quite numerous, such as making weekly deliveries of clay to the pottery artisan or helping with cleaning up the communal water supply. these may be simple activities, but they do help build a sense of community and add authenticity to the setting.
there's a lot more, but i can't be arsed getting in to it. just know that the main meat of the game (running the workshop) has quite a bit of depth, and at the same time there's breadth of content in the periphery.

[b]writing[/b]
people who played mtap know this already - the writers at pathea seem to have quite a bit of fun adding character to, well, the characters. this games' script has a lot of moving parts: when certain events trigger is directly influenced by your actions as a player, so the order in which events happen can't be guaranteed. despite this, the tone of the script is quite consistent. even if when you jump from a serious scene where the titular town is under assault to one where a writer is receiving eloquently phrased harsh critiques from a kid (""i'm in your tawget demogwaphic"" cracked me up) and you can see his heart break a little. this is all backed up by surprisingly good voice acting. the voice cast is varied, mostly fits the characters being depicted and the direction is excellent. this is a step up from portia.
i think they spent more time proofreading the game script as well, as even the little stuff like item and skill descriptions have been immaculate so far.

[b]game flow[/b]
this is hard to pin down exactly, but the game flows really well once you get into the rhythm of it. anyone who's played a game in this genre will know what i mean by that; you get into a routine, find out what works and what doesn't, and then you start scaling up and becoming a giant capitalist with a zillion weird lil machines churning out products, earning you a tidy profit. in sandrock, somehow, even early game resources kept feeling worthwhile to amass, and i ended up doing my best to figure out what to spend the day in in order to keep the machines running with stuff which would allow me to most efficiently complete next days' comissions.


[h3]the subjective[/h3]
[b]character art[/b]
love it or hate it, portia character designs were distinct. in sandrock, the style is a bit less pronounced. personally, i like it better this way, as i found the portia characters veered between distinct and grotesque.

[b]focus/direction[/b]
this game definitely requires you to explore and experiment a bit. a lot of information is available in-game, especially once you've discovered something e.g. a material will have details on how to procure it once obtained.

[h3]the bad[/h3]
[b]a sense of confusion and/or being overwhelmed[/b]
this game has the exact same issue as portia: it's front-loaded, and it doesn't always succeed in explaining all of its' mechanics due to the sheer amount of stuff there is to see and do. some things go completely unexplained and just sit there in the ui, staring at you accusatorily, daring you to interact with them and finding out what will happen. 
there's a lot of systems which is all fine and dandy, but you're also not incentivized to take your time figuring them all out. this makes especially the first few days of the game play out in a hectic fashion. i had to re-learn a bunch since it's been a hot minute since playing mtap, and starting this fresh would probably be worse. it's a shame, because i can imagine people being scared off by this. heck, i put down portia and almost never came back to it when i first played it, due to this exact issue.

[b]simultaneously polished and full of skung[/b]
this game contains nintendo levels of detail and polish in some areas, and gets extremely skungy in others, and these disparate levels of polish overlap at times. to illustrate: i'm watching a nicely choreographed cutscene complete with great lighting and what appears to be a blend of mo-cap and manually done character animations, lending it legitimacy while keeping consistent with the general art direction of the game. the cutscene ends. my character automatically starts pathing towards an arbitrary position, gets snagged on a fence, runs in place for a moment, phases out of existence, reappears a few meters away, and two npcs pop in next to them. all the while little shrubs are waving in the wind as a tumbleweed rolls by in the beautifully rendered sand drifts.
to be honest, this could be seen as a positive as well, considering the fact that all of portia nested comfortably in the janky skungzone, so it's a triump pathea have managed to elevate their work to this level. however, the disparity means that the skungness stands out more admidst the nintendonean polish levels, whereas in portia the entire vibe was skung so it just fit.",2257
2023-10-24,"my time at sandrock is a fun farm/life sandbox game and the sequel to my time at portia, which i also recommend.

good:

housing is a big factor when it comes to farming games, in this game you can customize your farm however you want, you can make your land mainly like a factory, farm or a beautiful homestead while not worrying about the other two as much.

commissions are the main money maker in the game that also rewards you with a good amount of relationship for certain characters and workshop reputation points. i highly recommend doing these daily and picking the most profitable ones as money is more important than the other two rewards.

saving midday is not a common thing to happen in farm/life sim games and that is why i really like this game, (portia doesn't have this feature). also that comes with midday saves is when you complete a quest or commission you auto save and have a quick save which is really handy to have.

there are a large variety of weapons, you can have 4 types of melee weapons, multiple ranged weapons and even some unique weapons that can't be crafted. each melee weapon has its own style and combo, whether it be daggers for fast but weak attacks or a greatsword which is slow but does a lot of damage.

decent:

relationships in this game follows every other farm/life sim game, there isn't a weekly limit but if you give an item too much they will like it less. the game is good at indicating if there is a relationship event going on as it will be marked on your map but the game doesn't really tell you if you even have events available for a character or if it is just end of current build.

there is a skill tree that you can do, but maxing out those 4 skills basically just fill up the entire tree leaving no real choice in the end. skill points are only gained by doing those specific skills. though i do think this idea is pretty neat, i will always prefer character levels rewarding skill points (portia did this).

farming had a step-up from portia, where you are able to place farming plots anywhere on your land instead of planter boxes. you can easily and efficiently plant items the higher the toolbox up to a 4x4 planting/watering/fertilizing area which is quick and easy. farming has some flaws as well, farming early game is terrible. since it is just inefficient. you have to apply a lot of fertilizer, water and straw just to make a profit, you can't automate farming either so you have to constantly be on watch to water.

bad:

!!they added the feature to group items and move them in bulk in the 1.0 update!!

moving housing items is a real chore, there is no area select so you have to move each individual item one by one (including farming plots). i would just recommend using your character instead at some points. moving your house with 2+ stories is also annoying as whenever you move it, you have to move each individual story top to bottom and if you had items in the house after reapplying those stories, some might get removed since staircases don't remember their last known location but instead have a predetermined location every time you add a new floor.",2332
2023-10-24,"23 oct 23:
the story has an intriguing story and it is quite rewarding to see the impact you make on sandrock. without any spoilers, i'm very much looking forward to the next chapter in the ""my time"" world. i think most of the characters feel unique (to the other townsfolk, at least). the romance storylines i followed were sweet, but there are some characters that you will not interact with or be able to romance until very late game, which is kind of frustrating.

but to be honest, the game has a laundry list of basic quality audio, graphics, and  issues, even as the release date is right around the corner. also, if you grind through the storylines, some progression issues and quest overlapping are going to happen (at least during the pre-release phases).

much like its moniker, sandrock needs further polishing before it becomes ""the jewel of the eufala"".",2332
2023-10-23,"my time at sandrock improves a lot on what my time at portia already got right. i played both, and even in early access, sandrock got me playing nonstop for a week. the character and object models, the combat, the characters, the story, the dungeon dwelling aspect. i just really love this game! the water and tree cutting mechanics are really innovative and fun and add a good kind of difficulty in the game. you can really tell the love the devs put in this game. i def recommend it. 

",2437
2023-10-22,"a worthy successor to my time at portia. better combat, better production system, better everything. the only downside is the construction u/ux, way clunky in comparison to portia. upgrading the house is also more complex, it would be a plus for serious players, however, it is not beginners friendly. all i have to say is, looking forward to my time at lucien! i wanna be a predominantly fighting builder or be part of the civil corps!",3305
2023-10-21,fantastic game! a few bugs tho but nothing game breaking. i restart the game every 2-3 hours because resources will stop showing up or all the characters will start walking into the wall. a quick restart will fix it. but other than that this game is fun. the characters arn't boring. they all have their own personality and the story is fantastic. i'm giving this an 8/10. it's a solid game.,3009
2023-10-21,"my favorite game of all time. there's enough content, surprises, and humor to keep me playing for over 400 hours and the full game hasn't even been released yet. no other game can compare in depth. apparently, the desert farming and sandstorm mitigation techniques are based on real science, so i even learned something new. for those who hate fighting monsters, like i do, build up your level through tree cutting and mining first.",3009
2023-10-21,"having finished the game i can say this game was much, much bigger than my time at portia to begin with.

now for the rest of the game, i've loved it, i think i would have loved it even more if i hadn't played it piecemeal from the early access so everyone gets it better now waiting for the full release.

the story is fun and delightful with nice complete arcs.

i find myself loving everything around, the characters are delightful and varied with their personalities. 

the quests all seem to make sense and the side quests are nice, the main quests mostly aren't timed so you set your pace, mostly... there are forced gaps/delays, so if you are like me that means breakneck speed. core gameplay loop is solid.

though my favorite self-indulgence in this game is the fact that everything you make that is bigger than hand sized exists in the world. you can go out and see it all, from elevators, to shrubs, to buildings and more.  the world really does change with your actions and it shows there in the world, 

there are still some bugs and little minor things but as long as you don't care too much you will enjoy the game.",3009

2023-10-23,"[h3]wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle[/h3]

the #1 issue with this game is bloat. according to the devs, the story is 3.29 times longer than my time at portia – already a pretty long game, mind you. i know “more game” is supposed to be good, but sandrock overstays its welcome and makes you wonder when it finally ends. imagine watching a movie, and after an epic showdown with the main villain, when you’re ready for the credits to roll - another movie begins instead. it means you need many hours of your life to complete the story in one sitting and not lose track of it. there are more than twice side quests than portia, too - and most of them are on a timer. i ended up so overwhelmed by quests that i began refusing them at some point, which in turn led to a frustrating feeling of missing out on content. there is more of everything else as well. there are hundreds of items - scrap alone comes in like 15 varieties - making inventory management an ever-present annoying part of the gameplay. 

if a developer from pathea is reading this - i would like you to grab a sheet of paper, write “less is more” on it, then hang it somewhere in the office where everyone can see it every day. i have no need for 20 romantic interests in the game, if the majority of them will lack character, quests, unique items, voice acting... give me just 3 but make them really fleshed out and rich with content. case in point: nia - she got so much backstory, relevance to the plot, unique events and ties to the main character that she makes every other romance look like an unnecessary waste of development resources.

[h3]cardboard protagonist[/h3]

sandrock is a heavily narrative-driven game. for 100-150 hours you will be listening to dialogue with multiple people, constantly referencing your character. for some reason, even though your character is not a “blank slate” and has a backstory, parents, childhood friend etc. you are free to name him/her whatever you want. this creates a huge problem for voice actors. you see, expecting them to voice dozens of custom names like codsworth or vasco would be unrealistic, so they only had two options - either skip the player character’s name entirely, or to use generic “the builder”. as a result, dialogue constantly loses meaning and feels jarring. for example, “me, harris and you will go to the cave” turns into “me and you will go to the cave”; “s.s. harris” (ship name) turns into “s.s.” (???), and even though you can be a best friend to people and marry them, they will still refer to you as “the builder” (even if there are other builders present in the same scene). 

what exacerbates this issue is the silent protagonist. which on its own perhaps wouldn’t be that bad - if mi-an didn’t exist. mi-an is also a builder, and so in most scenes she effectively speaks for both of you and ends up praised for things you did. all leading to a feeling of the player character being a sidekick to mi-an. while i realize voicing the whole 250.000 words main story is unrealistic, this just leads back to my point - why did they write a huge story like that?

[h3]howdy, pardner![/h3]

sandrock feels awfully derivative - it just grabs about every single gameplay element and design decision from portia and carefully copy/pastes them into a new game. the only meaningful difference here is the new desert setting, and frankly - it’s terrible and doesn’t work for a game like this. you will struggle to tell the seasons apart - it’s always just sand, with the (very) subtle coat of white in winter and green in spring. outside of an occasional sandstorm the weather is also static for the most part – you will not see any snow and i only witnessed rain 1 (one!) time after 100+ hours into the game. of course, there are setting-based complications: like you need water (rare and expensive) to cool your machines; sand accumulates on them over time so you need to clean it; you are not allowed to chop trees near the city etc. however, ultimately all of it feels like busywork, aimed at making your early game more painful and tedious than it needs to be.

narratively, it’s just a mix of every wild west cliché. your will hear “howdy!” from about every character, even the newcomers. there are sheriffs, bandits, cowb... i mean, yakboys. which i could probably live with, but the huge appeal of a my time game is to be able to improve your community and see a meaningful impact of your actions over time. i still remember building a fast travel system in portia and how much of an achievement it felt. here the main theme is greenification of the desert however, which essentially makes you feel like a sidekick to botanist characters and a glorified gardener, as the builder stuff takes a backstage to planting trees. furthermore, the first half of the exceedingly long story just has you doing barely meaningful stuff, with the common theme being “bandits broke our bench/water tower/farm/statue - please repair it!”. yes, there are guns now - but they feel like a gimmick, requiring entering an “aiming” mode, and are so ammo-hungry that using them is just not sustainable, unless you enjoy grinding mines to make more bullets. you do get the ability to join civil corps as a deputy this time round, but ultimately this only serves to further distract you into becoming a “jack of all trades”.

[h3]rpg and progression[/h3]

sandrock tries to be more of an rpg, with everything from your chair to your horse coming in multiple tiers of quality. you can also “refine” an item to increase its level and quality by throwing rare gems you first have to grind at it. at first i thought this to be a very cool system, as i imagined it would be possible to upgrade any piece of clothing indefinitely and make it competitive in the late game - but you’re only able to upgrade anything up to 10 levels above its “required level”, making the system pointless. furthermore, this system only made matters worse as for the first half of the game i had to actively avoid the “blue” quality commissions - because i simply did not have the required gems at the time to make such quality items.

also, while there are levels and skill points – you will easily unlock everything provided you play long enough, so there are no builds or anything like that. the perks are subtle buffs rather than something that has great impact over the gameplay. as such, the main form of progression comes in the form of gear - and is fully tied to the main story, which unlocks more areas and resources. while you unlock bronze and iron relatively early on and at a steady pace, it is unfortunately followed by a very long and stale midgame where you don’t unlock anything until late game, where you get chromium and aluminum almost back to back.

[h3]writing[/h3]

sandrock is filled to the brim with memes and popular culture references, and every quest title is an attempt at a witty pun. it all looks quaint and fun at first, but quickly grows exhausting, especially as the writers make npc go more and more out of character just to throw in another “mic drop!”. the writing feels too concerned with the “current day” agenda for a game that’s supposed to take place in a post apocalyptic setting. for example, a woman i offered my help said she does not accept “free help” from strangers, and almost reported me for sexual harassment. and after that a homosexual man made advances on my male character without my consent, or ever speaking to that particular character to begin with. some characters are so obnoxious i found it really hard to co-exist with them in the same game.

[h3]tl;dr upgrade? more like side-grade![/h3]

my time at sandrock was almost 200 hours full of adventure and emotions. just like portia, this game has quite a few enjoyable things. pretty graphics, some quality of life additions, even the optimization is finally half-decent! unfortunately, all the diamonds are buried deeply under the sand of a game that is too ambitious for its own good.

2023-10-21,"if you played and liked my time at portia, go ahead and grab this. it's a bigger and better game in basically every way.

if you haven't played it, well, this is a farming game where you don't farm much. specially because now you are in the middle of the desert, and you can't just fill your watering can from a well. instead, most of what you do is building; do some ruin diving, collect resources, smelt ore, and bang out the things sandrockers commission you to make. sleep and repeat.

in the meantime, you will have the chance to get to know these colorful characters better and learn a fair bit about the post-apocalyptic world they live in. with a much longer duration, this game manages to flesh out much of the worldbuilding the first title only alluded to.

production values are not in the aaa ballpark. the ea version i played had some pretty bad pop-in issues, and while most of the dialogue is voiced, some side content isn't. still, this is a game with heart, and if you are looking for something cozy to put a solid hundred hours in, you can certainly do a lot worse.",3009
2023-10-20,"this game is so much fun, i think i enjoyed all the character's personalities and the many voice actors the game had. i read a review before that said there is always a reason to do just one more day. this is so true. i'm about 120 hours game play in. i like to spend a lot of time doing side quests, gathering, and building. i want to be a rich builder. i just now got through a major plot in the story. i'm sure there is still hours of game play left. i played portia before when it first came out on switch. i struggled with it for some reason. building was hard for me and... i gave up. now that i played this one on pc, i think i'm actually ready to go back and give portia a try again. the story and all the mentions of portia makes me want to play it because i read that the timelines of the game are actually parallel? so while we are working hard to grow sandrock, there is a ""star builder"" in portia working hard to grow portia. now i must know the story! 
what i disliked is a pretty small list. the mounts can be a little glitch sometimes when they are following you. other times for some reason i can't seem to interact with an object, i have to run around and click on other things then try to come back to it. the most annoying one is sometimes if i have to pause and go out of game to do something on my desktop. when i come back, the mouse is missing and i can't click on stuff in my inventory. i normally have to save and restart for it to fix. pretty minor dislikes, none of them break the game. oh and for some reason when i pose with my camel a certain pose, the bottom of his mouth disappears! its creepy what the inside of his mouth looks like with no bottom of his face.",2515
2023-10-20,"first steam review... i love this game and i loved my time at portia as well. this is a great sequel that feels endless. i love the customization they added to this game and if you're having hesitations, i say go for it. i waited months until i got it on sale and thought i'd leave it alone until full release... that obviously didn't happen hahha. i got curious opened up the game and have been enjoying it immensely despite the initial hesitation i had from other reviews.  all in all this game is loads of fun and  makes a nice sequel to its predecessor with added bonus of even more content and more interesting npc's.",2515
2023-10-17,"tldr - this game is a gem with lots to do to keep you busy and runs well with minimal bugs.

   long main story, tons of sides, loveable characters, and scratches that builder itch you may have.  most of the lines are voice acted.  can get repetitive later levels and the story, whilst good, goes off the rails.  overall totally worth the price per content as in my first play though took 140 hours and i still didn't do everything i wanted... on play through 2 this time for a better set up to /romance all the characters =p.  oh, and you can save almost anytime minus like a super important event, but can usually save before or after, you don't have to wait for the sleep cycle.

  there are minor bugs, usually fixed with a reload.  some resources are a little too limited imo that commissions will flood your board.  resources start getting cluttered late game.  some features that were in portia are not here.  the game is set up for dlcs, which is fine.  i'm curious to see the generation features.  one of my npc couples had a baby later in the game, was a total mind melt, though this feature for the main character won't be released till launch.
 
  i can't really comment on the multiplayer aspect, only from what i've read from other users.  but, i'm judging this game as a standalone single player experience.  and at it's core, is a great game.  if there was some way to make multiplayer have different homesteads, i think that would make it ideal, but i think it's just sharing one property.

i can't wait till november 2 to finally play the ""complete"" version of the game, but so far it's been an amazing journey and i will definitely keep playing the game for a long time, romancing different characters, replaying the story, enjoying everything this amazing world has to offer. thank you to everyone that has made this game possible, i love it.",2742

+ when does the main story end?! (aka: a lot of stuff and it takes a long time to get there)

2023-10-20,"wanted to write this before the official release of the game. 

i have 221 hours played on this game, spread over about three saves. if that doesn't speak about how much stuff there is to do, even in early access, then i don't know what would. 

obviously, the start was a bit rough, but overall the game was still pretty good. it continued improving as pathea kept listening to player feedback and making good decisions, eventually leaving me to believe it's one of, if not the, best game of its kind. beating even, i know i'll get questioned for this but whatever, stardew. it easily crushes portia, too. i loved portia, but sandrock improved on soooo much. in portia, it feels like you were just shoved into having to make a bunch of commissions, but in sandrock you get introduced to everything one at a time, which makes it easy to pick up. it also made it so it's much easier (and quicker) to start a relationship with a person, but i'll get into that later.

the main thing of the story is uncovering the truth about what's been going on in sandrock. the geeglers, the insidious, but dashingly handsome bandit logan, and even... an evil empire?! you'll play throughout all these events and make the town a thriving success like it used to be. you'll meet a ton of loveable, or annoying (yan), characters and get to know them and their story as you progress through the game.

another improvement is the combat. combat felt slow and sluggish in portia, and most farming/sim/crafting/rpg games do it poorly, but sandrock makes combat interesting and a little more interactive. it may not be overwhelmingly complex, but it's also not move and click. there are a few different melee weapons, each with their own bonus stat and fighting style, and then three, i think, ranged weapons: a pistol, rifle, shotgun. as i said, combat isn't super easy or simple, but it also isn't too hard. i think it's a definite improvement from portia and games like coral island or stardew that just have you face an enemy and spam click.

now i know i've compared this game to stardew twice already, and i will admit, it's not fair. both are great games with two massively different playstles. but i am judging both as a game about farming and/or crafting and social sims, like they both are, to some degree, but sandrock is a lot more story-oriented and emphasizes on combat, crafting, and exploration. so i'll stop comparing the two!

now on to make this simple:

character creation + development - 7/10. i want to give this a higher rating, but the character customization is lacking, especially for the males with no good facial hair options. maybe that'll change in the official release? idunno. anyway, i give it a 7 because you can get your character to a good looking person, and then the development of that character, including the adventures they go through and how you choose to treat people, matters too. i think it's a beautiful example of the fact that, sometimes, one person can make all the difference.

combat - 8/10. a good rating, i enjoyed the combat greatly. obviously it's no dark souls or anything like that, but it's a huge improvement from portia. and being able to choose a weapon you specialize in, or just specializing into all of them and switching between them, is so fluid and nice; especially when you get the shotgun. good lord is that fun.

exploration - 6/10. this would also be higher, but sadly a lot of the exploration is gated behind time and requirements. but when you do unlock a new zone, there isn't much to explore. yeah you get new materials to craft new and better equipment, but it does feel like you're stuck in a desert and can't go anywhere. 

socializing/romance - 9/10 beautiful! i loved getting to know all the characters in sandrock. i even got to bff with almost every available npc and got to know their story, though some of it came from game progression. but the romance is so much easier and better than portia. you can give gifts, go on ""play dates"" and eventually go on real dates and then get married! i haven't really dabbled in the marriage part because nia isn't available for romance yet as of writing this. *shakes fist* but i do know there are even children to be had! exciting! you won't get bored of any of these lovely sandrockers. 

graphics - 10/10 for the type of the game it is, the graphics are gorgeous. i love farming/dating sims, but usually have to settle for less-than appealing graphics, like potion permit, sun haven, etc. but with sandrock, you don't have to settle! they definitely made better looking people and areas than in portia. i hated how the heads were in portia, but in sandrock, it's all good, baby!

overall; the game is just.. awesome. i give it a solid 8/10, i have a few gripes and problems with it, as with every game to be fair, but maybe that'll change in the official release. is it worth it full price? heck yes! buy it. you will not be disappointed. it has a lot of replay-ability and tons of content. and here's hoping we'll get more content as time goes on! but yeah, that's my review of sandrock. i never write reviews for games unless they leave a great impression on me, i think the only other review i've ever made is on stardew. but yeah, anyway, sorry to digress. i definitely recommend the game, especially if it's on sale? heck of a deal. 

get it. play it.

and remember! 

conserve water!",2515
2023-10-20,"one of my favourite games, ever.
the story is engaging (200 hrs and i'm still not finished), the characters are interesting and lovable, the scenery is gorgeous, the pets are so. freaking. cute. and the controls are never clunky. i despise grinding in farming/crafting sims and that was not a problem here.
plenty of clothing and customisation options (could use a few more hairstyles), diverse cast and plenty to do at all times.
this game is visually stunning, has tons of character and the dialogue is super funny, i was not expecting to laugh so much. i was very invested in the main story, and everytime i felt smug about accurately predicting something, another twist would knock me off my pedestal. 
weeks before full release, my only qualms with this game are sandfishing (annoying but easily ignored) and building/decorating your house. there are too many size and placement restrictions for my taste. the other sets look great with similar assets that we have access to, so i'm hopeful for improvement.

2023-10-15,"i can tell this is still early access - i've run into a few bugs here and there (nothing major, one's purely visual and the other didn't prevent me from finishing the quest, so that's fine. devs - when i went to do the part time help quest, i had 5 manure in my inventory already so it was flagging the quest as done, but cooper wouldn't accept it until i picked up 5 manure)

minor bugs so far aside, it's a super fun game that builds on the things in my time at portia, while also changing things up enough to feel distinct as a game. i'm really enjoying my time so far, and i look forward to seeing how the rest of the game goes!",3497
2023-10-15,"i prefer to play simulation games on handheld platforms, so i'm pretty sad to see there's no real functionality on the steam deck despite there being a switch release in the lineup. on deck, the main menu just freezes once you've made your first selection and you can't back out or move forward, though the store lists it as ""playable"". i know the game is still in early access despite the full release version popping up when i load in, so hopefully this will change, because i really loved what little i played through on my pc last year.",3497

2023-10-13,"loads of content, enjoyable and rewarding game loop",2729
2023-10-13,"what a massive improvement from my time in portia, which was already an incredible game! 
many many improvements overall. most notably the graphics, improved character models, visuals & aesthetics of the game! 

the biggest and greatest change for me. is the storage. yes correct, storage and inventory management is a thing of the past with this new system! you can now auto-store all stacks of items across all your stashes at once! thus allowing you to keep unique items on you, but stack up all your inventory junk instantaneously. 
not only that. but your stashes act as a sort of backpack now. anything in your stashes count as being on your person for the sake of crafting, handing in commissions etc.. 
this is a game changer as the most tedious park of portia that burnt me out and prevented me from completing it. was the constant inventory management. in sandrock you can now auto-store all stacks then continue the focus on having fun! 

and boy is it fun! there is 2-4x the content than in portia, and with inventory management to the wayside. you can really dive in and just get lost in the experience!

i can't really find any faults with the game. for the price you are paying this is def a 10/10 product imo.",2729

2023-10-13,"great game, lots of options",2729
2023-10-13,"this game is still in early access so my feedback is based on this. 
i cannot recommend this game enough! i've been playing early access since about january this year and it's been incredible to see the game grow, as well as seeing how much the devs care about player feedback and incorporates it into the game. i've played through it a couple of times now and am still eager for the full release, as it's got solid replayability. 

pros:
+ story and writing are well done, fleshed out and engaging (and very funny!). it's also nice to have a post-apocalyptic game with a more positive spin on it, focused on rebuilding the town/nature.
+ engaging with npcs is integrated into the storylines so it feels more organic (rather than having to go out of your way too much to build friendships)
+ fixed lots of qol issues that were present in portia so it's far smoother and quicker to build
+ if you've got cozy game fatigue where it's all farming and fishing, this is a wonderful reprieve from that. while there is farming and fishing involved, it's mainly optional so i tend to avoid it altogether. 
+ so! much! to ! do!

cons
- there are still some bugs, so for those who haven't played i recommend waiting until full release to allow time for polish",2729

2023-10-13,"hi there, i love this game. i also played my time at portia, and its really good to have that knowledge and have it extended into this game. it really helps. not necessary, but you do get a sense of being really part of having the feeling of understanding the rich storyline and its people, in the game. yes of course i would recommend this game. on both games i was an early access player, and we ea players went through the gamut of getting the bugs, and the changes until the game was brilliant in all its glory. i have read a lot of the posts and feedback of those submitting their ideas and gripes. its real life stuff and its because we have partaken in it, is because we feel a real part in its making. - 'the 'my time at'series! lol.  i was thinking the other day that it would be great to just whistle the horse and have it be there, because i do tend to get myself in fixes sometimes and really, would just love my horse to come and get me- especially when i've been at the mines all night and the bus stops have closed for the night. i usually just pass out on the road! lol. good thing i wake up in the morning and find myself with enormous black eyes.  i didn't like the panda eyes when they introduced it, for you do walk around looking like a zombie, and then you have to go to the general store and buy the cream to cover the black. this game is so busy and richly full. there is so much you can enjoy doing in it.  i love the sandrunning game where you get into a sand sled and you go down this enormous sand hill and avoid/ try to avoid huge monoliths  in the way and you steer it and gain special point awards. it is really fun.  i did have a boyfriend in this game but he kept running away from me, being too immature i guess, so i scrapped that and didn't want to get complex with anyone. i love just working hard, being the best at what i do and making loads of money with a fantastic house! lol. besides, there are beautiful animals that i own now and they keep me company! there is sooo much fun in this game. i love it. it is nearing its full completion in the making - only a month or so away.  if the guys at my time at series make more, i know i will be sure to be a follower and a life long fan. thanks pathea. :-)",2729

2023-10-12,"if you love life sims, character customization, home editing + rpg story quests, fighting, dungeon and ruin diving for materials and treasure with the sweet cherry on top of romance including marriage and kids. lemme tell you sandrock is a game that will keep you busy & happy. not only an epic single player mode with choices that matter and npcs with actual depth and personality, but a fun multiplayer mode that shares so much content with the singleplayer however is like a whole new game in itself and i was pleasantly surprised.  

although i do recommend going in patiently, its a game where you work to unlock and evolve, there is so much to do. you can take commission requests to build, go on dates with different activities and personal touch, even spar with npcs as friends or play cards. so much to do but i wont spoil that.

2023-10-11,"if you liked my time at portia, then you'll like this game too, or perhaps even better.
after 100 hours into sandrock in 9 days, it's probably time for me to take it slow from now on. i've finished most of the main story stuff at this point but i think there's still a new area to unlock. it's been a long wait for sure. i bought the game the first day it was available on steam and waited till the main story questline was finished to finally play it. i'd say that the wait was worth it. overall, sandrock is better than portia in almost every aspect. i especially enjoyed the story and the characters. however, the game still feels a bit glitchy. there were a few crashes, the interact option sometimes won't appear immediately, my horse can fly, etc. i'll definitely have another playthrough once the definitive version is out (likely a year or so later i guess). 

here's a few things that i enjoyed the most:

1. the world

the view of sandrock is quite breathtaking and i often find it enjoyable just walking amongst the wilderness while gazing at the mountains. the biome and monster design is certainly a whole level better than portia (at least they make sense now). it's also quite rewarding to find little bits of lore here and there. 

2. story and characters

there's a lot more to the story of sandrock than portia, but in order to not spoil anything i'll just say that i liked it a lot. kudos to the writers. it also fleshes out the world a lot more that i'm now looking forward to the third game (please let there be a third game). i like the villains a lot, too. i especially like relatable villains. most of the romanceable characters are interesting and unique. i really enjoyed learning more and more about them and seeing some of them grow as a person. i might be biased, but i feel like the guys have more diverse personalities than the girls? like, i feel like all of the girls are the friendly and approachable type, but some of the guys need a lot more time to warm up to you. i kinda want to see a girl character being a jerk for a change. also, i suspect that unsuur is the dev's favorite considering how many quests he gets lol. 

despite how much i enjoyed the game, here's a few things that i didn't enjoy:

1. pacing (somewhere around mid-game to be more exact)
there's too much waiting mid-game that the game became kinda boring. since i played portia before, i was fairly familiar with the mechanics from the get go so i almost never wasted time on completing mandatory commissions. yet almost every main story quest requires you to wait for at least a day for the story to progress after you finished the job. maybe that's not so bad in itself, but nothing else was going on meanwhile except the main quests. the lag between the second abandoned ruins and the third was ridiculously long, while the forth was unlocked far too quickly in comparison (i hadn't even gotten to the bottom of the third ruins when the next was unlocked). the extremely repetitive guild commissions made it even worse. day in and day out, i was just handing out the same three or four items to the same people. the only thing i needed to gather was ores during that period and digging dirt for ores isn't exactly my idea of fun.

2. rival (or the lack of it...)
higgins was one of my favorite characters in portia and i was pretty disappointed with mi-an. it felt like she was just arbitrarily included in some parts of the story and absent in the rest. her character was rather uninteresting as well to the point the i rarely bothered talk to her. i'd talk to the non-romanceable townsfolk after most main story events but not her, that's how uninterested i was. her character is just inherently 'good' that she never had any character development (or perhaps there is but i'm not friends with her so i didn't get to see her events). the rest of the guild was just a joke. i don't feel any sense of accomplishment being called 'the best'. (my workshop score is currently around 20,000 and the second place is around 3,000. i almost feel bad for them.)

3. play and date
i haven't dated anyone yet since a certain someone only becomes available very late into the game, so i've only been hanging out with characters as friends so far. i noticed that characters now have multiple possible responses to each dialogue option so it's more worthwhile to chat with them multiple times. however, the activities available aren't that much of an improvement compared to portia imo. there are a few different mini-games, and that's it. it's basically the same formula. i was hoping that they could've made the dates less awkward  but perhaps romantic dates are better? oh well, i guess i'll find out soon. i know that with so many dateable characters in game it would be quite difficult to make the socializing aspect of the game more engaging, but still, no improvement or whatsoever is kind of a let down.",2579
2023-10-11,"i love this game so much, i hope there would be more stories and added citizens!, most of all it would be amazing to be able to visit portia!, more clothes and hair styles to choose from.

2023-10-10,"as someone who was pretty neutral regarding my time at portia, this game just is a big step up in every regard.
the visuals are better, the style more appealing. the jank has been reduced (albeit not completely eliminated) and everything is just more polished. better sounds, music, voice acting. huge quality of life improvements in terms of building and inventory management.

overall, it's my time at portia +1, improved in every regard. it's a long game with a huge storyline and a memorable cast of townspeople. get this game if you enjoy the genre of farm/build/lifesims!",2733
2023-10-10,"i love this game! i really enjoyed the first game, my time at portia, and i'm impressed by the improvements both to quality of life and to characterization that sandrock brings. i love that this game isn't just a copy-and-paste of portia on a desert aesthetic; with aspects like needing to keep water in mind, the different resources available (and the ones protected within town), and sandstorms, sandrock feels both like its own game and like a worthy sequel. you don't have to have played portia to enjoy this game, either, as it stands alone very well.

i appreciate that the team working on this game has taken feedback into account. sometimes the audio balancing was a bit off, and certain things were too loud (sorry for avoiding you for so long, sandy!), but after the most recent update those seem to have been pretty much fixed.

one of my favorite things to do while i'm relaxing is to play this game while showing it to my friend. we love the pacing of this game, always having enough to do but not feeling overwhelmed. i appreciate being able to adjust the speed of the passage of time, so we can get all the things done that we want to in a day.

the game is also quite beautiful. i like to bring the in-game camera to various scenes to take pictures and hang them up in my character's house. anyways, this long and rambling review can be summed up by: thank you for making this game! it's by far one of my favorites.",2733

2023-11-13,"it's worth the money. 6/10 rating for now

to sum it up: combat and exploration sucks, but the rest of the game is pretty good and makes up for some of it.

crafting and expanding your workshop is very fun as well as most of the campaign. relationships with the npcs is also good. the town is beautiful.

the bad part is combat, which lacks any kind of challenge and doesn't feel good. you level up your character by doing pretty much anything and this automatically increases your damage significantly. this meant that once i started the first combat oriented mission of the campaign, i was already 10 levels above the enemies and it felt very boring. aside that, i think the main issue is that combat feels very floaty and has no weight. the sound effects animations when hitting enemies are lackluster, making it feel very boring to hit enemies.

stages for exploration are very repetitive copy paste of enviroments and lack any true interesting parts or puzzles.

inventory management is also another small issue, since there's tons of different items, it gets hard to organize them all, specially playing on controller.

overall it's a pretty decent game, with much potential if they fix combat and level scaling.

2023-11-14,"let's just get the important bit out of the way first: this is my 2023 game of the year. it was only a matter of when the game would come out of early access to claim its crown.

now then, on to why this game is, as of this writing, my 6th most-played title in terms of hours on my steam account.

it's basically everything from my time at portia, but improved upon and made better in every possible way. the world is bigger, the building mechanics refined to a visible-from-space shine, the action rpg story fleshed out in a way that makes it the primary driver of gameplay rather than purely a framing device.

indeed, this is less a cozy game with action-rpg elements and more a reimagining of the action rpg formula where cozy game mechanics are the primary driver of progression. the genres blend seamlessly in a way that they never have before—looking at you, horizon zero dawn and forbidden west and every ubisoft game, where the crafting is tedious and feels unnecessary.

but at the same time, this game also has a cozy soul. if you're played any harvest moon-like, the life sim elements are exactly what you want them to be and then some. building relationships with villagers, romance, family life, it's all there with plenty of choices and some remarkably well-written relationship and character backstory dialogue. there are just so many ways to get a villager's friendship up compared to, say, stardew valley's more traditional talk-and-gift approach, and with the anti-frustration feature of not having to talk to every villager every day just to keep their relationship level from backsliding.

speaking of anti-frustration features, there are plenty more in this game as well. none of the main story quests are timed; complete them at your leisure. get overleveled if the combat's not your strong suit. rush the main story quests to unlock more of the crafting recipes if that's your jam. speedrunners and challenge runners? go to town, the game's got plenty of measurable ways to keep score. 

almost none of the sidequests are timed. if you unlock them too fast, as happens when you're powering through the main quest and hitting every character's sidequest trigger faster than you can bang them out, well, take a step back and take your time. the devs listened to players during the early access stage of the process and took the most common frustration—players felt rushed—out of the game. you want to complete them as fast as possible, nothing's stopping you. but it all fits in with the overarching theme of well-camouflaged accessibility that never feels like it's being dumbed down.

as for the action and combat in the action rpg, well, the devs know they're not from software. this isn't going to challenge anyone with a firm grounding in action games. you can overpower just about anything in the game because the devs have consciously avoided the bethesda syndrome of level-scaling enemies. well, with one exception—going too far afield in a sandstorm is going to surprise you the first time you run into high-level versions of basic enemies—but even that is a smart stylistic choice that makes sandstorms feel appropriately dangerous and threatening for a game set against the backdrop of a desert environment with a strong ""green aesop"" running through the main story.

is the game perfect? well, no, no game is perfect, not even games that are otherwise among the greatest of all time (i say this as someone who loved everything about red dead redemption 2 except for the on-rails quest design, for example.)

for one thing, the fishing minigame is one of the weakest i've seen in this genre. it's simplistic and repetitive and offers almost no challenge and very little reason to even engage with it beyond a couple of cooking recipes. this is a shame, especially since portia's fishing minigame was quite fun and other games like stardew, animal crossing (and dinkum, which cribs heavily from it), and even red dead 2 have great outdoorsman-style fishing gameplay.

in addition, there are a couple of dungeons in the midgame that have a jarring tonal shift toward platformer gameplay. thankfully the devs refined it a bit after its initial introduction; jumps are more forgiving, there's plenty of ""coyote time"" with ledges, and there's the option to skip the trickiest segments if you fail them enough times, but for a game that otherwise has good dungeon design, there's a heavy ""why, devs?"" when playing the two dungeons in question.

but those are minor quibbles in a game that is otherwise the absolute apex of the cozy game genre with one heck of a story rpg to go with it.

absolutely, by miles, my 2023 game of the year. 10/10.",12878
2023-11-13,"i have no prior experience with portia. to me, they do a good job implementing elements from other farming/life sims: harvest moon, stardew valley, animal crossing, etc; while keeping its own identity. neatly packaged into one big sandrock. one of those games you can catch yourself accidentally spending hours on. those r rare, dude, thanx for that :d

on another note, do not rely on auto saving x_x",14098
2023-11-13,"if not just all the fun the game gives me, i have to say, what an amazing voicing cast. i lose each one of them. so well represented with their characters. looking forward to more updates.",14098
2023-11-13,very good game. i would recommend it.,14098
2023-11-13,"my time at sandrock has, so far, been a worthy sequel to my time at portia. if you're a fan of life-sims like harvest moon, rune factory or stardew valley, there's likely to be something here for you. 

panthea really stepped up their game on this one. actions feel so much more impactful and fluid than in portia. i have not completed the main storyline so far (77 hours in!) but i have really enjoyed how dynamic the characters and stories have been! 

i'd like to draw particular attention to the voice acting. while there are a few clunkers, no offense to them, the majority of the voice actors really hit it out of the park! similarly, the writing really rose to the occasion in this one. they'll occasionally reference memes or movies in their lines and i normally find that a little cringe but it happens sporadically enough that i find it endearing here. 

finally, if it means to anyone who has read this far, i seldomly review games here on steam. the ones i do are ones i really enjoyed! that means a whole lot right there.",14098

2023-11-13,"this game is just ..... wow! other game developers, please take notes. this is how you make a game. its better than stardew valley. it has literally everthing.  buy this game. i swear you wont regret it. if have the money purchase it. it is worth every penny.",14098

2023-11-13,amazing game that improves upon the formula of the previous game in every way,14098
2023-11-13,"really good game, did not expect such a wonderful multiplayer experience. there were minor problems with inventory management, and the crafting timers get a little too long late game, but overall i really enjoyed this!",14098
2023-11-14,"pretty full synopsis, no spoilers... except for the stupid actor part... which doesn't really spoil anything... it's the equivalent of saying, ""guy walks outside"" oh my gosh... he really did walk outside! spoilersss. i'm confident it wouldn't be the thing that kept me out of heaven by saying no spoilers...

if you liked my time at portia, you'll like this one. the controls are  basically the same with some minor differences that take getting used to. key difference i find amazing is that your storage is linked to your inventory when building, as well as most cases when giving gifts or completing quests. i found one instance where i couldn't give something in my storage and it's probably a bug. if a developer ever reads this, it was when one of the npc's was craving a ""copper plate"" i had to have it physically on me to give in that case... or maybe i'm dumb and haven't realized that all gifts must be in inventory to give and that's just a feature. in other words you don't need to spend hours organizing your storage... just throw it in and call it a day (except for clothes you want to keep... that's worth putting in it's own storage... everything else? who cares?)

relic hunting... is more exciting... maybe some won't like the change but i especially love it. instead of a giant cube room it's multiple floors of some building or something, and there are specific items you can get per floor. it makes it less of a ""find one of 50 relics which each have 2-7 pieces in this one giant room! didn't find them? well then do it all over again!"" now it's more like 5 relics per floor in a designed building that has multiple floors and start from whichever floor you want so long as you've gone deep enough to find the entrance to that floor. huge improvement in my book.

combat... i can't say about all the weapons... i started with the daggers tried, the others once, i love the daggers.... call me thorfin. 

combat is pretty similar to the old game, but just better. from armor breaking/staggering, to varying stats on the same item because of it's quality, which can range from low, to perfect, and then there's rare, which adds some cool features.... whether it's crafting, buying or finding. the items are all much more exciting in this game.

i was disappointed.... that everything feels mostly the same as the original game, but happy it's better. you're basically getting the same game but part two. 

the dialogue is mostly skipable, with the occasional choose your response, in which cases i regret not reading the dialogue... buuuut 95% of the time... totally skipable. unless i'm in a reading mood, i find it average, and occasionally good.

cut scenes.... are extremely lacking... it's like a low quality first time actor playing a major roll in a lead film, and the director says after each scene, ""cut.. that's a wrap... send it to production."" when they should've said, ""cut! that sucks! what are you doing! you're entering a scene where all the monsters are already gone, you've just barely shown up, and then you do a front roll into the room... from the middle of the room... you then aim your pistol, stand up, smile doing a finger spin with the pistol... catch it, blow the smoke off the tip of the pistol, when there is no smoke, because you haven't fired a single shot?... are you stupid? did you take acting lessons from stupid school? did you graduate top of your stupid class with stupid honors? because that was pretty stupid!""

now if they added a character to come in and say those exact words to that silly dude who did all those things... then it would've been hilarious, and we all would've understood... that's the stupid guy... but no, every cut scene is pretty much like that.

i love the game... plenty to make fun of, and critique, but that doesn't stop me from loving it. leave a comment/question if you have any specific inquiries.

dlc worth it?..... you aren't missing anything by not buying any of the dlc items... sure they'll give you a nice head start, but even though i had them i found myself not using any of them because i like starting a game with nothing and then building up to something awesome. if you're the same, save yourself a few bucks, otherwise if you just want some gear for some different looks, then maybe you'll like it.

character creation.... well at least you won't look like you have down syndrome in the game... unless that's what you're going for i'm sure you can pull it off!!! there is a major improvement on the quality of character in the creation tab... but i just want more!!! 

you really don't have a lot of options, and they don't leave you thinking, ""that character i made looks so bad a!!!"" it's more of a, ""well... i guess that's as good as it gets."" i liked how mine turned out, but it took 3 hours of messing around with every possibility, starting and deleting 3 games (the character never looks exactly the same in the game play)...before i finally got to ""my guy looks really kind of okay!""

(example... i put lipstic and changed the coloring on my guy to make him look like he had actual lips... not feminine lips... just dude lips... i get into the game... feminine af! deleted, and then did the same thing except made the lipstick lighter than what looked good... in the gameplay it looked pretty good. i mean.....i'm the equivalent of brad freaking pitt in this character creation screen! i look so good! kindof... joking aside i was happy with the final result. i can't say whether it's the same for making a girl since i didn't try.)

happy building ;).",12878
2023-11-13,"i love this game so much :d it surely improved a lot since my time in portia. not to mention that some event is even connected to the previous game, like how ginger leave portia to head to sandrock to be cured, and sandrock is not the only place invaded by the duvos'. there are many majors coming from different places which i believe may be the place for the next game in the seri my time at :3 my guess is ethea since it got mention many times, and seem to face the similar issues like sandrock, so i think there is a chance.
i also love the romancing stuff, there are events to upgrade relationship without giving them the necessary item, except for the proposing, of course. i just enjoying those dialogue and the cut scene.",14098
2023-11-13,"in the last week i've played this game for 80 hours. so i like it. just a a little.
my sister bought me this since she'd played the beta. normally i'm not the most excited to play life sims with farming in it because the market is oversaturated with samey, boring games that wish they could be like stardew valley.
instead, i got a game where i don't have to farm if i don't want to (except for some quests but. no daily watering anyway, so that's dope). the story itself has been super enjoyable, and fun. i didn't think it'd ramp up like it did, but serious, emotional moments would pop up out of nowhere, and it felt like such a treat. i can do basically anything, and at my own pace. there's very little the game stopped me from doing that wasn't story related. it's fun to have all the options in the world, and have none of them be a bad on.
sandrock has easily become one of my favorite games, and i hope there's more like it and portia in the future.",14098

2023-11-13,"a fun, relaxing, quirky game that scratches all the right itches of this type of genre, while at the same time being unrefined, not at all challenging, and laughably cheesy. 

h o w e v e r - seriously yall, some of the bugs, mistakes, glitches and quirks in this game are just so bad and look like really easy fixes. 
- tree art has meshes that don't line up where it would appear ""chopped"" at the trunk. 
- the voice acting is either fantastic, or fantastically bad. if the actors have really thick native accents, don't tell them to sound country! it doesn't work! just have them speak in their native accent, it sounds fine and doesn't break immersion in a post calamity fantasy world. 
- do one more quality pass over your writing and dialogue, possibly with a native english speaker. there's some easy mistakes in the text/speech that can cause a lot of confusion. 
- fix the pop-in of assets! even if you have to force another second of load time for the player. i've gotten stuck in things that haven't appeared yet - especially on holidays. 
- don't automatically have the player start chopping a tree that they shouldn't be chopping! i don't want to be punished in game for doing something that i didn't mean to do in the first place. 
- allow calendar reminders for npc birthdays. 
- more sandstorms! they should damage shops and buildings, allowing for the builder to take on special commissions to repair them for temporary discounts. 
- warn players further in advance that quests are going to expire... 
- not everyone should get along. perhaps consider in the future that becoming friends with some people, means making enemies of others. make the relationship meters less linear. put more hints into the game to help the player know what gifts npc's love. i don't want to have to google this stuff! 
- more quests for the animals! 
-whoever comes up with your monsters (honey pot ant, rocket rooster, etc) deserves a raise.",14098
2023-11-13,"i absolutely adore this game. i played the one before it, my time at portia and fell in love with that slice of life game, but this one has definitely took my number one spot.

the game is a blast, there's ruin diving, farming, workshop building, you can build your own house, can build a stable for your mounts, a barn for your farm animals, etc.

i haven't had a game give me such a breath of fresh air in a minute, and this one has been an absolute treat getting into. the character dialogue, relationships and backstories of all characters are so much improved than in my time at portia, it really feels like the devs not only built upon their previous title but still kept their heart on their sleeves while making this one. i'm currently 50 hours into a new game with no sign of finishing anywhere near soon, as i love to take everything slow and explore to my hearts content. now, there is some jank, it feels like the combat, while improved from my time at portia still plays fast and loose. sometimes it feels a little too spammy and other time it feels like you have a bullet sponge boss. also, my lock on is a bit fickle to say the least. but for any jank i mentioned there's a labor of love behind all of it.

i cannot wait for what the pathea game developers work on in the future with sandrock and other titles, they have definitely made me a fan of their work(s)!

",14098
2023-11-12,"i recommend it but it has a lot of flaws.
clunky cinematics, npc teleporting themselves out of scenery. after 50 hours playtime the game started lagging, the time was slowed and every animation was delayed and 5/6/7 seconds longer than usual. very put me out of it when it happen unfortunately. (restarting the game doesn't really work, skipping day or sometime going in and out of an interior can work)

the storyline is.. surprising for this type of game but cool overall. the 2/3rd of the game was pretty smooth with quest almost everyday guiding you and providing you goals to go forward. 
when you've done almost all side content, the game consist of sleeping to trigger main events. (after 70h+ for me.) so i'm starting to get tired of it even tho' i have still a few things to do.

the game can be really immersive if you're into this kind of game. socializing and housing is nice. 
still wasn't able to romance the character of my choice after 120h playtime. i don't know why but the person was constantly refusing the necklace even tho the npc is indicated as a possible bachelor. since the character is used in main story, maybe it'll change in a few in-game days. 
i played a few of portia but here i felt more guided (in a good way). main mission in portia was like : firstly build a bus stop, then go upgrade all your workshop and tools then go build the bridge. 
here it's more build this, then this but it need a new ressource that you can find here, and that allows you to start upgrading gears and workshop without it to be instantly needed to continue. making you feel like you're the one choosing to upgrade stuff to go faster, provide new things etc.

i backed the game and played a few during alphas and betas so i'm a little disappointed to feel like the game is unpolished at this state.

i don't know if i'll come back to this game but still, it kept me busy for 125hours so it made its part of entertaining me.",18838
2023-11-12,"in other farming games, i worry about progressing through the quests too fast. in this game, as in my time at portia before it, i know the quests will just keep coming and coming and coming. so much content, funny characters, and a serious upgrade to the inventory system that makes everything more convenient. 

what elevates this series above others for me is gradually being able to see the huge changes you make to the land and town. see that bridge/tower/mill etc.? i built that! i fixed that problem, and now i see it every time i ride past.",18838
2023-11-12,"i honestly love this game. i really enjoyed my time at portia, but i feel that my time at sandrock amplified all the good things and built a rock solid game. i feel that the story progression is very fluid and i never feel like i have too much down time. the townsfolk have a lot of personality, the quests are engaging, and i feel like the mining system is more enjoyable. i haven't participated in the multiplayer option yet, but i don't think that they should deter you from playing the game on your own since there is so much to do in the single player mode!",18838

2023-11-12,"for the first few hours i was kind of iffy on this game. i love the stardew genre of games though and the initial grid didn't deter me. i'm now 78 hours in and i can safely say this game is an absolute gem. it has everything you'd expect in a game like this, tool progression, a passable combat system, a modest tech tree and progressive efficiency gains, but there are a few things that put it above the rest of the competition within this genre.

1. inventory management is an absolute breeze. when crafting and turning in quests you have access to every item in every chest that you own. furthermore, when you go to any chest in your base to deposit items after a day of gathering, you can press a single button to automatically deposit all like-items into stacks across all of your chests. this game has completely solved the inventory management issue that bogs down mid and late-game in this genre and for that i tip my hat.

2. the writing in this game is phenomenal! the story is pretty bonkers and while being pretty cutesy and family friendly, crams in a lot of humor and some genuinely wild twists and turns. this game isn't high-drama, but it's just so much fun that i can't recommend it enough. the characters are also very well-written and unique.

3. the art design for this game is very unique and i think it'll age fairly well. the customization options you get on your character are pretty fun. i like seeing what other people made their avatars to look like. you also get an outfit tab separate from your equipment tab so you have total freedom to customize your look.

so all that said, there are a few cons that whittle this game down from being perfect to being in the 9/10 bracket.

1. the map is fairly limited in size. you'll spend a lot of time going back and forth through the same areas for dozens of hours.

2. the game is pretty grindy if you're looking to upgrade your farm to the largest possible size. it requires an absolutely diabolical amount of money and there aren't a lot of ways to make said money as easily as you can in stardew valley. there's a barn and coop structure that you can build, but they aren't very good revenue sources; the same can be said about farming. the real way to make money in this game is to fulfill a limited amount of crafting requests each day and then just grind the mines over and over. i wish there were more options for money making or that the farm plot upgrades were cheaper.

overall i really like this game and recommend it strongly if you're a fan of this genre. grit your teeth through the slow start and then enjoy yourself for literal days.",18838
2023-11-12,"*multiplayer review*

i only played a small amount of the single player version before jumping into multiplayer with my wife.  the big difference i noticed right off was that you have to build & populate the town in multiplayer while most of the towns buildings & populous are already there in single.

while it's a really fun game in multiplayer, it is very much a grind.  it took the 2 of us around 60 hours to get every building built & upgraded so if you find grind tedious, this might not be the game for you.  i found the grind tolerable because it's mixed in with other content such as dungeons, farming, caring for pets & mounts, crafting, exploring, events, house/workshop building and story line.  the best feature of multiplayer is that when you set up a multiplayer game, it's just like renting your own server except it costs you nothing.  you can have the game match you with other players or start a new town and chose to let randoms in or set it to invite only.  when you have players join, unlike many other game, you do not have to be online for them to log in and play.  for the amount of play time and content you'll get out of this game, i think the price tag is a fare price but that will be up to you to determine.  if you don't mine the grind, i recommend this game so watch some gameplay or trailers and see if it's for you.",18838
2023-11-12,"i haven't played my time at portia, but i love this game. the grind sets in fairly early but if you like looter/crafting/grinding then this game is for you.

2023-11-12,the game is fun and has a good flow to it. love that you can fight in the open world and not just only in caves. you do have to grind for what you what but that's that point of this kind of game. the only thing that i would change about the game is to make it to where you have to craft a bigger bag rather then pay for one extra slot at a time but. but still 10 out of 10.,18838

2023-11-12,"my time at sandrock is an amazing sequel to my time at portia. it improves on most parts while only keeping a few weaknesses it's predecessor had. to keep it short:

+runs better
+no more inventory management (your machines automatically use items from your chests, and you can scroll through all chests at once), but it still keeps the inventory when gifting items/donating to the museum (why though? please fix this)
+an interesting story (it's nothing groundbreaking, but it keeps you hooked), however the story has 2 plotlines and the 2nd one keeps dragging on for just a bit too long imo (if the pacing was improved, a solid 10 hours of gametime could be cut, which would fix this imo)
+improved overall gameplay (combat is better, mines are now actually designed instead of randomly generated, big enemy variety, several weapon options)
+better cast (i disliked it more in the first few hours, but the more time i put into it, the more i grew to prefer it over the first cast), additionally, the game doesnt shy from adding or taking away characters halfway through the story, keeping the cast fresh
+improved farming, improved pet keeping, improved mount-system and unlockable options to modify your house and workshop from home (no more running to the upgrade-store)

~new building system for housing. originally i liked it a lot, but its very shallow. the lack of options to build as well as the lack of forms for building really put a dent into this for me (no triangles, round houses etc.) and the factory and greenhouse also got worked into this and are now basically quadratic blocks with little to no customization, so they look worse like the old versions but also dont improve on them gameplaywise.
~bigger focus on socializing - the game has a lot of small quests which tell you stories about the individual characters, their relationships with each others and their backstories. i put it in mixed because some people prefer the core gameplay loop, but if you enjoy the social-part, this puts games like sdv in the dust
~bigger focus on combat and platforming - i mentioned earlier that sandrock improved on combat. however, it's still not good. you can work with it, it does what it has to do, but thats it. and focusing a big part of the story on the workable combat and clunky platforming simply doesnt work and is frustrating. personally, those were the most dreadful parts, despite the devs working some of the best ideas into them.

-all those nitpicks i had lead to me feeling like the game was simply not quite finished. it reminded me a lot of baldurs gate 3, where the start was so well thought through and everything worked perfectly but as you got into the later parts of the game it starts to feel as if they didnt work it through enough.
-same goes for performance. the game runs overall a lot better than portia, but as you get into the later parts of the game, you get more bugs, such as textures not loading, small lagspikes and characters not working or completely disappearing.

overall i give sandrock a 7/10. if they fix the bugs and improve on the factory and greenhouse the game can easily become an 8-9/10 and one of the strongest condenders in the genre, next to stardew valley.",18838
2023-11-12,"highly recommend, this game rivals my all time favorite stardew valley. similar mechanics and foundation to my time at portia, but vastly improved graphics and play-ability. i have found all the characters interesting and fun to talk to, missions engaging and thoughtful, and gameplay smooth and cohesive.

i've had this game since christmas last year (so most of my hours were in early access) and the game has only been improved with full release. when i came across a game breaking bug in the afternoon, it was fixed by the next morning. pathea has outdone themselves. i have something like 280 hours played (230 hours on my main file) and am close to completing the main story, but not quite there yet.

i love time sink games like this and the only con i can think of is that sometimes it takes a while to load a new area (exiting the house, going into a dungeon, etc). my understanding is this is going to be further optimized in the future so i have no complaints about this game and can't wait to spend many more hours on it! 10/10 with lots of love",18838
2023-11-12,"i played my time at portia before this and loved it. initially when sandrock was announced, i wasn't excited about playing in the desert. i decided to give it a go anyway because of how much i loved portia. to my surprise, my time at sandrock far surpasses my time at portia. from the story depth, backgrounds of every character, storage, ruin diving, map size, amount of quests, the existence of logan, voice acting, graphics of course and just overall day to day. there is always something to do in sandrock. just for reference, i put 146 hours into my time at portia. i've played 253 hours of my time at sandrock, i'm almost finished with the main story and plan on replaying just to explore all the marriage candidates. 

kudos to the devs for creating such a story rich, beautiful game. they are also amazing at fixing bugs. i spent half of my time playing before full release and picked it back up once it was fully released. it's abundantly clear they care about this game and the players. i can not wait to see what they have in store for us in the future with project me!!!",18838
2023-11-12,"overall good game. its odd when i hit rock and the ore floats above it, making it difficult to hit and pinpoint with my pickax in the mines at time. the cut scenes can also take an awkward moment to start as the npc sometimes walks around a bit.

2023-11-12,"[h1] my time at sandrock: an amazingly massive game, a great story line, and some occasional faults. ~ [/h1]

[h3] okay, so i have obviously played this game a lot, and it's because it is that good! if you're a return player from portia, i can confirm to you that sandrock is a massive upgrade in almost all aspects! if you have never played a game in the my time at series, don't worry! you absolutely do not have to play portia to enjoy sandrock! after over 200 hours of game play, here's my major takeaways ~ [/h3]

[u] the great ~ [/u] 

[b] the story line [/b]
- sandrock has a really great main story quest line, with enough twist and turns to keep you interested and immersed. it truly was a pleasure to play through it! there's a good mix of resource gathering, social aspects, combat, farming, and advancement required that keeps you motivated to continue grinding towards completion. also, if you're a return player from portia, i personally believe that sandrock has a better story line, and has increased difficulty.
[b] the characters [/b]
- wow! sandrock truly has some very colorful characters! without giving anything away, these side characters have a variety of personalities that are genuinely fun to interact with. in a lot of other games from this genre i tend to stop talking to a lot of the npcs around town, but i actually like hearing what the characters in sandrock have to say! it also helps that every character is given new unique dialogue after progress in the story is made, so they're not just constantly spouting the same lines all the time, regardless of development. there's a lot of great romance options as well, with there being someone for everyone. 
[b] the dialogue [/b]
- there's no other way to say this ~ this game just has straight up hilarious lines! from a farmer who's a part-time conspiracy theorist to a rock obsessed wannabe deputy, there's no shortage of great lines from the characters around the game. the dialogue also makes you want to befriend more of the citizens to see their extra events because of how hilarious they can be. your player character can even give some golden one-liners as the game progresses! 
[b] the grind [/b] 
- you really have to get involved in all aspects of the game when playing. you're going to need a lot of wood to complete projects, i mean, you are a builder. however, sandrock is desolate and cutting down trees and cacti is a big no-no. this means you have to cut down tiny bushes, dead logs, etc. which do not give you a lot of resources, meaning you've got to keep at the grind! also, as you unlock more areas and more of the story, you find yourself having to go back to previous ruins/areas in order to get different types of materials, as they're not in the same place. don't forget that water powers all of your machines, so you have to keep your tank full in the middle of the desert! 

[u] the lacking~ [/u]

[b] the family issue [/b]
- in short, because there's so many elements in sandrock, they eventually fizzle out in unsatisfactory ways. a good example can be seen with married and family life, which is just not fleshed out enough. considering characters around the game continuously sing praises towards your character, and comment on the various things going on around, it's strange that basically nobody acknowledges your spouse and children. so far, there's no family events, and once your children exit the baby stage, you literally never see them interact with anyone, including your spouse. they wake up and essentially go to one place (the train station) for the entire day.  it would've been nice to have them as actual members of the town, with their own events as they age, and a routine that mimics other npcs. as for your spouse, the married events currently in game are very boring and out of place for some characters. i would really love to see married life and family life be more fleshed out in the future, whether in another my time game, or in an expansion/update! i would rather have less romance options and just one child if that means that the additional content that comes with them would be stronger. 
[b] character favoritism + strange depth [/b]
- it's very obvious that, because of fan reception, some characters are more favored than others. by this i mean that they have way more content. take fang and logan as an example. both characters are fan favorites, and they have some really cool events! these events also work really well with what has been presented with their characters, which gives not only their characters, but the game, more depth. it really makes you believe that they had a life before you, and have a life despite you. i suppose this makes me more critical of the other characters in the game. director qi is a good example of this. you actually get to know so much about his character! for example, he's the grandson of a successful scientist who appears to be very strict, his parent's had more ""lowly"" jobs in comparison and qi appears to sort of look down on them, and he even states that his parents were shocked to find out that you exist (if you romance him), and that when he was younger he calculated that there was only a 3.14% chance of him finding love. these all combine to create such an interesting character, and gives you a plethora of ideas of how his character will/can progress. however, despite these tidbits that you can gather, that's basically it. his character, as well as a large portion of characters in the game, plateau. this is what i mean about strange depth, it's like they had more planned for certain characters, and it just never came to fruition. i was so certain when romancing qi's character that there was going to be some really cool events regarding his past, him falling in love with you, having children of his own, etc., and it just never happened. it honestly was a big disappointment because i saw all the makings of a great side story for a lot of the romance-able characters, but it's just not there. 

[h3] in conclusion, i honestly feel like i have so much more to say, which isn't surprising considering how much i loved the game. additionally, i would say that because i love the game and series so much i am probably more critical of it in certain ways! i think that's truly the hallmark sign of a great game, liking it so much that you want to make certain changes to perfect it! all in all, sandrock was truly an amazing experience and i would recommend it to all lovers of the genre. however, keep in mind that there are going to be aspects of the game that will leave you frustrated. these frustrations, at least for me, have a lot to do with the fact that i just want more! keep it up devs! you're doing great sweeties, and the improvement from portia is massive! [/h3]",18838
2023-11-11,so slay,18231
2023-11-10,"i would highly recommend this lovely game! received the early access as a birthday gift! games like these i love. though i had to reduce everything to lowest quality in the options because of my internet issues and pc being old in tech standards. low or high quality graphics, still love it.",15092

2023-11-10,fun,15092
2023-11-11,"overall, i recommend the game - 480 hours played across early release - but that doesn't mean the game is perfect. much has been made of the voiceover issues with this game, so i'll bypass those, other than to add that changing the voiceover artist for later updates compounded the issue.

it's less clunky (although arguable less realistic, as a consequence) than its predecessor, my time at portia, which may make for a less than satisfying experience for anyone who chooses to play that game after this one. the characters in sandrock are less bobble-headed, too, which is an improvement. portia and sandrock happen in a simultaneous timelime, which leads to some quietly-amusing references to, effectively, your portia character at points during sandrock, another reason to consider playing portia first.

of the five bachelors i romanced, three of them exhibited behaviour that, in real life, should set major alarm bells ringing, which is quite concerning. a couple of the npcs are genuinely unlikeable, which is fine and reflective of real life; but i found myself resenting completing lucrative contracts for one of them by late game, as their relationship with me continued to increase even as my loathing of them grew.

as i did play this through early release, some things may have changed by full release, but a few niggly annoyances stood out: at times, lucrative commissions for machinery would appear on the commission board; but without having any in-game ability to know what was required to complete construction, it was quite frustrating to accept these commissions, research the manufacturing plans, discover you needed more advanced equipment yourself, research that, then find that you needed components you either didn't have materials for, or didn't have the ability to make. in one instance, the 'base' instructions for making the refined material i needed to make one component didn't even become available until nearly two months after i'd failed the commission. if the capacity to complete the commission doesn't exist, don't make it available.

secondly, there were times when it became impossible to complete tasks because the final act clashed with some other event. some of these may have since been resolved. in a related annoyance, there are times when the pc wakes up with awareness of events it is literally impossible for them to have any knowledge of. often this is minor: calendar events added on rising in the morning that are explained when mail is read. occasionally, however, these are quite significant. just as bed, there are some events involving npcs that clearly acknowledge the passage of a significant period of time (a minimum two weeks would be essential in one case), yet those events conclude within a day or so. then there is the issue of being 'transported' to major events when you get up. on one occasion, running back home after such an event, i encountered a minor task simply by talking with an npc that i had no means of answering because the task was outlined in a letter i hadn't yet had a chance to read. more concerningly, the non-committal answer i gave may have broken the character, who never moved from the spot i encountered him for the remainder of the game, unless needed elsewhere.

the nanny-nag that says ""you can't use that possibly rude word!"" when naming things in single-player is both ludicrous and offensive: i'm an adult, not six years old, and i can make my own decisions. if it's important that any vaguely-implied rudeness must be leapt on with extreme prejudice, then i would suggest that eliminating toxic behaviours from a multitude of npcs would be a better use of censorship - especially if (and i am forced to assume that this must be the case) the game makers are trying to avoid corrupting sweet childish innocence.

similarly, an in-game swimwear fashion show basically designed to sell dlcs is both sexist and cowardly in dressing the female models in bikins and the males in shorts. the game designers may have jumped on the 'it's okay to be gay"" bandwagon; but their moral code is severely lacking in other areas (most particularly regarding toxic behaviours).

one in-game shop has a link to actual character figurines on amazon: if you follow the link you find that you're being asked to pay an offensively-large amount of money for a blind-box figurine, so that's a definitive 'no' on both counts. still, that annoyance is easily-avoided, although it does make me less-inclined to consider buying other pathea games products, up to and including dlcs, so they may like to rethink their approach.

yes, i have concentrated on the negatives in this review. on the positive side, the game is immensely-playable. for an obsessive such as me, there is always something to do, with the essential wait-times scattered throughout the game usually not too much of a trial. some npcs are clearly on the autism spectrum, and this is treated respectfully (albeit occasionally with not-unreasonable impatience) by other npcs and player choices, which is to be commended. apart from some built-in sexism, the character design is generally appealing, and the capacity to 'hide the hat' via the settings is appreciated: having put a lot of effort into designing my character, i like being able to see them. the storylines are often engaging, although i wish the character-based relationship-building tasks had a time expiry if unselected, because having them sit constantly on the map when i have no interest in following them through is annoying.

in summary, an enjoyable, very playable game with a number of flaws, some of them significant.",18231

2023-11-11,"do not buy, extremely buggy game.

i really enjoyed my time at portia (mtap), and found that sandrock (mtas) has extended much of the gameplay. the interaction system is fine, and the crafting system is basically identical. most of the game is good (hence my recent post-release play of ~90 hours (~20hrs was during the beta)). the fishing is so much better in mtas, it's a great improvement.

however, as the game goes on, more and more bugs arise. i've found that the game starts to chug after long play sessions (5+hrs) and needs to be restarted just to transition between scenes more smoothly. i've had several days where the game just hangs because when you leave your house in the morning it's supposed to cut to a cutscene, but the cutscene doesn't start, and so the game just sits on a black screen. sometimes restarting the game helped, otherwise i had to restart my computer (this indicates that mtas isn't releasing resources it finished using).

on the non-bugs front: the dialogue is often just bad. while i don't mean characters like unsuur who are just intentionally odd (and pretty funny), the entire bronco the kid arc is just immensely painful to play through. i appreciate that this was probably attempting to be silly, it's just a conversation that actual humans would never have with each other.

there are a lot of ""popins"" = graphics that just 'pop' into existence, but should have been there beforehand. exiting a building (eg the museum) leaves you standing outside an empty lot until the game loads in the building. this is not a modern fps, a quick look at the sceenshots will quickly show that the graphics in this game are very basic, no dlss in sight. yet buildings (and people) are often loaded in very slowly, taking 2-3 seconds to fully load each time you fast travel. this seems small until you realise that you will be fast travelling multiple times per day, every day, so this issue is constantly in your face.

npcs don't exist in the world. or rather, they do until they need to be somewhere else, and then they teleport. one of the things that i enjoyed in mtap was watching the townsfolk sprint across town to get to a gathering. in addition to being fun to watch, it also meant you could intercept them during their schedule to interact with them. this largely doesn't happen any more, they're simply teleported to where they need to be. this, frankly, is just absolute garbage, and leads to a bunch of issues.

an example: heidi and i are married in the game, and i have a quest to give her an item. according to my map, she's at the game centre, so i hop on my horse and head over there. as i approach the games centre, the quest marker jumps back to my workshop: she's there to pick up all the completed items from my machine. so i turnaround and head back to my workshop. as i pass the train station, the quest marker jumps *back* to the game centre: heidi finished her workshop tasks, and her schedule has her at the games centre so she teleports again.

in mtap, i would have met heidi on her way, but in mtas it's impossible.

in addition to that, npcs will just randomly teleport around. if you hang around the main square in front of the town hall, justice and trudy will just randomly materialise there. this is an entirely reasonable thing to do if npcs get stuck on objects, but 1) it's happening all the goddamn time, and 2) coco gets stuck on objects in my workshop all the time, yet never teleports.

this is before we talk about a game-breaking bug that has halted my current play. two events were supposed to occur on two different days, but the first didn't trigger on the correct day, so now they've both blended and are happening at the same time. this has caused the game to lose its sh~t, and spin my camera out into the desert, where it just sits and ignores all input from me.

all in all, this game is riddled with bugs, and has serious foundational flaws in its design. i bought this game in early access on the strength of mtap, and (frankly) i regret doing so.

edited to respond to dev comment: it *is* installed on an ssd. you seem to be saying that it's even worse on an hdd.....",18231
2023-11-11,"this is a review on the multiplayer side of the game. i never tried the single player mode.
solid game. surprisingly large amount of content and good quality throughout. 

quest done almost always add value to your gameplay and town and not just a exp/gold farm like what quest in games usually do. grinding doesnt feel like a chore as you are rewarded well for it. as for how much things there is to do in the game, the only answer is yes. after 30hrs in, i still never run out of things to do, super addicting. 

combat is fairly simple and suit a game like this, where building and developing your town is the main goal. dungeons are pretty fun to go through, the bosses have mechanics and not just a mob with large hp pool which was surprising as well. however, most fights is just a stat fight (whether you have enough stats/heals), dodging doesnt feel that important in the game and it doesnt even feel rewarding to dodge attacks as you can just tank through everything anyways with enough stats and heals and kill the mob faster. however, it is understandable as it is a rather casual friendly game. however if the devs decide to make the combat more interactive rather than a stat fight in the future, i am all for it. also guns are fun and all, needing to use ads to shoot is not fantastic.

last and the biggest selling point for me, dedicated servers. it makes it easy to have friends play in the same town anytime as everyone has their own lifes and can play at different timings. unlike many of the sandbox games that only supports p2p as default.",18231
2023-11-11,"while i'm having a great time with it, and in many ways it's an upgrade over portia, i cannot in good conscience reccommend the game in it's current state. 

bugs, technical issues and performance issues are everywhere, despite claiming to be a full release after an early access period. 

teleporting / weirdly moving characters, duplicating items, invisible walls with no explanation, non functional area transitions, extremely slow asset loading (why does a game with <5% of the complexity have massive pop in issues compared to something like cyberpunk on a good ssd?), overlapping timed events, tooltips that are straight up wrong (why does upgrading my crafting table to level 3 say i'm going to unlock copper pots when i've been able to make those all along?), events on a fixed time line happening out of order, items you're meant to interact with going invisible, quests referencing things you haven't unlocked yet, weapons being extremely poorly balanced, crafting system loosing track of what you need to make and when (the quick crafting option would be great if it didn't bug out 90% of the time by telling you to make parts for things you already have)... i could go on.

despite the ea period, the game seems to have no meaningful qa testing whatsoever, as most issues i've found would've been obvious to anyone playing for a few hours.

there is a good game under all the issues, but again, i can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone until most of these (really basic) problems are fixed.",18231
2023-11-10,?,15092
2023-11-08,lot improvement from my time at portia. i love spent my time play this game so much.,15199
2023-11-08,"this game is great! i've really enjoyed it and i'm only at 6.7 hours. id say its curing my depression, by far the best farming sim. highly recommend!",15199
2023-11-11,"having played portia, and having played this a bit while in ea, i can definitively say that this is a straight upgrade in many ways compared to the previous game and that time spent in ea was well spent to make a generally well-polished experience on release. 

the thing that stood out to me as vastly improved in comparison to portia is the combat, which, for a game that has utilized this mechanic in a more intimate way that other farming/building/life simulation games, i think really nails the good balance in necessity to being enjoyable to engage with. especially when you start upgrading the combat skills, getting more combos, getting the flow of the enemy actions and dodging and timing strikes, while not particularly profound, still feels enjoyable and far more engaging than the previous games and others in the same genre i've experienced. it feels simple enough though that even if you're not really playing this game to partake in the combat-portion of the game, it's easy enough to out-level the enemies by performing other tasks that simple button mashing to get the mats you need from lower level monsters won't pose much of an obstacle.

outside of combat, i've always enjoyed the commission system in both games, and i think it serves well here for giving yourself a sense of progression and direction. while being rewarding enough that, while being somewhat repetitive in what you'll be building for the various residents of sandrock, serves more as the foundation for pursuing other enjoyable ventures like upgrading your workshop, buying mats that you need either directly at stores or commissioning deliveries while giving you enough of a reward in not only the money you need, but additional materials and easy relationship improvements outside of the, arguably, rather shallow and repetitive npc conversational engagements quickly enough to give you variety in other things to do without feeling like too much of a grind.

the story is also rather cute, if not a bit on the simple side, which imo, is fine for what it is - it gives you a further sense of purpose and a meaningful way to progress unlockable areas, residents, and mechanics. i feel several of the npcs have notable quirks that make them memorable enough to want to engage with them and their missions, although at times, even with the characters that are not designed to be long-winded (like cooper), i found myself wanting to read the dialog faster than i wanted to hear it from them because there's just something about the way they talk and the flow that just made me frequently want to skip it. can't really put my finger on why exactly, but this was especially true when interacting with them daily during the regular chat interactions. with that said though, one really nice touch is how npcs all have their own individual reactions to story events that are enjoyable to listen to, even if they can be a bit long-winded sometimes. it's a nice touch to detail that somewhat makes your accomplishments in the game feel more relevant to your place in the world.

lastly, while i haven't played much of it since ea, the multiplayer seems way more polished (and was non-existent in the previous game) and has been pretty fun so far. if you've got friends to play with, while it's completely separate from the base instance of the game, the co-op workspace and co-op commissions and being able to engage in spelunking and combat with friends gives it a fresh feel from the base, single-player, portion of the game.

[h3][u]tl:dr[/u][/h3]
- solid improvement from the previous game in almost every way.
- combat improvements especially feel much better from previous games.
- story is fine, albeit a bit on the simple side. more focus made on the mechanics.
- many npcs are memorable in their own way if not a bit long-winded and the base chat mechanic is a bit bleh but the ""play"" mechanics make up for it a bit (albeit, get a bit repetitive with the limited options and expensive energy costs to engage in them). 
- multiplayer is a separate instance from the base, single-player, game, but having all the same mechanics being applied while playing with friends has, so far, been a very enjoyable experience and is way more polished than when it was introduced in ea.",18231
2023-11-10,"i'll come back later once i have the words to explain every thing but for now
 
this game is amazing, a little rough around the edges but leagues better than portia. like, scary how much better it is than portia!
and i dare say even, this even manage to surpass stardew valley in my heart. all the story stuff, the characters, the romance. its just so fun, it's so cozy. 

this game makes me very happy",15092
2023-11-10,"if you're a fan of stardew valley, harvest moon, rune factory or any of the similar games and are really wanting to find yourself a decent game, this one is pretty great. if you've play my time at portia, lemme just summarize and say that this... is a much better game than that one was. 

it does have the odd bug now and again, but the devs are actively listening to player feedback and are cranking out patches to fix as many issues as they can. currently multiplayer is having some issues and there are some performance issues at least when it comes to load times (especially cutscenes).

there's gathering, building, monster fighting (which is almost too ez at this time), pets, romance, events, characters with depth (for the most part), transmog for outfits, home decor/building and even children! theres a lot and apparently they're hinting at adding even more and/or fleshing more out. 

all of this and under $40? in this day and age? not too shabby!",15092
2023-11-10,"in the beginning i could only play multiplayer (which i didn't mind) because single player had a lot of lag and long loading times but, only a week after, the issue has been fixed and i can now play the game with high graphics with no issues. seeing the difference in game play between single player and multiplayer you can tell how much thought and effort they put in on making the experience fit with each game mode. in single player you have a more personal experience with the town people and in multiplayer you have big goals and dungeons you can work towards together.",15092
2023-11-10,"pathea really out did themselves on this one!  the game takes everything that was charming and fun about my time at portia and dials it up to 11.

the art style, voice acting, and dialog are charming and funny.  the crafting sim is deep enough and progresses smoothly enough to be engaging.  the overall vibe of the game is fun, relaxing and adorable.  

also, bless the developers for thinking to add an option to skip jumping puzzles after you've failed them a few times.  it's a huge accessibility feature.",15092

2023-11-10,"unfinished, in my opinion. i would describe this as ""unity jank in perpetual early access"" 

the yawning blackness within doorways feels awkward. the music's abrupt shifts between scenes and loading screens add to the awkwardness. cut scenes feature jarring transitions. the concept of the ruins is goofy, with all the intellectual stimulation of one of those archaeology sand-treasure toys for toddlers. digging dirt towards an icon and walking through black doors, hitting buttons for more icons—repeat ad nauseam. fishing is oddly implemented. the repetitive, brown environment is a monotonous downer. two resources to manage for crafting: water and fuel. why? you don't have to do much to manage either of them so i just don't even understand why it exists other than bloat. the furniture is bulky, occupying too much space without purpose. the game lacks a clear identity, failing to embody a competent farming sim, resource management game, or social game. the kids in the game all give me the creeps.

the english localization is spotty with errors that should have been fixed long ago. in-game advertisements (with grammatical errors!!) direct to external websites, including amazon pages. they also beg for reviews via in-game advertisements. the inaccurate wiki diminishes the quality of available online information.

despite these issues, i'll persist in playing because i enjoy this genre. if i hadn't known it wasn't in early access, i would have unquestioningly believed it still was. if you have ""switch store bloatware"" standards for games, you will probably be fine with this release. i neither recommend nor advise against this game. 

it should 100% be cheaper though.

p.s. i forgot to add this stupidity: when you walk into the edge of the water, the entire screen goes black and then you reappear at the edge of the water. if you walk in a second time in the same place, your character gets teleported to the center of town. i'm guessing this is because they intended to implement swimming at some point but just couldn't figure it out and so you get teleported as a failsafe to prevent your character from getting stuck. honestly, what happened to invisible walls?",15092

2023-11-10,"i love the game, i spent 35 hours on the beginning of early access and then i decided to wait for the game to be released in 1.0. after 12h in 1.0 the game as a lot of problems and it looks like it's still in the same stage as early access.

- poor optimization (i7-10700k + rtx 2080 super).
- random little loading times (loading inventory or talking to people).
- buildings that disappear and respawn after a few seconds.
- the french translation is not very good.
- multiplayer is just a sandbox with no story, success, or romance etc..

i really liked my time at portia and i really like sandrock but all these small/big problems make the game less pleasant to play.
why release a game from early access if it's still so poorly optimized and full of bugs?

hopefully, future updates will make the game more stable and less frustrating.",15092

2023-11-10,it is a relaxing game with a nice pace of achievments and lovely cartoonish graphic. a lot to run around though to gather material and finish some of the orders from the citizens of sandrock. but all so well balanced that there is no boring time. a lot to discover inside and later outside the city.,15092
2023-11-10,"this sequal to my time at portia happens to be as good as, if not better than my time at portia.
the game has tons of improvements, tons of new features and mechanics, tons of quality of life additions, and more that were not in my time at portia.
furthermore it has a much more detailed and exquisite crafting system, farming system, construction system, and combat system, all of which is easy to learn because it wasn't made very complex.
there is also tons of in game tutorials and means to look back at past information, so the player will not get lost as easily as they did in my time at portia.
this game is a massive improvement in many ways. perhaps the only complaint the player could ever have is water management, and even then, for a player that is willing to learn and understand water conservation, a player will learn how to easily manage their water reserves with time and never run out of water (which will take a long time for people who have extreme difficulty with extremely basic management skills and extremely basic learning skills).
in any case, i have been playing this game since closed beta, i was a kickstarter backer, and i think the full release is infinitely superior to the beta, and it is way better than my time at portia, though it is reasonable to understand that the water management system is treated as the reason many people say this game is worse than my time at portia... it is probably the only downside to this game.
everything else is an improvement. if you love the idea of playing a game where you live in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland and are actively working towards rebuilding civilization and restoring the environment to a pristine green condition and don't mind the occasional combat scenario this game is for you.",15092
2023-11-10,"""my time at portia"" was an apparently simple game, and yet it provided a surprisingly deep experience.
after playing for a good while, it's obvious the developers at pathea games took everything they've learned from the project and put it into ""my time at sandrock"".
this new title has been improved over the original in every way possible: graphics, artstyle, combat, animations, activities, characters, story... the list covers literally every single aspect of the game, and even if there's still some rough edges here and there, they're very minor and don't hinder at all the quality of the product.

the game combines life-style (housing, crafting, resource gathering, bonding with other characters...) with action/adventure gameplay (exploration, rpg elements, dungeons, boss fights...). all the while, the city of sandrock grows and develops over time and as the story goes forward, with your contribution.
there's also a dedicated multiplayer mode, focusing exclusively on everything revolving around managing your workshop (no story progression, unfortunately, but the fact it's there as an option to have fun with friends in a game that doesn't really need multiplayer, is already more than enough).

if you're in for a fun, hopeful, wholesome and pleasant adventure filled with likeable characters in a vibrant, living world that makes you truly feel a part of it, then there's no reasons not to give this game a try. 
you'll be genuinely suprised by seeing how much care, affection and attention to details have been put into crafting this little gem and what it has to offer.
the part where you're a builder, tasked with gathering resources and building things is truly just part of the tip of a huge iceberg.

even at full price, it's well worth the money.",15092

2023-11-10,"this game is enjoyable... it's better than my time at portia, but only barely. the writing is genuinely good and voice acting is great. the characters themselves look great as well. inventory is improved but i am not sure that warrants immense praise in a sequel, i would expect more mechanical improvements. the characters are definitely more demanding and engaged. some times i wish they would honestly shove off though, a lot of them are deeply self centered and narcissistic. it's an attempt to show a more realistic community i guess, but so many of them track anti-social and deeply narcissistic that i am not sure who i actually like in the town. kudos i guess on making it feel like i really am in a backwater trash town.

but i waited a long time for it to leave early access, and now i am playing a game that still feels like it is in early access. 

additionally, level design feels very strange. the over world feels janky and the dungeons half baked in design. a lot of areas blocked by invisible walls and lazy graphics.

the town itself is not particularly impressive and walking away from locations feels like i am walking on an unfinished map. many locations are deeply confusing to find and there are many absolutely pointless time wasting caves that have absolutely nothing in them except maybe a chest that drops a pointless piece of loot.

enemy's feel buggy and some of them are massively annoying to fight with a melee weapon. hyena's jump and move constantly, rat men spawn in the air and can't be attacked. combat is definitely more engineered from portia but it doesn't necessarily feel better chasing around a enemy that essentially non-stop roll dodges.

the denizens look better, but you look like a carnival clown. why are we still throwing utility pouches on things like they are 90s super heroes? why can't anyone make a decent pare of pants, i'm tired of running around in ill fitting shorts. i feel like you should be able to reskin the armor in the game to others you have unlocked. maybe that is a thing but it isn't apparent.

----

response to developer:
there are several instances where the corners of the paradise lost (i believe, first combat dungeon) has areas that look traversable that aren't. the fence going into paradise lost looks scalable. walking into the gecko station there is a large dead space around the entrance that can't be walked through, you have to approach the station entrance straight on dead center to enter. aside from that there are several areas that just seems empty though accessible including caves with little reward for exploring them. feels more like i am punished for exploring in a game at least partial about time management, i now default look up a guide the second i am confused. often the guide itself is confused like in the case with of the quest ""whispers of the heart"" where the streamer enters the cave thinking it might be where the quest location is. understandable since heidi appears to lead you there but then disappears (got stuck on terrain in my game) teleportating to the location but with no quest marker except a zone on the map. a quest with no timer listed but which logically does need to be completed that day and fails if not completed.

speaking of quests that need to be completed on time, there are a ton that auto trigger by walking into zones and they can overlap with other quests you have happening. perhaps you designed this to encourage players to not do quests saving them for future playthrough, but i don't think the majority of your users do play the game more than once. games this scale are huge timesinks and i would like to not decline side plot character arc stuff simply because i have 3 of them going simultaneously.the pacing of quests simply doesn't feel in line with the default speed of the game. i understand i can adjust this but i would like the game at least defaulting to an optimal experience. this likely goes into my feelings towards the townfolk being off putting, berating me with quests that really seem like they should be commissions (owen being the biggest offender though also not being told to stop like the others).

after experiencing the combat more i think the problem is the lack of mobility in the main character during a fight. you feel dark souls speed while everyone else (non-duel) feels like they are playing an arcade beat-em up.

i realize now there is a wardrobe tab, not sure how i missed it. apologies for that criticism. now i can wear my button up (with strange disco medalion/compass) and pants like a normie.

i think some of my irritation is the above mentioned side quest pacing. a lot of characters don't really grow much and feel very one sided in their relationship with you, qi in particular is deeply narcissistic and so central to the plot. there are definitely great characters but the ones who have big character flaws very rarely if ever showcase anything redeeming. would be satisfying to be able to get back at yan even a little and i have been playing the game for an in game year. arvio really needs to not be a screw up once in a while. amirah has 0 warmth even after being stuck making 50 fireworks for an event no one shows up to she responds to with a trailing ellipsis. i mean what is the player expectation here? if it's just the clique getting together to watch fireworks than why not have that happen? if it's a setup for a date why does amirah respond to even the most mild show of affection with a trailing ellipsis? how long do you want me to humor this fleeting youth club when they don't show up to their own events and, if it's a romance line, don't seem interested in you? i feel like i am doing a huge number of quests just to up relationship points, not because i enjoy them.

when's justice going to not be a failure riding off others? i'd love him to show some reason why anyone would want him as sheriff. miguel is a psycho. fang drugs me for his own amusement.

final complaint, clay and bloodstone are deeply relied on for commissions. they are very difficult to source without going back to the first dungeon or buying some from a store behind a loading screen. i have so much stone and sand at this point i could forge another sandrock in an effort to source clay and bloodstone and this is with me having built up a ton of bloodstone building a ridiculous field of moisture farms and needing the marble (p.s. please let us automate collection from these or something...).",15092

2023-11-10,it is a relaxing game with a nice pace of achievments and lovely cartoonish graphic. a lot to run around though to gather material and finish some of the orders from the citizens of sandrock. but all so well balanced that there is no boring time. a lot to discover inside and later outside the city.,15092

2023-11-10,"an amazing breath of life in a somewhat stagnated genre. the characters feel non-generic and interesting. the crafting is fun and doesn't feel like a grind. becoming friends with other characters is fun! the fighting system has a smidge of depth, and the tool upgrades keep it interesting. so many characters, clocking in over 100 total. love love this game and i have yet to even touch the multiplayer aspects. 

if you ever feel rushed by games like this they even let you slow down the days! no more rushing.

2023-11-09,"sandrock takes all of the cute charm from the first game and cranks it up to 11. 
combat has been greatly expanded and improved from the first game. the inclusion of boss fights with actual mechanics is something i never thought a cozy game like this would include. i was surprised when the mechanical cat boss showed up and i couldn't just spam the attack button on it. 
as for the visuals of the game, they are charming. the townsfolk feel much more alive than the first game and i am super glad they got rid of the main characters voice which was my biggest dislike from portia. this is just personal preference though, i've never been a fan of voiced pcs.

2023-11-09,"i had not played previous games by this developer, so for me there was a fairly hefty learning curve.  still, the story line, visuals, interaction, and game play are all interesting and very enjoyable.  it quickly became the game i want to play more than others.  
it isn't without bugs, but the developer is responsive and releasing patches frequently.  none of the glitches i've experienced have impacted my ability to play the game.  at one point the event audio got out-of-sync and i was hearing dialog from both previous and future events.  it was annoying, but not a game-stopper and closing/reopening the game resolved it.  another issue where display of elevators was lagging saw a fix released the very next day (kudos!) 
for me, the user interface seems inconsistent and somewhat clunky.  here are a few examples:  i'm not a fan of holding 'tab' to switch to garden mode, scrolling to select an action, then pressing 'e' to select the seed, etc.  at worst, it can be frustrating determining the mouse/keystrokes needed to perform an action.  at best, it is never something i can do via muscle-memory without thinking.  device production statistics is also not well laid out. even after playing a considerable time i still have to study each machine's statistics to find the bit of information i'm looking for.   one positive, there is an icon in each device that allows focusing it to requirements of pending tasks--love that.  there is also a need for improvement to the main map to add more detail and descriptions.  an item might say it can be found in the quarry, but the quarry is not labelled on the map.  
the above items are minor to me and overall i enjoy this game and highly recommend it. 
",15069
2023-11-09,"in love with this game :)
has everything that portia had but with small changes to the design to make the game more enjoyable! e.g you can place bigger storage boxes on top of the current smaller ones instead of removing everything from inside of the box minecraft style, or when carrying out a quest which requires items on hand, you can still complete it with the items still back at the workshop when in storage!

to keep you interested, the game offers a ton of features and content, such the ability to make hundreds of objects, interact with the locals and fall in love, cultivate crops, battle monsters, and take part in festivals and minigames. the voice acting is funny and well-done, the music is catchy and calming, and the images are vivid and colorful.",15069

i am praying. please let this series continue.",15069
2023-11-09,"if you played my time at portia and enjoyed it - you'll love this one! tons of quality of life features have gone in that make it a blast to play, especially with inventory management which is one of the biggest factors of this type of game (such as naming your chests, and an ability to ""just stack similar items from my inventory into any of my chests"") 

in comparison to something such as stardew valley (love!) i would say it's similar but different. sandrock isn't a farming sim for one - it's mostly focused on you being a builder. so it's a lot more on getting a workshop, crafting, setting up automation, etc. 
of course there is still animal rearing and farming that can be had! but it's not the primary focus. 

the world is still a great time, the characters in the city are fantastic (and voice acted often!) and a blast to go out on dates, have lunch with, or just say howdy in the town for. 

the combat is rather enjoyable as well! makes monster battling more enjoyable than many other games of this style. 

big tip i'd have: if you find the days going by too quick (or too slow), you can change the gameplay speed! i found at first a little overwhelmed as i was trying to do commissions each day & by the time i finished, i was running out of daylight! but then i just changed the gameplay speed (0.7 is my sweet spot i think) and it's just the perfect amount for me. 

overall, if you like cozy life sim's where you can just sit back, relax and enjoy yourself. would recommend :)",15069

2023-11-09,"i was a big fan of portia and this game really delivered on improving many things that made portia a bit hard to like. building up a failing town is a lot ore interesting than turning an already nice town into a tourist attraction. there are a lot of the same issues i had with portia though, which is a bit disappointing. targeting with the pickhammer/axe is kind of wonky, there are a lot of visual glitches that are kind of funny to see but also super immersion breaking. you'll be talking to someone in a sandstorm and their protective gear will bounce up and down on their head or you'll be walking around town and a row of bushes will fly up into the air and gently bounce while still suspended above you. it's not enough to make me stop playing but it does get frustrating.",15069

2023-11-09,"i don't really get the hype i guess. the characters are pretty fun, but feel very one-dimensional. the combat looks great until you actually start fighting. and why is everything so insanely vast and empty? the comically large buildings make the town feel like you could've just as well had a portal hub, and going from a to b makes you wonder why they even made a run button. might as well make it your standard speed since you're constantly pressing it.

definitely an upgrade from portia when it comes to the quality of life, but with the desert setting the problems i had with portia only get magnified in sandrock. if you didn't like portia don't get this game i guess",15069
2023-11-09,"please note that i am a kickstarter backer.

sandrock improves on portia by leaps and bounds. it takes the addicting loop of gathering resources to build machines to finish projects to build better machines to work with other resources and wraps it in a cozy blanket of interesting npcs and a deep setting. 

this is not a farming game. even though it will inevitably be compared to stardew and the wave of other similar games that have been released over the years, this is not a farming game. to me personally, sandrock is much closer to modded minecraft, factorio, or satisfactory. what you do get, inspired by stardew (harvest moon, shout out to the og) and its legacy, are npcs to talk to and romance, quests to fulfil for said npcs, and regular festivals.

i personally enjoy the very clear loop of resource gathering and refinement to fulfil quests immensely. like portia (as rough around the edges as it was), sandrock is very good at finding the balance between regular resource gathering to make any progress, without becoming too grindy (but! i'd guess i am in the latter first third of the game, so who knows if this stays true). resources can be acquired in many ways, and there's always one that is easiest or most enjoyable to do. 

npcs feel much deeper than in your average cozy farming game, with several of them having their own agency beyond reacting to your input. you might want to romance one of the bachelorettes, but she might not be sure that it's something that fits into her or your life - and so you have to do quests and navigate dialogue to figure the problem out together.
many of the npcs also step out of the typical archetypes as you get to know them, or offer archetypes from the get-go that aren't often used in these types of games. 

i thoroughly enjoy the writing, which i did not expect to this amount. i certainly liked portia, but i feel like the localisation of sandrock is a big improvement (except for not giving us qi's or fang's full names!). there are plenty of references to popular culture that actually made me chuckle. 

several - but not all - voice actors are also doing a fantastic job. i had pen written off as uninteresting from the start, but his voice actor is doing an incredible job with his character, and i have come to enjoy him much more than i thought. however, some voice actors keep throwing me off with their line deliveries, or their accents. nothing i could not see beyond or that would fully break immersion, but still noticeable if contrasted with the excellent other cast members.

at time of writing this review, i have played through 1.5 seasons in about 30 hours of gameplay. i do not rush any quests and make full use of the non-existent deadlines for major plot quests. i feel like i am just about have the plot open up for me, and have not even arrived at later content that is hailed to be the best. i'm certainly looking forward to experiencing the rest of this game, and would recommend this game to anyone.",15069
2023-11-09,"i liked ""my time at portia"" in spite of what it needed still in terms of polish. it was an ambitious game with many of the things it tried felt mostly half baked and not fully flushed out.

i can happily say that ""my time at sandrock"" not only meets the levels set up by it's predecessor, but also far exceeds them. 

first, the game proudly sticks with it's theme. every aspect of this is themed around you being in a desert, from basic crafting to even fishing. on a side note, this is easily the better fishing mini games i've played, but i wont spoil how that works.

second, the story is very engaging. ~50ish hours in, i'm very immersed in the setting and very motivated to keep going. the characters all seem to have their own motivations and there's a plethora of areas where their quests have pay off, both big and small. the small, being a mark of true craftsmanship.

third, the relationship mechanics are fantastic. they don't expand the barebones from the previous game (if it ain't broke don't fix it) but there's more to do around sandrock than portia. i do have a favorite addition though [spoiler] you literally hold hands with your partner when you're out on a date, they'll keep up with you as you run. this is the cutest damn thing in the world. bless whomever pushed that to get in because it was worth it.[/spoiler] 

if you've played the sequel, than this should be a no brainer. if you've not played the series, if not, i'd probably recommend going with the previous game first, but don't let that stop you if you're eager to start. there's nothing in portia that's critical for sandrock to be enjoyable.",15069
2023-11-09,"multiplayer has zero story missions and zero achievements, which they do not tell you before you buy!! i only bought this game to play with my bf, and we had a lot of fun building our home together and improving the town, but we were extremely disappointed that we cannot experience the story together, and with nearly 40 hours into the game, we still haven't unlocked a single achievement. i will never play this game solo, i am only interested in playing multiplayer, and i feel cheated out of the full experience. if they add story missions and achievements to multiplayer, then i will change my review to recommended.",15069
2023-11-09,"this is a tremendously satisfying game about harvesting materials, crafting, completing tasks, and helping a town prosper.  it's easy to see just a few hours in just how much thought has gone into the systems.  there's plenty to do to fill a day, and new main and side quests pop up on the regular to keep you moving forward.  the game respects your time with convenient tooltips, tutorials, and things like paying to expand your bags directly from your inventory, or being able to complete objectives with materials in your storage.

the social aspect of the game is also surprisingly strong.  the characters are often interesting and the writing is genuinely funny.  there's an interplay of story and gameplay as certain events will cause prices of goods to fluctuate or prompt a community response.  there are mini-activities to do with townsfolk to increase affinity and neat holidays.  there's also lore bits here and there that i did not expect to be as poignant as they are. 

there is combat, and it is fine, but i do not think that is the main draw.  my only complaints would be nitpicks.  the random character customization produces some nightmarish results, and the house expansion system is somewhat fiddly.  

this is a strong recommend.",15069
2023-11-12,pretty dope,18838
2023-11-12,loving the game! been playing for 12 hours and i still have so much content to go through!,18838
2023-11-12,i played the early access to this game and hit the end of the current content. this game is an amazing successor to the original. this game is a solid 10/10 and as of today i am starting a fresh play through for the soul reason of playing it now that it has been released in full.,18838
2023-11-09,"      as someone who has played their fair share of life simulation games, with the variety of animal crossing, stardew valley, and palia to be some of the main ones, this game comes very close to beating them all. i was thrilled to find out that this game was going to have multiplayer in it, seeing as my time at portia does not have multiplayer, which heavily influenced my choice to buy it or not.

      this game can be buggy at times and while i only have a 980 gpu, i can run this game at medium settings and it still looks pretty decent. i did not play the early access, only full release, and i can say that there seems to be quite a bit of content to this game. this game is very multifaceted with social/town, farming, combat, mining, building, animal, and pet aspects, with that just being what i have discovered with 19 hours of playing. i play with 2 other people and the game runs fairly well. i have only encountered a few lag/server sync issues between other players, a few ui glitch errors, and 1 wonky combat fight with an elite. but beyond those few things i haven't seen much to stop me from wanting to play this game as much as possible. 


[h3] pros [/h3]
- lots of content (19 hours in and it feels like i have so much more to do)
- decent price (i was gifted the game but seeing the price for how fun this game is seems fair)
- fun with friends
- multiplayer actual works
- leveling up feels important and good
- missions feel good and not like leg work (you can visually see the work you put into the town)
- tons of townspeople
- combat feels good and fun
- character customization (you can super customize your character with sliders)
- gear (weapons and clothes have stats that can help you with gathering and fighting)
- weather (the weather events in this game are really great. so far i have seen rain, sandstorm, and summer 
   heat. i am waiting to see snow in this game as of yet.)
- server stays up (no matter who owns the town, i am able to play on my friends server even after the 
   person who made it has left. this is a big game changer for me seeing as you don't have to stop playing on 
   one server because the host has left or crashed.)

[h3] cons [/h3]

- desync/stutter issues (i have only had this happen 2-3 times playing so far and it is fixed by a simple return 
  to lobby and rejoin.)
- ui machine icons disappear (i have only seen this once and it was fixed by rejoining the lobby)
- forced personal chests (i mention this because it was a pain to have only so much room in the one 
   community chest you get at the start of the game. you can upgrade it, but i would like to have the option 
   to share my personal chest contents if i choose to. and not have to run back to home every time someone 
   needed something.
- combat (could use a little work on hit registration and how your character can go through the enemies 
   while swinging your weapon)
- accidental playable character requests (in the game there is an option to talk to real people and play a 
   mini-game called critters. it feels a bit annoying at times when you are trying to interact with machines or 
   doors and other playable characters get the input over the item/machine/door. could be quite annoying if 
   playing with a lot of people in one area but not too bad overall.)

overall this game feels pretty fun to play and in just 2 days my friends and i have put in almost 20 hours each.",15069
2023-11-09,"update: newest game update has significantly decreased my issues, i still experience some long loading screens, but the game is playable, and waiting 5-10 minutes the odd time is fine. thank you for this quick hot fix. 


unfortunately the game is unplayable solo, i can play bg3 on ultra settings. but solo sandrocks loading screens take 10-15 minutes (sometimes longer) per interaction, sleep, leaving/entering the home, or literally anything in the game, including talking to npc's. i have barley any issues on multiplayer, other then the fact some areas/missions are impossible due to certain things missing in multi(but its playable).

i waited for the release because i was such a fan of the first one and even played via xbox live pass.

currently i am surfing the web for fixes, from uninstalling, reinstalling, turning cloud off, turning every setting to low, switching graphics cards/cpu's. mind you i have no other processes running, and can play other games that require so much more usage. currently re-verifying the files, in hopes i can play the game solo when my partner is not on, and not ruin our multiplayer game. 

currently i consider this game to be completely early access still, and unplayable for most. i found online via reddit, many people having the same issue. 

developers i am sorry but until this is fixed, this review will remain the same, as your product is extremely expensive and at least should run the basics like being able to leave/enter my home, or sleep without it taking 15+ minutes each thing.

2023-11-09,"the game is incredibly fun. i am more of an explorer guy, but i also enjoy farming and crafting, though the game does not really have much of that exploration or adventuring going on they really spoil you a lot with crafting and farming. socializing with the npcs is also fun and so much stuff and features with the npcs. i have never tried multiplayer, but it is a fantastic addition to playing with friends or families. honestly if i were to describe the game it would be a full-on essay, the game just has so much content, i would say it is a combination of animal crossing and stardew valley. i totally recommend it to people looking for casual and relaxing farm and craft game.",15069
2023-11-09,"i didn't play a lot of my time at portia but i picked this up anyway because i still liked it and i was curious what the developers were going to do with their next installment. i was not disappointed, i love this game and i like it way more than portia. the characters, story, and romance (the reverse confessions and reverse proposals are so sweet!) are well done, even the cheesy moments. i have to gush about the story for a moment, there were some things that i saw coming, but there were a few moments where i had to keep myself from yelling out loud because i just couldn't believe it! 

i really liked how they changed how you're able to build items, you don't need to have something in your hand in order to have it built. and when diving in ruins, the scanner highlights all of the possible relics instead of just one at a time. the map is huge, and even though its a desert, there is a lot to do especially with hunting monsters and collecting materials. 

if you played portia, whether if it was a little bit or a lot, you're going to like this game! and if this is your first time, i hope you give sandrock a chance because it's a gem of a game.",15069
2023-11-10,"loved my time at portia, and this game is 10x better! so many qol improvements over portia, and there are a ton of quests here. the number of quests can be overwhelming, but many of them aren’t timed, so you can relax and play at your own speed for the most part. 

all of my hours have been played on the steam deck, and it’s been a nearly flawless experience!",15092
