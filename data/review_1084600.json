I usually try to list and rate major factors of a game  so others don't have to work on my opinion alone, but we will be here all day if I list them. Some of the top things for me are character customization both in creation and outfits, variety of romance options (and honestly the weirdly charming townsfolk in general), and the ease of crafting, turning in commissions, and mining are the first to pop into my head. But others such as the game pacing, accessibility features like being able to slow down the game speed, and fluidity of combat are very close to the top as well. \n\nThe bad:\nHonestly not much. There are some small video glitches, and the housing and yard customization can be troublesome (I really wish there was a confirmation button for the retrieve option when you are trying to move stuff around your yard, cause I just wanted to move it not take it all back into my inventory). But nothing else stands out as really needing attention.

Portia was cute but this definitely deserves all the praise because it is certainly a leap forward. Both games are charming, but the characters of Sandrock are really growing on me and I feel invested in this little \"Desert Rose\". I wouldn't initially telling anyone they'll be doing a lot of farming, although the game does have farming and the controls for it are fairly intuitive, which was surprising. The farming itself is very forgiving, but mostly you'll find yourself repairing the improving the town and building machines. The end goal is of course to live your quaint life and you can build houses or even import them from other people, which was a smart move as admittedly I find the house building a bit frustrating. I'd like to see some improvement on the livestock, although they're sufficiently adorable I kind of wish we could milk the yakmel and water/food was separate and the barn was a little more detailed. I'd gladly pay for that sort of DLC once they finish completing all the updates to the game. In the meantime, I really like the story and I very much love a game where I can actively improve my own \"base\" but also the town/environment around it, which this definitely does in abundance.

I think having a management like farm like game is fun where you are constantly fighting for water. Some things get tedious such as the critters minigame if you intend to maximize your relationships with the townspeople but it is rather unnecessary if you don't really care about it. You are punished for trying to build a lot of machines in your area which is fine. It's a nice touch to management.\n\nI find the game laggy the more you play it as it starts chugging memory and causes loading times to be unreasonable. Because of this, it causes a bunch of glitches such as invisible villagers, teleporting people and enemies and long long asset loading to where you need to pause. If you don't have enough space on your main hard drive, which I don't. I highly recommend skipping this game unless your computer can run a modded skyrim game with 200+ mods and I will say skyrim will still run better than this game.\n\nIt is because of the loading issues that I really can't recommend this game to anyone.

Not sure why they are marked, but my suggestion is to just do all the side quests as the story progresses.\n2) There is a small area that requires platforming.. not a bid deal, but I HATE platforming so I did find it a little frustrating.

So if you don't like to fight or kill monsters, then maybe reconsider getting this game.\n4) I do not have good hand eye coordination so some of the boss battles are problematic for me.

The devs/team actually care/listen and constantly make updates, fix bugs, and add NEW content depending on what people really want and keep asking for.

Anyone can hop in at anytime and that was a HUGE game changer for me. \n\nACHIEVEMENT HUNTERS TAKE NOTE: no achievements can be earned in multiplayer. They are single player exclusive. \n\nAs for the actual gameplay, it's been jaw droppingly sensational.

While not perfect, it massively improves on many aspects from its predecessor, My Time at Portia (MTaP), while successfully experimenting with new ideas. Most of my gripes with the game are largely small, inconsequential things, though there are a couple that really stood out as being almost impressively bad for such a great game. Overall I loved it and I'm crushed that my play-through has ended. 8.5/10\n\n[h3] Pros [/h3]\n - Huge boost in QoL from MTaP; inventory management is a dream, voiced dialogue is consistent instead of feeling random, you have more freedom to explore, and so on \n - Performance; I have a GTX 1070 and an i7700k so my rig is definitely aging...however I was easily able to keep my fps at 70+. The only dips were when most/all of the cast was on screen at once and was moving around (some firesides, but oddly not an issue during any of the festivals)\n - Content; I just finished all the quests and my save file reads at 144 hours. There is a shockingly gargantuan amount of content to play through. While there are always \"fetch this\" quests, very few felt like their main purpose was to add filler *coughACValhallacough* and the main quests carried a strong identity (Sandrock is a dying town and constantly goes from crisis to crisis)\n - Cast/writing; I felt most of the VAs did a great job and overall the writing did a great job in both conveying humor and seriousness. Every quest you take with Justice + Unsuur is full of golden dialogue, Burgess is wonderfully self-aware, and so on.\n - Music; A major step-up from MTaP. I mean, the musical score for MTaP wasn't bad per se...well the combat music and ruins exploration music were both pretty...okay everything but the sparring music was pretty mediocre (the sparring music slapped). MTaS has a much, *much* better musical score in essentially every aspect.\n - Impact; You as the protagonist have a large and meaningful impact in the game. Sandrock goes through a food crisis, water crisis, vegetation crisis, and you can visually see the effects they have on the town, both before and after. It made me feel, in my opinion at least, like what I was doing was...purposeful, helpful. \n - Combat; they really stepped up the combat from MTaP and it is a much smoother and more enjoyable experience. There are distinct weapon types: [strike] dual blades [/strike] daggers, greatsword, [strike] insect-less glaive [/strike] spear and [strike] SnS [/strike] Sword + Shield, along with some guns, throwables, and a couple unique weapons. \n - Quality; less of a \"pro\" and more of \"not a con\", any game where items/gear posses quality tiers is fraught with danger. Sandrock does a great job with quality (aside from the names, I mean Ordinary -> Oustanding -> Perfect -> Rare doesn't make sense to me). You can refine many items/weapons/gear to raise their level at the expense of a couple gems/minerals and it never feels like a brutal grind to do so....except for any item that wants agate to level up, agate sucks to get. Literally everything else though is totally fine.\n - Creativity; As mentioned Sandrock is built on a pitifully small oasis. It used to be lush but has been almost entirely claimed by desertification. Mechanically, the game requires you to use water to \"cool\" your machines (water being one of the very few parts of the game that remained an actual obstacle throughout the play through). You are not allowed to cut down any trees within the boundaries of Sandrock proper (early game finding wood is a unique challenge). These, along with taking over a dozen kinds of scrap into the new recycling machines, do a fantastic job of mixing up game play and how new tiers of materials get introduced.\n\n[h3] Neutral [/h3] \n - Skill Tree; your experience gets both added to a total, overall level (health/stamina) and divided into either social, gathering, workshop or combat based on where the XP was earned. This is a mixed bag for me because the perks are very obviously either \"must-haves\" (+1 break damage, +1 daily commission) or \"super terrible\" (any of the *many* perks that give you +10% xp/chance for/etc). The extra xp is bad because....\n\n[h3] Cons: [/h3] (Review too long, only showing the two that plagued me)\n - Difficulty; The game is easy. No, that's not fair. It is stunningly, disappointingly, shockingly easy. I'm not asking this to be Dark Souls; if I wanted that I'd...go play Dark Souls. What I mean is that I was over-leveled (>= 8 levels above) for 90% of the game,  and massively over-leveled (>= 14) for about 40% of it. The greater the level difference, the less damage is taken/received a-la borderlands style. Immunity frames when dodging are [i] incredibly [/i] generous; you have i-frames for the entire animation and a little extra, meaning you can just chain rolls for invulnerability and you can lazily roll through the few environmental obstacles thrown at you. However, as you are far above the recommended level, you won't even be dodging because you barely get hurt. The bosses are actually well designed, far better than MTaP...but again, you don't need to engage in any of their mechanics you are a much higher level than they. Also there are 0 attacks that cannot be avoided by simply....running in a different direction. Earned experience points are also far too generous. Sparring Pen and the Dive buzzard near the railroad tracks were the only two fights that I felt challenged; every other combat experience was a cake-walk. Pathea could slash all earned xp by 25% and *maybe* you'd fall into the recommended range, but only if you never explored, did side quests or commissions. This is why 40% of the skill tree feels pointless. Every perk doesn't need to be in perfect balance...but I'm already stomping everything I do not need a 10% chance to get double experience for kicking trees. Gear cannot be used it you are below it's specified level but, once more, that had 0 effect on my gameplay outside of the first couple in-game weeks. Sandstorms are supposed to be deadly, you are told to either stay inside or don protective gear. Spoiler, it doesn't matter. Wear whatever you want. The game makes some light attempts into platforming (which were done well) with the exception of the massive arrows that always tell you where to go. I could go on; suffice it to say I loved so much of the game but I never really felt \"challenged\" at virtually any point.\n - Path finding. I mean wow, I was blown away by how unbelievably abysmal the path finding is. I've watched sandrock residents get stuck walking into building corners, get stuck walking into plants, decorations, each other, things that are invisible to me yet inexplicably manifest a collision box, animals, fences...if it exists in game, they've gotten stuck on it. Repeatedly. In the first 3 minutes of the game you are offered a tour by the ten-year-old Jasmine who after saying, \"follow me\" immediately turns around and gets stuck on a rock. The \"solution\" was to cause a character to fade out and reappear after they fail to move in their desired direction for a couple seconds. They only sometimes do that. Sometimes they just give up and stand there until something breaks their error loop (if you host a party expect to talk to everybody constantly so they dont freeze in place). Sometimes the pathing routes of everybody (enemies included) get shifted. Now the bumble ants that are on the hill 200 feet to the east of your workshop eternally try to path into your fence. If a sandrocker has been catastrophically shifted from their normal route you may watch as they teleport back and forth between two spots (looking at your Pen, Rocky and Krystal). Your children are a complete enigma and refuse to abide by any pathfinding laws. Good luck trying to change that diaper before you lose relationship with them and your spouse because they crawled outside the clearly-defined boundaries of your home.", "timestamp_created": 1700207549, "timestamp_updated": 1700207847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150265464": {"recommendationid": "150265464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050570807", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 5371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4075, "playtime_at_review": 5371, "last_played": 1700203540}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best romance mechanics ever.

I went in not knowing how much of a focus the game had on story, and was very pleasantly surprised at the writing, direction, length and depth of the story and world building.\n\nAs a complete game with a satisfying amount of content, this game would easily take about 100+ hours to complete for the average person.\n\nPros:\n(+) Excellent story line that kept me motivated to see what happens next. A lot of effort has been put into the story and set pieces, more so than similar Life Sim / Farming games.\n(+) Addictive gameplay progression loop and pacing of progressing through the main story, upgrading your tools and workshop, and making lasting changes to Sandrock.\n(+) Well written characters that you learn a lot about and grow to love / care for through your time with them. Characters each have their backstories, motivations and distinctive personalities which contribute to the social feel of Sandrock, as well as the narrative.\n(+) Wide variety of customization options for player character appearance, and workshop (including housing, furniture, plants and decorations).\n\nSubjective:\n(=) Movement feel a bit \"weightless\"; there is no momentum to movement.\n(=) Resource gathering may feel grindy at times especially if you try to optimize stamina usage each day, but is over-all well balanced if you pace yourself through daily commissions and exploring the sidequests.\n(=) The mini games are very charming, and add a lot to the festivals / events in the game's calendar. However, they may be more simplistic than one would expect.\n\nCons:\n(-) Several minor bugs at release, personally have yet to experience anything gamebreaking.

Aesthetically pretty much everything has improved from the character models to the environmental design. \n\nOne of the most interesting things this game does is up-end the typical farming sim tropes to fit its setting and story. When you start, Instead of cutting down countless trees or laying out plots of crops, you're salvaging scrap wood, weeds and dewdrops, always at risk of running out of water. Then you're diving into ruins for copper and old circuit boards, and eventually you're fighting mutants and robots for advanced computer chips and high-quality alloys, building back an environment where you can safely cut down trees and plant massive fields without guilt. It's not really a factory game and there aren't a ton of interactive tools/machines to build to make things easier, but there's still something satisfying about building up the machines and seeing the improvements you've made around town.\n\nCharacters aren't that deep but they've done a good job not only on improving the visual complexity of their design but also adding some interest to their story-lines. It's legitimately hard to choose which marriage candidate to focus on as there's a lot of good options for both men and women. There's some of fun twists and character development you wouldn't normally see in a farming sim, though overall the plot and dialogue is very PG. There's not much in the way of major character relationship drama or more mature/realistic themes.\n\nLater on the game can get kind of slow as you wait until the next day to continue quests, and the need for money/resources/relationship points disappears. In the options menu, there's an option to speed up the passage of time during the day up to 3x, or slow it down significantly, so you don't feel rushed while collecting resources, or bored waiting for machines to complete. This feature is honestly one of the best things in the game as it gives you a ton of control over the pacing.\n\nThe combat isn't great - it's pretty easy and attacks/hitboxes feel a bit awkward - but it's more complex than Stardew Valley or Dinkum, and has some interesting mechanics and boss fights; it's most comparable to Rune Factory. You're not playing a farming sim because you expect it to be Dark Souls.\n\nIf like I do, you consider Stardew Valley and Rune Factory be the (recent) defining games of this genre, My Time at Sandrock is definitely up there in the top 5.", "timestamp_created": 1700195258, "timestamp_updated": 1700195258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150258618": {"recommendationid": "150258618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053615818", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 7942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4936, "playtime_at_review": 7402, "last_played": 1700475320}, "language": "english", "review": "So, I beat My Time at Sandrock in a little over 122 hours. Quite frankly, I felt the game could have been longer. I mean, by the time I felt like I resolved my money issues, the story was over. With how much world building the developers have done between Sandrock and Portia, the game could have and in my opinion, should have been a lot longer. I don't want to spoil the game too much for those still playing but with Duvos representing the evil empire and how many open ended story lines they could have expanded upon, the game was just too short.  \n\nThe Pathea Games developers could have had the builder after the story line in Sandrock was finished tp then travel to the other free cities building them up and connecting them while fighting Duvos along the way with the story ending in the victory against the evil empire.\n\nWith my playthrough, I focused solely on the quests and commissions, I didn't dabble much in anything else. I imagine you would get a lot more out of My Time at Sandrock if you did all the social stuff. But for me, I never got around to marrying anyone or having a kid because I was always so broke to afford a bigger home. I was going by how My Time at Portia went with you needing to have a little bit of income, a nest egg if you will, in  order to establish a family, and all my gols went towards upgrading the shop and buying land.  \n\nPerhaps though, that is my own fault. Still, with how expensive land expansion is and the higher tier of houses, I do wonder if the amount of gols provided to the player was too few and far between. \n\nGranted, I know the objective is to earn your money, but as I found out later in the game the shops never had enough gols themselves to buy my crops and I ended up having to travel all the way to the ruins to sell them in the vending machine, which is good that was an option, it is just a bit of an inconvenience. I was also disappointed in the lack of enemies there was to fight after the last Ruin Diving location as I bought and crafted some of the best, if not the best gear in the game but never got the chance to use it on enemies that would challenge me. I know it sounds like I am complaining a lot, I just wanted more.\n\nI may continue playing for the achievements but with the story progression done, I have lost that drive to want to boot up the game.

Yes. I really wish they could tone down how much busywork is in these games and the reliance of in-game timers to finish crafting items and juggling between multiple devices. But this is really my only strong criticism other than fairly weak combat.\n\nBut this life sim does one thing better than any other released this year or in recent memory - it creates a real sense of community and growth. My biggest bugbear about games like Animal Crossing is that you, the player, are the only person doing anything to help the world around you while everyone just sits pretty and asks you to do the work. Sandrock has you working with other characters to produce a better world and that's great. Is this a facade most of the time where you're doing exactly the same amount of work as in any other game? Probably - but it helps to see the other builders put in work and to see donation boxes already partially full from other members of the community even if it is a trick. \n\nThe characters are mostly pretty memorable and interesting - I usually struggle in other games of this type with remembering who is who, especially with romance-able characters who all seem bland and slapdash - and it does a good job of creating pricks in the community who you really wish you didn't have to deal with but have to because that's how a community is sometimes. \n\nThe final 'act' of the game is quite special and while it had some of the grindiest components, I was glad I stuck through it because it was good to see how much of a difference I had made from when the game started and where I ended up in a way these games often don't really do. \n\nAll in all, I highly recommend it as one of my favourite games of 2023 but I'd like to see future entries in the series maybe tone down the grind.", "timestamp_created": 1700175938, "timestamp_updated": 1700175938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150243725": {"recommendationid": "150243725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134878295", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 6141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5749, "playtime_at_review": 3427, "last_played": 1700497732}, "language": "english", "review": "[h2] Multiplayer Feedback for My Time at Sandrock [/h2]\n\nFirstly, we want to express our appreciation for the unique multiplayer experience you've introduced in My Time at Sandrock. After investing over 50 hours+ into the game, My wife and I compiled our thoughts and feedback, focusing primarily on the multiplayer aspect. It's important to note that our feedback pertains exclusively to multiplayer, as we have yet to explore the single-player mode.\n\n[b] Let's delve into the areas that could use improvement: [/b]\n\n[h3] 1. Lack of Freedom in a Server-Based World [/h3]\nThe introduction of a server-based world is both a blessing and a curse. While the ability to play even when the host is inactive is commendable, it restricts player freedom. In contrast to the multiplayer mechanics of [b]Stardew Valley[/b], where an account-based server offers players the freedom to modify the game using mods, console commands, and more, [b]My Time at Sandrock[/b] a sandbox multiplayer game focus falls short in this regard.\n[list]\n[*] Comparison with Stardew Valley Multiplayer\n\nStardew Valley allows mods and extensive customization, adding costumes to NPCs, changing NPC portraits, incorporating extra heart events, enhancing UI, introducing new characters, implementing console commands, even freezing time and more. The only limitation is the necessity for the host to be active, a trade-off that hasn't posed a significant issue, since I can just turn on my pc (I'm the host) and let them do whatever they want in the farm, even if my character faints due to lack of sleep, there are no adverse consequences or losses incurred because of the mods.\n\n[*] Impact on Gameplay Experience\n\nThe current server-based setup in [b]My Time at Sandrock[/b] detracts from the immersive storytelling experience. If one player is offline, progressing through quests and other activities becomes challenging due to the accelerated passage of in-game time. This time constraint induces stress rather than fostering a relaxing gameplay environment. The server is very strict when modifying our own world.\n[/list]\n\n[h3] 2. Time Progression Does Not Stop in Multiplayer Mode Even If You Are Alone. [/h3]\n[list]\n[*] A notable drawback of the server-based approach is that in multiplayer worlds with only one active player, time relentlessly marches on regardless if you are in menu mode, inventory, etc. This poses a challenge for players who meticulously plan and min-max their activities, especially when friends are offline. Try to implement a \"Private/Account based\" multiplayer world, allowing players to host their own servers, would offer a solution to this predicament and empower players to play the game on their terms. ( Some might say, stop playing and wait for your friends to get online ). \n[i]That would counter the fact that the multiplayer server-based is [b]useless[/b] since we have to wait for everyone to be online, right?[/i]\n[/list]\n\n[h3] 3. Achievements and Milestones in Multiplayer [/h3]\n\n[list]\n[*] Adding achievements to multiplayer mode seems to be a missed opportunity. While the game already features milestones, incorporating a system to track personal achievements and synchronizing them with Steam achievements would enhance the multiplayer experience. If some achievement is only accessible in singleplayer, then we would have another reason to play the singleplayer mode.\n\n[*] Yes, you can play multiplayer mode for 500+ hours, complete everything you need and you still have 0/60 achievements. \nNot cool.\n[/list]\n\n[h3] 4. Shared Storage Challenges and Quest Completion [/h3]\n\n[list]\n[*] The existing shared storage system, offering capacities of 80(?), 120, and 300 at levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively, introduces significant challenges, particularly during the [b]early and mid-game phases[/b]. This challenge is accentuated in multiplayer scenarios where multiple players contribute to the shared storage. Once the shared storage reaches its capacity, we're compelled to resort to \"personal storage,\" limiting access for other players.\n\n[*] The inconvenience arises when different players hold distinct resources, gone offline then other players need those items for quests. They will have to farm again, since time does not stop. Unlike the seamless, automatic quest item retrieval feature present in single-player mode, the multiplayer experience introduces additional complexities, requiring deliberate coordination among players to ensure efficient quest completion.\n[/list]\n\n[h3] Final Note [/h3]\n\nSince this review is heavily focused on the multiplayer mode, we regrettably find it necessary to vote \"do not recommend\" for players specifically seeking a satisfying multiplayer experience. We remain hopeful that future updates will address these concerns, and we are open to revising our review once improvements are implemented.", "timestamp_created": 1700169319, "timestamp_updated": 1700169319, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541786134243011475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150239133": {"recommendationid": "150239133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145560727", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 136, "playtime_at_review": 610, "last_played": 1700091262}, "language": "english", "review": "played 5 hours in EA  and  3 hours  after it came out\n\nI just don't have as much fun in this game as I did in the first one.

You can take your friends on hang outs and participate in a few activities (like playing at the game centre or chatting by the oasis to learn more about them). This is a really neat feature, and I can honestly say I don't know if Portia was the same or similar because I simply didn't make it that far, lol. If you chose to date someone, you can do different activities with them as well, and even hug and kiss them when you  want to (so cute). \n\nI'm also really excited for the multiplayer option.

The characters are interesting, there's lots to do, plenty of fun world building.\n\nHowever I would be lying to you if I didn't also say it's really janky. Despite it being in full release now, it still plays a Early Access game. A really fun Early Access game with a lot of content, but still an Early Access game. I've had quests glitch out and repeat over and over. I've gotten softlocked in weird glitchy areas more than once. A fairly important recipe just straight up disappeared from my game with no way of restoring it.\n\nThere's also a lot of things that are just badly planned and balanced. Storage is a nightmare. The tiny storage box you get at the beginning of the game is straight up the best you ever get. You cannot expand the storage. Just make more and more tiny boxes. I saw a player in a thread casually commenting that they have fifty-two storage boxes. FIFTY-TWO. There is so much you need to store in this game that it doesn't even surprise me.\n\nArguably the most important thing in the game, stamina, is also a disaster. There are recipes galore in this game offering every buff you can imagine, but almost none that give you stamina. I tried looking it up to see if later in the game we get something better, but late game players were still suggesting the almost useless berry recipe you, again, get right at the beginning of the game. One of those things gives you like 10 stamina. I'm pretty sure it takes more than 10 stamina to scavenge the just one of the easiest beginner scrap piles in the game. Seemingly the only other better option is one specific medicine you can buy in a couple of places. You cannot make it yourself, and it isn't particularly cheap.\n\nI'm also getting quests that require either immaculate timing to get done, or are literally completely impossible to do on time because getting ingredients/machines needed requires more time than is allotted. It's really frustrating to see the characters get all sad, or rub it in your face that they did it without you, when there was absolutely no way you could have completed the quest. It just straight up was not possible.\n\nI want to finish this off by saying again that the game IS really fun. I intend to keep playing it, and if you can handle a bit of frustrating jank I genuinely think it's a pretty entertaining time. But I'm really hoping that the developers will eventually address these issues, because as fun as this is, it would be a lot more fun without them.", "timestamp_created": 1700138590, "timestamp_updated": 1700138590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150218152": {"recommendationid": "150218152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048512431", "num_games_owned": 1350, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 4648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3577, "playtime_at_review": 4648, "last_played": 1700130298}, "language": "english", "review": "PROS:\n\u2022\tGAMEPLAY: at core My Time at Sandrock has simple gameplay: to advance the story you need to build X thing. But before that you need diagram for it, for X items you need Z number of materials which you can get with upgraded tools and in specific dungeon. Basically, it is a very intricate dopamine infused web which works quite well.\n\u2022\tGRAPHICS: a vast improvement over last entry My Time at Portia.\n\u2022\tSTORYLINE: I really enjoyed that writers expanded the lore about overall state of the known world. There are no promises given, but they left nice options for future games. The characters are fleshed out nicely. They all have their things, motives, and stories.\n\u2022\tVOICEACTING: Kudos to all voice actors, they did a great job.\n\nCONS:\n\u2022\tPACING: the game clearly wants you to stop and grind. Probably it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise at this kind of game, but it started getting ridiculous once I started getting 10-15 levels higher than me. I finished the game at level 43 and carried level 55 gear in inventory in hopes I will level up. The problem is that there aren\u2019t that many activities to do that. Unless you want to repeat same 3 dungeons all over again, search for some enemies in open areas or grind for materials. There are commissions too, but unfortunately a limited amount per day. \nSame pacing issues with the story. It seems like at first the scope was smaller but as they got the funds from Kickstarter they started adding more and more things. The ending feels like very long epilogue. It is better than previous game, but this could really be improved.\n\u2022\tSILENT PROTAGONIST: are we saving the resources, or the idea was that voice will break the immersion. For me it is opposite. I got used to it, but please voice for next protagonist.\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\u2022\tTECHNICAL PERFORMANCE: I have way above recommended system requirements, but last 15 hours was really a pain at times. Characters loading slightly 2-3 seconds into the cutscene, overall, longer loading times, even game crashing few times. Most of it is annoying. Nothing game breaking. And I believe these things will be fixed, but for now be cautious and have patience. Factory seems the most broken feature, but at the time of the writing there is already one fix released addressing it. I really like factory in previous game, in my mind this is a step backwards, but maybe it will be changed too.\n\u2022\tAUDIO: There are few great songs in the game.

Despite my negative review, I will keep playing it. And if you like games like Stardew Valley, you'll almost certainly like this one. The basic gameplay loop is fine - great even, if a little stale after awhile. And the story - likewise very enjoyable! The characters are, for the most part, unique and interesting and generally quite humorous. Overall I should be able to recommend this game. So why don't I?\n\nIt's the little things. Lots and lots of little things. For me, I play a game like this as a kind of escapism. I lose myself in the story and in getting to know the cast of characters - however cheesy it all might be. And in general, this game provides that better than most you might play, without the heaping dose of grim reality and tragedy you'll get from something like Baldur's Gate 3. It's a happy escapist fantasy. Until you encounter (not bugs, because I did not encounter any that were not ultimately harmless and funny) some of the poorly or lazily implemented features.\n\nObviously, you can date and marry and have kids with a good number of the characters. This is to be expected of this genre, and the process of getting to know these characters, through a variety of quests and events both focused on them and not, is quite a bit of fun. You will probably become quite invested in them. Until you finish their content and they become hollow and uninteresting shells. They don't do or say anything new or interesting past a certain point - which is to be expected, but it is exacerbated by other things as I will point out. The Dating/Hangout mini game becomes a chore because after a couple of those you will have exhausted the dialogue with a given character - and that dialogue will not update even if you are actively in a relationship or married to the character. \n\nTo make matters even worse, the story will not take any of this into account. Whether or not you are dating a given character, or married to them even, will never come up outside of the one off wedding event or when talking to that character directly to get one of their canned lines of repetitive marriage dialogue - which are cute sure enough, but you can only hear them so many times before they lose all their charm. \n\nFor a truly horrible example of how absurd this can get, at one point during the story you are to venture into a toxic environment full of extremely hostile enemies that want to kill you. All well and good, yea? Well, if you are married to one of the characters involved, that character could be pregnant at the time of this quest. This does not come up...so your fun little happy escapism is irreparably ruined because the game is now sending your pregnant wife into a life and death situation because the smallest effort was not made to actually integrate the relationship and marriage system into the story in any way. \n\nAnd speaking of pregnancy, it's hilarious - from  a male character's perspective, I do not know how it differs if you play a female character and are the one to get pregnant. You will be teleported one morning to the hospital to see your spouse holding the baby, you will be prompted to name it, pick what the child will call you, and then you will be returned home. Your spouse will be gone, already off following their preset schedule (which does not change even when you marry them by the way, they still follow the same routine as they do by default, except when it is interupted by the tasks you can choose to assign them). When you catch up to them...not a single damn mention of the baby they just pushed out. The entire system is barely implemented and it's kind of ridiculous. Harvest Moon 64 almost 30 years ago had a more robust and interesting system of marriage and children. What they've cobbled together here has the bones of something perfectly adequate, great even, but there is basically no connective tissue to bring it all together. \n\nOverall, the game is quite good for what it is, and despite my negativity there is much to enjoy. But this is a life sim game, and the quite frankly pathetic implementation of some very important systems to the success of a game in that genre - dating, marriage, and children - leave a massive gaping hole in it. Fixing these things would not even require a massive revamp of the game. Just some basic time and care to make these choices feel as impactful as they should. Lockout marriage until a point in the story where it cant create awkward situations, for example. Implement new dialogues to accurately reflect relationship changes - despite all the voice acting a significant amount of the dialogue is unvoiced, so it is not even a question of needing to record new lines. Just write more dialogue and shove it in there.", "timestamp_created": 1700076460, "timestamp_updated": 1700076460, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480656981468200684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1700215301, "developer_response": "Hey there!

I always felt like I was chasing some far away goal and always had stuff to do and people to talk to. There's no shortage of content here, and even though I stopped at the 40 hr mark, I could have easily done another 40 with the amount on offer. \nThe social system is great. It's a grind, but it's great. You can go on dates with your townspeople and I feel like the dates are actually thoughtful - you don't just ply them with gifts and everything works out - you have to plan what you want to do according to what the NPC likes to do.\n\nI loved the setting - it's such a unique setting for a life sim and it actually plays directly into the game play. It isn't just lip service. The town relies on a meagre supply of water and it *isn't* freely available so you have to plan everything around having a supply of water to power your machines. They even add layers of complexity later on as story twists put a real squeeze on the towns water supply. That's really cool. You also can't just fell every tree in sight as the environs rely on them to maintain water. So you are really scavenging from wrecks and debris and it lends the game this real desert junkyard vibe that I think works well. \n\nOn the flipside, though, I find the art style, characterisation and dialogue a LOT more cringey than in other management/life sim games. I get that a lot of these games are meant to be wholesome and kindly, it's a big part of why the genre has the appeal it has, but it doesn't work here. In Stardew Valley, it's wholesome but genuine. Here in Sandrock, everything is sickly sweet. People treat you with fawning praise that comes off as either blindly naive or painful disingenuous and as a result, I didn't really feel totally connected to any of the characters as much as I did in, say, Spiritfarer, which in terms of characterisation is best in class. So that sucks, because *quite* a lot of the game is spent talking to people. And it's a lot. A LOT. of really cheesey cringey dialogue. \n\nThis game is also afflicted with the baggage of the genre: Grinding. I really feel like the end game *has* to involve some kind of automation because there's only so much joy that can be wrung from grinding for resources and plying them into machines and manually making *everything* every single time. At the start, this is a genuinely fun pursuit as you always have goals to aim for, but the pursuit soon becomes your cage and before you know it, the game is playing you when it should be the other way around.\n\nGenerally speaking, despite these negatives, I feel like Sandrock is a great time if you know what you're getting into, but a lot of the genre's contemporaries have done this before, and maybe even better.", "timestamp_created": 1700047450, "timestamp_updated": 1700047450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150161317": {"recommendationid": "150161317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005401237", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 7777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6028, "playtime_at_review": 7240, "last_played": 1700455984}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a hard one to judge. This game is a culmination of both what I love and hate about modern video games.\n\nPros:\n* The game loop isn't bad. It's similar to the predecessor and they didn't modify it much from there. \n* The characters in the game are pretty decent and distinct. Some of them develop in unexpected ways which is neat.\n* There \"larger than life\" events that do better than what its predecessor had.\n* The conveniences later on are better than what was in its predecessor (with unfortunate caveats due to bugs).\n* A cozy quality-of-life game.\n\nCons:\n* This game is buggy to a point I'm not sure how the hell it was released like it was. Some of the bugs are similar to what I saw in early versions of its predecessor game which tells me they didn't learn much from their mistakes in implementation. I've made a list I can remember off the top of my head below.\n\n* The combat is pretty weak. I didn't pay much attention to the early access but I was hoping they'd really make the combat more interesting. Make no mistake that it's definitely better than what Portia had. There's more variety here but it's literally \"smash the X button\" when you get down to it.\n\n* After awhile, farming and mining stuff becomes repetitive which thankfully becomes easier. [strike]Unfortunately, because the Factory has such a fucked up implementation and literally doesn't work half the time, that convenience can be more irritating than helpful.[/strike] There's also no way to farm certain stuff or to get someone else to fetch it like Agate. You have to go out and spend 5-10 minutes picking them 2 at a time. This isn't as big of a deal though, you don't generally need Agate that often but for example, Flourite you do since certain items that show up on commission require it to increase rarity. The only other way to get that is through Ruin Tokens which is already expensive and time consuming to obtain....\n\n* Some commissions are a trap. It might look easy but they want increased rarity on something like a Steel Bar which requires Flourite to create which is an absolute pain in the ass to get. These commissions are never worth the gold they give (and they don't give much generally). They're there to make you feel miserable. The game should give double gold for such requests or triple gold for Rare quality items.\n\nAll that said... I've already gotten over 100 hours out of it and I'll probably finish it. I'd wait for a sale but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. There isn't really any challenge to it which kinda kills it a little bit. You can fail some stuff but you either have to try to fail it or fail it via a bug. \n\nBugs I saw while playing:\n* Literally first five minutes into the game, you'll notice that CoCo the bird fly's sideways and slow as if running into a wall. Literally shows in one of the earliest cutscenes as you start playing.\n\n* Mobs and NPCs end up your workshop seemingly lost, as if their pathing is telling them to go there for some reason and then they just literally run around doing nothing.\n\n* Soft locks are brimming in this game. They seem to be worse when you play the game for extended periods of time which brings me to...\n\n* The game has some issues when played for long periods of time. Things load slower or not at all, animations are wonkier, sound may not occur at all having you miss actually interesting voice lines.\n\n* [strike]The Factory you get later into the game is a broken mess. The UI doesn't update properly, parts of the UI doesn't work with controller for some reason, and multiple times now I've had the recycler \"production queue\" absolutely busted to where it was unusable. Things that should produce more than one of a thing, for example bullets (5 each) or copper screws (2 each), will only produce one which is a clear bug since it shouldn't take fucking 20 steel bars and 50 gunpowder to make literally 10 rifle bullets, but doing the same thing directly on a forge would give you 50.[/strike] This was fixed in latest patch of this writing.\n\n* NPCs will fall to the bottom of the map, teleport endlessly, float in the sky or just out of reach, or not be able to interact with them at all until you leave the room or restart the game even.\n\n* NPC pathing will often put them smack dab in the middle of a cutscene where they mob pile to the point you can't see anything going on anymore.\n\n* I've softlocked on a lot of scenes that want your character to automatically moved but apparently, I'm alone in this according to the forums.\n\n* I've had the planting grid get stuck in 5x5 when in 4x4 mode, then plant incorrectly. This was with the Robot: F machine. EDIT: There is a 5x5 mode later in the game but the robot isn't supposed to have it. \n\n* Quests not triggering which would then fail after time passes.\n\n* Too many events scheduled at once. I had several quests on the same day as the Day of Memories, all at 1600.  They not only won't reschedule any of them, they also will cause bugs like not letting you join the Ghost Hunting event.\n\n* Probably more I'm not thinking of or too small of a bug to care.", "timestamp_created": 1700043387, "timestamp_updated": 1700209438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150157943": {"recommendationid": "150157943", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964167727", "num_games_owned": 1295, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 5832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4754, "playtime_at_review": 5832, "last_played": 1700036512}, "language": "english", "review": "truly an amazing adventure i can recommend to anyone who likes farming/town building games \nits one of a kind", "timestamp_created": 1700036577, "timestamp_updated": 1700036577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150156412": {"recommendationid": "150156412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218257345", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2032, "playtime_at_review": 1442, "last_played": 1700377286}, "language": "english", "review": "The best, chillest game ever!", "timestamp_created": 1700033150, "timestamp_updated": 1700033150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150155118": {"recommendationid": "150155118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067896045", "num_games_owned": 800, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 3968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3968, "playtime_at_review": 1458, "last_played": 1700466539}, "language": "english", "review": "I dont know if this game is just more fleshed out or something but I got really bored with My time at Portia and this one I havent at all.

I have not even finished the game yet, but I wanted to post an honest and informative review while the game is at the height of attention. This is by far the #1 game in the genre for me. I normally do short and sweet reviews, but for a game like this I want to go over some of the important aspects of it that may make or break the players experience. So let me explain the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\n[b]The Good[/b]:\n-Outstanding amount of content. You can see by my playtime that I have put in a significant amount of time. I have not even finished the main story yet, and I am not actually sure how close I am to the end. There is plenty of upgrades, levels, npc content, and building/farming to be done here\n\n-You can have a farm with plants, chickens, buffalo, bunnies, and mounts\n\n-There are about 20 or so romance-able NPC's, all with their own character growth and story arcs along side the main story. Some of them are very well done and interesting while others are not quite as fleshed out, but still enjoyable\n\n-Combat in the game is quick-paced hack-n-slash shoot-em-up style. There are \"dungeons\" to breeze through where you can get treasure, materials, and glory\n\n-Festivals are a lot of fun. You unlock more festivals as the game progresses and there are fun little mini games and unique events for each one of them.\n\n-Character creation is a bit similar to My Time at Portia and there are a lot of lore-friendly outfits and accessories you can use to personalize your builder. The hairstyles and coloring can be customized quite a bit to give you a unique look as well\n\n-You can go on dates and hangout with the friends you meet in town, you can play mini games in an arcade and even Mahjong at a later portion of the game.\n\n-Progression is slow but it feels great. Every new house and machine upgrade you get feels like an achievement. You can upgrade your mounts, raise animals, have a huge farm, and it all feels earned. Once you get more levels for your workshop and character and progress the main story you can automate collection of resources to help your progression quite a bit.\n\n-The developers are awesome and are constantly replying to concerns and bug reports in the forums, as well as trying to improve the game.\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]:\n-Progression is slow. I know I stated this above, but people with not a lot of time on their hands may feel that they are not getting anywhere. A lot of this probably has a lot to do with how fast you decide to progress time. You can choose anywhere from 0.6x-3.0 time progression speed, and I believe that can have an impact on the pace of the game and how quickly it goes by. I like to take things slow and experience everything the game has to offer, so I have it set at 0.6.\n\n-Stamina and time can be hard to manage at first. You may feel a struggle early game trying to get the resources you need and finishing missions on time. This caveat goes away after getting some levels and experience under your belt. A lot of people feel a struggle at the beginning. Taking the game slow is a good idea at the beginning until you get used to it.\n\n-Certain resources are very hard to get such as electronics, certain plants, trees, or animal resources. Some of this stuff you need for progression but it is hard or impossible to automate in any way at the beginning. When you do commissions/missions for townsfolk, if you are not careful then you won't be able to complete them on time. This is why it is good to take it slow at the beginning and learn the ins-and-outs. This adds to early game struggle and gives a sense of not getting anywhere.\n\n-Some of the romance-able NPC's don't really have much character development or story missions, decreasing their interesting aspect.\n\n-The house building/decorating leaves much to be desired. It is difficult to place objects or know what objects to place in certain circumstances. The building UI is clunky and not user friendly. It can be struggle to get a look that you like. There are mismatched patterns or just plain ugly ones when making roofs or rooms. They honestly should have hired a color expert or interior decorator because some combinations of design can be atrocious. This part of the game is passable and you can get something that you are satisfied with, but it could take some workaround.\n\n-Workshop upgrades are incredibly expensive, to the point where you have to grind money for a long time to get room for all of the workshop add-ons, machines, and other goodies. It took me a good month of in game time to get an upgrade that would give me enough building space to extend my house because of how much money it was to get it. This part of the game feels a bit unbalanced, especially with how much money you will be spending elsewhere.\n\n[b]The Ugly[/b]\n-This game is Bethesda level buggy as of right now. I am not even remotely exaggerating. There are issues with NPC's disappearing out of nowhere, floating mounts that you can't ride because they are stuck in the air, a visual bug that messes with some resource contracts, unclear missions markers or explanations etc.\n\n-Some missions have a timer on them. So you need to complete it in a certain number of days. There are several missions that you will fail for no reason at all with no in-game timer attached to them. These missions show no sign and give no hint of a fail-trigger, but if you don't do them then you will fail them at some point for what seems like no reason. I have had this happen a few times. This is usually with side missions. \n\n-You need to save a lot. There are some potentially game breaking bugs and missions you can screw up through no fault of your own, as stated above. It is a good idea to have several hard saves just in case something undesirable happens that messes up your progress with missions, npc's, or other aspects.\n\n-The game does not run well sometimes. I get around ~60 FPS pretty consistently, but certain areas, scenes, or events can cause huge framerate drops to as low as 15 FPS, and I have had the game crash on me once. Some people report even worse performance, but for me it is tolerable. I have a pretty decent gaming computer. I can run Cyberpunk on max with a constant 60-70 FPS, and this game performs slightly worse in certain cases. I will say that it seems they have ironed out some of this in the last week or so since my performance seems to have improved over the last couple days. In particular, when the train comes into town is one of the points where I get an FPS drop to 15, but earlier today it did not drop when the train came in.\n\nThe game is by no means perfect, but it is my favorite game in the genre. If you liked Portia or games like Stardew Valley, Coral Island, or any other popular sim games like this, then you will probably love this one. The developers are constantly looking at feedback and improving the game, so I am almost positive all of the negatives I pointed out will be fixed at some point in the future. They have already been actively releasing post-launch updates and they even intend to add more content eventually from what I have read. The developers and this game have my full confidence and support!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1699978392, "timestamp_updated": 1699978392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150120996": {"recommendationid": "150120996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107815997", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8289, "playtime_at_review": 4776, "last_played": 1700500303}, "language": "english", "review": "fun and a good chill game", "timestamp_created": 1699977533, "timestamp_updated": 1699977533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150120383": {"recommendationid": "150120383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086341131", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1281, "playtime_at_review": 8348, "last_played": 1699978940}, "language": "english", "review": "Ich liebe dieses Spiel, ich habe auch schon My Time At Portia gespielt und es macht wirklich Spa\u00df.

It was only a matter of when the game would come out of Early Access to claim its crown.\n\nNow then, on to WHY this game is, as of this writing, my 6th most-played title in terms of hours on my Steam account.\n\nIt's basically everything from My Time at Portia, but improved upon and made better in every possible way. The world is bigger, the building mechanics refined to a visible-from-space shine, the action RPG story fleshed out in a way that makes it the primary driver of gameplay rather than purely a framing device.\n\nIndeed, this is less a cozy game with action-RPG elements and more a reimagining of the action RPG formula where cozy game mechanics are the primary driver of progression. The genres blend seamlessly in a way that they never have before\u2014looking at you, Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West and every Ubisoft game, where the crafting is tedious and feels unnecessary.\n\nBut at the same time, this game also has a cozy soul. If you're played any Harvest Moon-like, the life sim elements are exactly what you want them to be and then some. Building relationships with villagers, romance, family life, it's all there with plenty of choices and some remarkably well-written relationship and character backstory dialogue. There are just so many ways to get a villager's friendship up compared to, say, Stardew Valley's more traditional talk-and-gift approach, and with the anti-frustration feature of not having to talk to every villager every day just to keep their relationship level from backsliding.\n\nSpeaking of anti-frustration features, there are plenty more in this game as well. None of the main story quests are timed; complete them at your leisure. Get overleveled if the combat's not your strong suit. Rush the main story quests to unlock more of the crafting recipes if that's your jam. Speedrunners and challenge runners? Go to town, the game's got plenty of measurable ways to keep score. \n\nAlmost none of the sidequests are timed. If you unlock them too fast, as happens when you're powering through the main quest and hitting every character's sidequest trigger faster than you can bang them out, well, take a step back and take your time. The devs listened to players during the Early Access stage of the process and took the most common frustration\u2014players felt rushed\u2014out of the game. You want to complete them as fast as possible, nothing's stopping you. But it all fits in with the overarching theme of well-camouflaged accessibility that never feels like it's being dumbed down.\n\nAs for the action and combat in the action RPG, well, the devs know they're not From Software. This isn't going to challenge anyone with a firm grounding in action games. You can overpower just about anything in the game because the devs have consciously avoided the Bethesda syndrome of level-scaling enemies. Well, with one exception\u2014going too far afield in a sandstorm is going to surprise you the first time you run into high-level versions of basic enemies\u2014but even that is a smart stylistic choice that makes sandstorms feel appropriately dangerous and threatening for a game set against the backdrop of a desert environment with a strong \"green aesop\" running through the main story.\n\nIs the game perfect? Well, no, no game is perfect, not even games that are otherwise among the greatest of all time (I say this as someone who loved everything about Red Dead Redemption 2 except for the on-rails quest design, for example.)\n\nFor one thing, the fishing minigame is one of the weakest I've seen in this genre. It's simplistic and repetitive and offers almost no challenge and very little reason to even engage with it beyond a couple of cooking recipes. This is a shame, especially since Portia's fishing minigame was quite fun and other games like Stardew, Animal Crossing (and Dinkum, which cribs heavily from it), and even Red Dead 2 have great outdoorsman-style fishing gameplay.\n\nIn addition, there are a couple of dungeons in the midgame that have a jarring tonal shift toward platformer gameplay. Thankfully the devs refined it a bit after its initial introduction; jumps are more forgiving, there's plenty of \"coyote time\" with ledges, and there's the option to skip the trickiest segments if you fail them enough times, but for a game that otherwise has good dungeon design, there's a heavy \"why, devs?\" when playing the two dungeons in question.\n\nBut those are minor quibbles in a game that is otherwise the absolute apex of the cozy game genre with one heck of a story RPG to go with it.\n\nAbsolutely, by miles, my 2023 Game of the Year. 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1699951859, "timestamp_updated": 1699951859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150103239": {"recommendationid": "150103239", "author": {"steamid": "76561199474107991", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3079, "playtime_at_review": 1562, "last_played": 1700457273}, "language": "english", "review": "its fun and not too simple, Unsuur is a lil menace in the oddest way", "timestamp_created": 1699947820, "timestamp_updated": 1699947820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150103174": {"recommendationid": "150103174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001026200", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 5796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3955, "playtime_at_review": 4548, "last_played": 1700460827}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid sequel.

It's the equivalent of saying, \"Guy walks outside\" Oh my gosh... he really did walk outside! SPOILERSSS. I'm confident it wouldn't be the thing that kept me out of heaven by saying no spoilers...\n\nIf you liked My Time at Portia, you'll like this one. The controls are  basically the same with some minor differences that take getting used to. Key difference I find AMAZING is that your storage is linked to your inventory when building, as well as most cases when giving gifts or completing quests. I found one instance where I couldn't give something in my storage and it's probably a bug. If a developer ever reads this, it was when one of the NPC's was craving a \"Copper Plate\" I had to have it physically on me to give in that case... or maybe I'm dumb and haven't realized that all gifts must be in inventory to give and that's just a feature. In other words you don't need to spend hours organizing your storage... just throw it in and call it a day (except for clothes you want to keep... that's worth putting in it's own storage... everything else? Who cares?)\n\nRELIC HUNTING... is more exciting... Maybe some won't like the change but I especially love it. Instead of a giant cube room it's multiple floors of some building or something, and there are specific items you can get per floor. It makes it less of a \"FIND ONE OF 50 relics which each have 2-7 pieces in this one giant room! Didn't find them? Well then do it all over again!\" Now it's more like 5 relics per floor in a designed building that has multiple floors and start from whichever floor you want so long as you've gone deep enough to find the entrance to that floor. Huge improvement in my book.\n\nCOMBAT... I can't say about all the weapons... I started with the daggers tried, the others once, I love the daggers.... call me Thorfin. \n\nCombat is pretty similar to the old game, but just better. From Armor breaking/staggering, to varying stats on the same item because of it's quality, which can range from low, to perfect, and then there's rare, which adds some cool features.... whether it's crafting, buying or finding. the items are all much more exciting in this game.\n\nI was DISAPPOINTED.... that everything feels mostly the same as the original game, but happy it's better. You're basically getting the same game but part two. \n\nTHE DIALOGUE is mostly skipable, with the occasional choose your response, in which cases I regret not reading the dialogue... buuuut 95% of the time... totally skipable. Unless I'm in a reading mood, I find it average, and occasionally good.\n\nCUT SCENES.... are extremely lacking... it's like a low quality first time actor playing a major roll in a lead film, and the director says after each scene, \"Cut.. that's a wrap... send it to production.\" When they should've said, \"CUT! THAT SUCKS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING! You're entering a scene where all the monsters are already gone, you've just barely shown up, and then you do a front roll into the room... from the middle of the room... you then aim your pistol, stand up, smile doing a finger spin with the pistol... catch it, blow the smoke off the tip of the pistol, when there is no smoke, because you haven't fired a single shot?... Are you stupid? did you take acting lessons from Stupid School? Did you graduate top of your stupid class with stupid honors? BECAUSE THAT WAS PRETTY STUPID!\"\n\nNow if they added a character to come in and say those exact words to that silly dude who did all those things... Then it would've been hilarious, and we all would've understood... that's the stupid guy... but no, every cut scene is pretty much like that.\n\nI LOVE THE GAME... plenty to make fun of, and critique, but that doesn't stop me from loving it. Leave a comment/question if you have any specific inquiries.\n\nDLC WORTH IT?..... You aren't missing anything by not buying any of the DLC items... sure they'll give you a nice head start, but even though I had them I found myself not using any of them because I like starting a game with nothing and then building up to something awesome. If you're the same, save yourself a few bucks, otherwise if you just want some gear for some different looks, then maybe you'll like it.\n\nCHARACTER CREATION.... Well at least you won't look like you have down syndrome in the game... unless that's what you're going for I'M SURE YOU CAN PULL IT OFF!!! There is a major improvement on the quality of character in the creation tab... BUT I JUST WANT MORE!!! \n\nYou really don't have a lot of options, and they don't leave you thinking, \"THAT CHARACTER I MADE LOOKS SO BAD A!!!\" It's more of a, \"Well... I guess that's as good as it gets.\" I liked how mine turned out, but it took 3 hours of messing around with every possibility, starting and deleting 3 games (the character never looks exactly the same in the game play)...before I finally got to \"MY GUY LOOKS REALLY KIND OF OKAY!\"\n\n(example... i put lipstic and changed the coloring on my guy to make him look like he had actual lips... not feminine lips... just dude lips...

If the actors have really thick native accents, don't tell them to sound country! It doesn't work! Just have them speak in their native accent, it sounds fine and doesn't break immersion in a post calamity fantasy world. \n- Do one more quality pass over your writing and dialogue, possibly with a native English speaker. There's some easy mistakes in the text/speech that can cause a lot of confusion. \n- Fix the pop-in of assets! Even if you have to force another second of load time for the player. I've gotten stuck in things that haven't appeared yet - especially on holidays. \n- Don't automatically have the player start chopping a tree that they shouldn't be chopping! I don't want to be punished in game for doing something that I didn't mean to do in the first place. \n- Allow calendar reminders for NPC Birthdays. \n- MORE SANDSTORMS! They should damage shops and buildings, allowing for the builder to take on special commissions to repair them for temporary discounts. \n- Warn players further in advance that quests are going to expire... \n- Not everyone should get along. Perhaps consider in the future that becoming friends with some people, means making enemies of others. Make the relationship meters less linear.

Relationships with the NPCs is also good. The town is beautiful.\n\nThe bad part is combat, which lacks any kind of challenge and doesn't feel good. You level up your character by doing pretty much anything and this automatically increases your damage significantly. This meant that once I started the first combat oriented mission of the campaign, I was already 10 levels above the enemies and it felt very boring. Aside that, I think the main issue is that combat feels very floaty and has no weight. The sound effects animations when hitting enemies are lackluster, making it feel very boring to hit enemies.\n\nStages for exploration are very repetitive copy paste of enviroments and lack any true interesting parts or puzzles.\n\nInventory management is also another small issue, since there's tons of different items, it gets hard to organize them all, specially playing on controller.\n\nOverall it's a pretty decent game, with much potential if they fix combat and level scaling.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1699901109, "timestamp_updated": 1699901109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

(restarting the game doesn't really work, skipping day or sometime going in and out of an interior can work)\n\nThe storyline is.. surprising for this type of game but cool overall. The 2/3rd of the game was pretty smooth with quest almost everyday guiding you and providing you goals to go forward. \nWhen you've done almost all side content, the game consist of sleeping to trigger main events. (after 70h+ for me.) So i'm starting to get tired of it even tho' i have still a few things to do.\n\nThe game can be really immersive if you're into this kind of game. Socializing and housing is nice. \nStill wasn't able to romance the character of my choice after 120h playtime. I don't know why but the person was constantly refusing the necklace even tho the NPC is indicated as a possible bachelor.

I love the Stardew genre of games though and the initial grid didn't deter me. I'm now 78 hours in and I can safely say this game is an absolute gem. It has everything you'd expect in a game like this, tool progression, a passable combat system, a modest tech tree and progressive efficiency gains, but there are a few things that put it above the rest of the competition within this genre.\n\n1. Inventory management is an absolute breeze. When crafting and turning in quests you have access to every item in every chest that you own. Furthermore, when you go to any chest in your base to deposit items after a day of gathering, you can press a single button to automatically deposit all like-items into stacks across all of your chests. This game has completely solved the inventory management issue that bogs down mid and late-game in this genre and for that I tip my hat.\n\n2. The writing in this game is phenomenal! The story is pretty bonkers and while being pretty cutesy and family friendly, crams in a lot of humor and some genuinely wild twists and turns. This game isn't high-drama, but it's just so much fun that I can't recommend it enough. The characters are also very well-written and unique.\n\n3. The art design for this game is very unique and I think it'll age fairly well. The customization options you get on your character are pretty fun. I like seeing what other people made their avatars to look like. You also get an outfit tab separate from your equipment tab so you have total freedom to customize your look.\n\nSo all that said, there are a few cons that whittle this game down from being perfect to being in the 9/10 bracket.\n\n1. The map is fairly limited in size. You'll spend a lot of time going back and forth through the same areas for dozens of hours.\n\n2. The game is pretty grindy if you're looking to upgrade your farm to the largest possible size. It requires an absolutely diabolical amount of money and there aren't a lot of ways to make said money as easily as you can in Stardew Valley. There's a barn and coop structure that you can build, but they aren't very good revenue sources; the same can be said about farming. The real way to make money in this game is to fulfill a limited amount of crafting requests each day and then just grind the mines over and over. I wish there were more options for money making or that the farm plot upgrades were cheaper.\n\nOverall I really like this game and recommend it strongly if you're a fan of this genre.

The big difference I noticed right off was that you have to build & populate the town in multiplayer while most of the towns buildings & populous are already there in single.\n\nWhile it's a really fun game in multiplayer, it is very much a grind.  It took the 2 of us around 60 hours to get every building built & upgraded so if you find grind tedious, this might not be the game for you.  I found the grind tolerable because it's mixed in with other content such as dungeons, farming, caring for pets & mounts, crafting, exploring, events, house/workshop building and story line.  The best feature of multiplayer is that when you set up a multiplayer game, it's just like renting your own server except it costs you nothing.  You can have the game match you with other players or start a new town and chose to let randoms in or set it to invite only.  When you have players join, unlike many other game, you do not have to be online for them to log in and play.  For the amount of play time and content you'll get out of this game, I think the price tag is a fare price but that will be up to you to determine.

It improves on most parts while only keeping a few weaknesses it's predecessor had. To keep it short:\n\n+Runs better\n+No more Inventory Management (Your Machines automatically use Items from your chests, and you can scroll through all chests at once), BUT it still keeps the inventory when gifting items/donating to the museum (Why though? Please fix this)\n+An interesting Story (It's nothing groundbreaking, but it keeps you hooked), however the story has 2 Plotlines and the 2nd one keeps dragging on for just a bit too long imo (If the pacing was improved, a solid 10 hours of gametime could be cut, which would fix this imo)\n+Improved overall gameplay (Combat is better, Mines are now actually designed instead of randomly generated, big enemy variety, several weapon options)\n+Better cast (I disliked it more in the first few hours, but the more time i put into it, the more i grew to prefer it over the first cast), additionally, the game doesnt shy from adding or taking away characters halfway through the story, keeping the cast fresh\n+Improved Farming, Improved Pet Keeping, Improved Mount-System and unlockable options to modify your house and workshop from home (no more running to the Upgrade-store)\n\n~New Building System for Housing. Originally i liked it a lot, but its very shallow. The Lack of Options to build as well as the lack of forms for building really put a dent into this for me (No Triangles, Round houses etc.) AND the Factory and Greenhouse also got worked into this and are now basically quadratic blocks with little to no customization, so they look worse like the old versions but also dont improve on them gameplaywise.\n~Bigger Focus on Socializing - the Game has a lot of small quests which tell you stories about the individual characters, their relationships with each others and their backstories. I put it in mixed because some people prefer the core gameplay loop, but if you enjoy the social-part, this puts games like SDV in the dust\n~Bigger Focus on Combat and Platforming - I mentioned earlier that Sandrock improved on Combat. However, it's still not good. You can work with it, it does what it has to do, but thats it. And focusing a big part of the story on the workable combat and clunky Platforming simply doesnt work and is frustrating. Personally, those were the most dreadful parts, despite the devs working some of the best ideas into them.\n\n-All those Nitpicks i had lead to me feeling like the game was simply not quite finished. It reminded me a lot of Baldurs Gate 3, where the start was so well thought through and everything worked perfectly but as you got into the later parts of the game it starts to feel as if they didnt work it through enough.\n-Same goes for Performance. The game runs overall a lot better than portia, but as you get into the later parts of the game, you get more bugs, such as textures not loading, small lagspikes and characters not working or completely disappearing.\n\nOverall i give Sandrock a 7/10. If they fix the bugs and improve on the factory and greenhouse the game can easily become an 8-9/10 and one of the strongest condenders in the Genre, next to Stardew Valley.", "timestamp_created": 1699782466, "timestamp_updated": 1699782466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149989583": {"recommendationid": "149989583", "author": {"steamid": "76561199063632689", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3442, "playtime_at_review": 1919, "last_played": 1700419561}, "language": "english", "review": "pro", "timestamp_created": 1699780216, "timestamp_updated": 1699780216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149985582": {"recommendationid": "149985582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044102032", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6523, "playtime_at_review": 4741, "last_played": 1700451115}, "language": "english", "review": "cozy", "timestamp_created": 1699773926, "timestamp_updated": 1699773926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149985540": {"recommendationid": "149985540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089383357", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1681, "playtime_at_review": 3513, "last_played": 1700325246}, "language": "english", "review": "I just love seeing how far this game has come! \nIt's really beautifully done and you can see the effort of the Devs behind it all. \nI loved the previous game and this one is no different! \nThere are a few things I would still like to see improved but I'll just wait to see whats next :D\nAmazing work and story! \n~Conserve Water!~", "timestamp_created": 1699773874, "timestamp_updated": 1699773874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149983804": {"recommendationid": "149983804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198814653434", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2496, "playtime_at_review": 16791, "last_played": 1700376376}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommend, this game rivals my all time favorite Stardew Valley.

If you're a return player from Portia, I can confirm to you that Sandrock is a massive upgrade in almost all aspects! If you have never played a game in the My Time at series, don't worry! You absolutely do not have to play Portia to enjoy Sandrock! After over 200 hours of game play, here's my major takeaways ~ [/h3]\n\n[u] The Great ~ [/u] \n\n[b] The Story Line [/b]\n- Sandrock has a really great main story quest line, with enough twist and turns to keep you interested and immersed. It truly was a pleasure to play through it! There's a good mix of resource gathering, social aspects, combat, farming, and advancement required that keeps you motivated to continue grinding towards completion. Also, if you're a return player from Portia, I personally believe that Sandrock has a better story line, and has increased difficulty.\n[b] The Characters [/b]\n- Wow! Sandrock truly has some very colorful characters! Without giving anything away, these side characters have a variety of personalities that are genuinely fun to interact with. In a lot of other games from this genre I tend to stop talking to a lot of the NPCs around town, but I actually like hearing what the characters in Sandrock have to say! It also helps that every character is given new unique dialogue after progress in the story is made, so they're not just constantly spouting the same lines all the time, regardless of development. There's a lot of great romance options as well, with there being someone for everyone. \n[b] The Dialogue [/b]\n- There's no other way to say this ~ this game just has straight up hilarious lines! From a farmer who's a part-time conspiracy theorist to a rock obsessed wannabe deputy, there's no shortage of great lines from the characters around the game. The dialogue also makes you want to befriend more of the citizens to see their extra events because of how hilarious they can be. Your player character can even give some golden one-liners as the game progresses! \n[b] The Grind [/b] \n- You really have to get involved in all aspects of the game when playing. You're going to need a lot of wood to complete projects, I mean, you are a builder. However, Sandrock is desolate and cutting down trees and cacti is a big no-no. This means you have to cut down tiny bushes, dead logs, etc. which do not give you a lot of resources, meaning you've got to keep at the grind! Also, as you unlock more areas and more of the story, you find yourself having to go back to previous ruins/areas in order to get different types of materials, as they're not in the same place. Don't forget that water powers all of your machines, so you have to keep your tank full in the middle of the desert! \n\n[u] The Lacking~ [/u]\n\n[b] The Family Issue [/b]\n- In short, because there's so many elements in Sandrock, they eventually fizzle out in unsatisfactory ways. A good example can be seen with married and family life, which is just not fleshed out enough. Considering characters around the game continuously sing praises towards your character, and comment on the various things going on around, it's strange that basically nobody acknowledges your spouse and children. So far, there's no family events, and once your children exit the baby stage, you literally never see them interact with anyone, including your spouse. They wake up and essentially go to one place (the train station) for the entire day.  It would've been nice to have them as actual members of the town, with their own events as they age, and a routine that mimics other NPCs. As for your spouse, the married events currently in game are very boring and out of place for some characters. I would really love to see married life and family life be more fleshed out in the future, whether in another My Time game, or in an expansion/update! I would rather have less romance options and just one child if that means that the additional content that comes with them would be stronger. \n[b] Character Favoritism + Strange Depth [/b]\n- It's very obvious that, because of fan reception, some characters are more favored than others. By this I mean that they have way more content. Take Fang and Logan as an example. Both characters are fan favorites, and they have some really cool events! These events also work really well with what has been presented with their characters, which gives not only their characters, but the game, more depth. It really makes you believe that they had a life before you, and have a life despite you. I suppose this makes me more critical of the other characters in the game. Director Qi is a good example of this. You actually get to know so much about his character! For example, he's the grandson of a successful scientist who appears to be very strict, his parent's had more \"lowly\" jobs in comparison and Qi appears to sort of look down on them, and he even states that his parents were shocked to find out that you exist (if you romance him), and that when he was younger he calculated that there was only a 3.14% chance of him finding love. These all combine to create such an interesting character, and gives you a plethora of ideas of how his character will/can progress. However, despite these tidbits that you can gather, that's basically it. His character, as well as a large portion of characters in the game, plateau. This is what I mean about strange depth, it's like they had more planned for certain characters, and it just never came to fruition. I was so certain when romancing Qi's character that there was going to be some really cool events regarding his past, him falling in love with you, having children of his own, etc., and it just never happened. It honestly was a big disappointment because I saw all the makings of a great side story for a lot of the romance-able characters, but it's just not there. \n\n[h3] In conclusion, I honestly feel like I have so much more to say, which isn't surprising considering how much I loved the game. Additionally, I would say that because I love the game and series so much I am probably more critical of it in certain ways! I think that's truly the hallmark sign of a great game, liking it so much that you want to make certain changes to perfect it! All in all, Sandrock was truly an amazing experience and I would recommend it to all lovers of the genre. However, keep in mind that there are going to be aspects of the game that will leave you frustrated. These frustrations, at least for me, have a lot to do with the fact that I just want more! Keep it up devs! You're doing great sweeties, and the improvement from Portia is MASSIVE!

Much has been made of the voiceover issues with this game, so I'll bypass those, other than to add that changing the voiceover artist for later updates compounded the issue.\n\nIt's less clunky (although arguable less realistic, as a consequence) than its predecessor, My Time at Portia, which may make for a less than satisfying experience for anyone who chooses to play that game after this one. The characters in Sandrock are less bobble-headed, too, which is an improvement. Portia and Sandrock happen in a simultaneous timelime, which leads to some quietly-amusing references to, effectively, your Portia character at points during Sandrock, another reason to consider playing Portia first.\n\nOf the five bachelors I romanced, three of them exhibited behaviour that, in real life, should set major alarm bells ringing, which is quite concerning. A couple of the NPCs are genuinely unlikeable, which is fine and reflective of real life; but I found myself resenting completing lucrative contracts for one of them by late game, as their relationship with me continued to increase even as my loathing of them grew.\n\nAs I did play this through early release, some things may have changed by full release, but a few niggly annoyances stood out: at times, lucrative commissions for machinery would appear on the commission board; but without having any in-game ability to know what was required to complete construction, it was quite frustrating to accept these commissions, research the manufacturing plans, discover you needed more advanced equipment yourself, research that, then find that you needed components you either didn't have materials for, or didn't have the ability to make. In one instance, the 'base' instructions for making the refined material I needed to make one component didn't even become available until nearly two months after I'd failed the commission. If the capacity to complete the commission doesn't exist, don't make it available.\n\nSecondly, there were times when it became impossible to complete tasks because the final act clashed with some other event. Some of these may have since been resolved. In a related annoyance, there are times when the PC wakes up with awareness of events it is literally impossible for them to have any knowledge of. Often this is minor: calendar events added on rising in the morning that are explained when mail is read. Occasionally, however, these are quite significant. Just as bed, there are some events involving NPCs that clearly acknowledge the passage of a significant period of time (a minimum two weeks would be essential in one case), yet those events conclude within a day or so. Then there is the issue of being 'transported' to major events when you get up. On one occasion, running back home after such an event, I encountered a minor task simply by talking with an NPC that I had no means of answering because the task was outlined in a letter I hadn't yet had a chance to read. More concerningly, the non-committal answer I gave may have broken the character, who never moved from the spot I encountered him for the remainder of the game, unless needed elsewhere.\n\nThe nanny-nag that says \"You can't use that possibly rude word!\" when naming things in single-player is both ludicrous and offensive: I'm an adult, not six years old, and I can make my own decisions. If it's important that any vaguely-implied rudeness must be leapt on with extreme prejudice, then I would suggest that eliminating toxic behaviours from a multitude of NPCs would be a better use of censorship - especially if (and I am forced to assume that this must be the case) the game makers are trying to avoid corrupting sweet childish innocence.\n\nSimilarly, an in-game swimwear fashion show basically designed to sell DLCs is both sexist and cowardly in dressing the female models in bikins and the males in shorts. The game designers may have jumped on the 'It's okay to be gay\" bandwagon; but their moral code is severely lacking in other areas (most particularly regarding toxic behaviours).\n\nOne in-game shop has a link to actual character figurines on Amazon: if you follow the link you find that you're being asked to pay an offensively-large amount of money for a blind-box figurine, so that's a definitive 'No' on both counts. Still, that annoyance is easily-avoided, although it does make me less-inclined to consider buying other Pathea Games products, up to and including DLCs, so they may like to rethink their approach.\n\nYes, I have concentrated on the negatives in this review. On the positive side, the game is immensely-playable. For an obsessive such as me, there is always something to do, with the essential wait-times scattered throughout the game usually not too much of a trial. Some NPCs are clearly on the autism spectrum, and this is treated respectfully (albeit occasionally with not-unreasonable impatience) by other NPCs and player choices, which is to be commended. Apart from some built-in sexism, the character design is generally appealing, and the capacity to 'hide the hat' via the settings is appreciated: having put a lot of effort into designing my character, I like being able to see them. The storylines are often engaging, although I wish the character-based relationship-building tasks had a time expiry if unselected, because having them sit constantly on the map when I have no interest in following them through is annoying.\n\nIn summary, an enjoyable, very playable game with a number of flaws, some of them significant.", "timestamp_created": 1699746104, "timestamp_updated": 1699746104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925341129302979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149966977": {"recommendationid": "149966977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350652889", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1442, "playtime_at_review": 1264, "last_played": 1699844776}, "language": "english", "review": "Good quality of life fetchers", "timestamp_created": 1699745214, "timestamp_updated": 1699745214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149966584": {"recommendationid": "149966584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080138672", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1345, "playtime_at_review": 2937, "last_played": 1699738711}, "language": "english", "review": "The multiplayer isnt on par with the singleplayer yet, but a friend and I still got 48 hours of gameplay out of it and we will return when more content is added", "timestamp_created": 1699744629, "timestamp_updated": 1699744629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149964799": {"recommendationid": "149964799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006570456", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 195, "playtime_at_review": 673, "last_played": 1699739895}, "language": "english", "review": "The four players per town multiplayer is an interesting idea.

The interaction system is fine, and the crafting system is basically identical. Most of the game is good (hence my recent post-release play of ~90 hours (~20hrs was during the beta)). The fishing is SO much better in MTAS, it's a great improvement.\n\nHowever, as the game goes on, more and more bugs arise. I've found that the game starts to chug after long play sessions (5+hrs) and needs to be restarted just to transition between scenes more smoothly. I've had several days where the game just hangs because when you leave your house in the morning it's supposed to cut to a cutscene, but the cutscene doesn't start, and so the game just sits on a black screen. Sometimes restarting the game helped, otherwise I had to restart my computer (this indicates that MTAS isn't releasing resources it finished using).\n\nOn the non-bugs front: the dialogue is often just bad. While I don't mean characters like Unsuur who are just intentionally odd (and pretty funny), the entire Bronco the Kid arc is just immensely painful to play through. I appreciate that this was probably attempting to be silly, it's just a conversation that actual humans would never have with each other.\n\nThere are a LOT of \"popins\" = graphics that just 'pop' into existence, but should have been there beforehand. Exiting a building (eg the Museum) leaves you standing outside an empty lot until the game loads in the building. This is not a modern FPS, a quick look at the sceenshots will quickly show that the graphics in this game are very basic, no DLSS in sight. Yet buildings (and people) are often loaded in very slowly, taking 2-3 seconds to fully load each time you fast travel. This seems small until you realise that you will be fast travelling multiple times per day, every day, so this issue is constantly in your face.\n\nNPCs don't exist in the world. Or rather, they do until they need to be somewhere else, and then they teleport. One of the things that I enjoyed in MTAP was watching the townsfolk sprint across town to get to a gathering. In addition to being fun to watch, it also meant you could intercept them during their schedule to interact with them. This largely doesn't happen any more, they're simply teleported to where they need to be. This, frankly, is just absolute garbage, and leads to a bunch of issues.\n\nAn example: Heidi and I are married in the game, and I have a quest to give her an item. According to my map, she's at the game centre, so I hop on my horse and head over there. As I approach the games centre, the quest marker jumps back to my workshop: she's there to pick up all the completed items from my machine. So I turnaround and head back to my workshop. As I pass the train station, the quest marker jumps *back* to the game centre: Heidi finished her workshop tasks, and her schedule has her at the games centre so she teleports again.\n\nIn MTAP, I would have met Heidi on her way, but in MTAS it's impossible.\n\nIn addition to that, NPCs will just randomly teleport around. If you hang around the main square in front of the town hall, Justice and Trudy will just randomly materialise there. This is an entirely reasonable thing to do if NPCs get stuck on objects, but 1) it's happening all the goddamn time, and 2) Coco gets stuck on objects in my workshop all the time, yet never teleports.\n\nThis is before we talk about a game-breaking bug that has halted my current play. Two events were supposed to occur on two different days, but the first didn't trigger on the correct day, so now they've both blended and are happening at the same time. This has caused the game to lose its sh~t, and spin my camera out into the desert, where it just sits and ignores all input from me.\n\nAll in all, this game is riddled with bugs, and has serious foundational flaws in its design. I bought this game in early access on the strength of MTAP, and (frankly) I regret doing so.\n\nEdited to respond to Dev comment: it *is* installed on an SSD. You seem to be saying that it's even worse on an HDD.....\n\nEdit 2: the gamebreaking bug was fixed in the Nov 16 patch.

As for how much things there is to do in the game, the only answer is YES. After 30hrs in, I still never run out of things to do, super addicting. \n\nCombat is fairly simple and suit a game like this, where building and developing your town is the main goal. dungeons are pretty fun to go through, the bosses have mechanics and not just a mob with large hp pool which was surprising as well. However, most fights is just a stat fight (whether you have enough stats/heals), dodging doesnt feel that important in the game and it doesnt even feel rewarding to dodge attacks as you can just tank through everything anyways with enough stats and heals and kill the mob faster. However, It is understandable as it is a rather casual friendly game. However if the devs decide to make the combat more interactive rather than a stat fight in the future, I am all for it. Also guns are fun and all, needing to use ADS to shoot is not fantastic.\n\nLast and the biggest selling point for me, dedicated servers.

Especially when you start upgrading the combat skills, getting more combos, getting the flow of the enemy actions and dodging and timing strikes, while not particularly profound, still feels enjoyable and far more engaging than the previous games and others in the same genre I've experienced. It feels simple enough though that even if you're not really playing this game to partake in the combat-portion of the game, it's easy enough to out-level the enemies by performing other tasks that simple button mashing to get the mats you need from lower level monsters won't pose much of an obstacle.\n\nOutside of combat, I've always enjoyed the commission system in both games, and I think it serves well here for giving yourself a sense of progression and direction. While being rewarding enough that, while being somewhat repetitive in what you'll be building for the various residents of Sandrock, serves more as the foundation for pursuing other enjoyable ventures like upgrading your workshop, buying mats that you need either directly at stores or commissioning deliveries while giving you enough of a reward in not only the money you need, but additional materials and easy relationship improvements outside of the, arguably, rather shallow and repetitive NPC conversational engagements quickly enough to give you variety in other things to do without feeling like too much of a grind.\n\nThe story is also rather cute, if not a bit on the simple side, which IMO, is fine for what it is - it gives you a further sense of purpose and a meaningful way to progress unlockable areas, residents, and mechanics. I feel several of the NPCs have notable quirks that make them memorable enough to want to engage with them and their missions, although at times, even with the characters that are not designed to be long-winded (like Cooper), I found myself wanting to read the dialog faster than I wanted to hear it from them because there's just something about the way they talk and the flow that just made me frequently want to skip it. Can't really put my finger on why exactly, but this was especially true when interacting with them daily during the regular chat interactions. With that said though, one really nice touch is how NPCs all have their own individual reactions to story events that are enjoyable to listen to, even if they can be a bit long-winded sometimes. It's a nice touch to detail that somewhat makes your accomplishments in the game feel more relevant to your place in the world.\n\nLastly, while I haven't played much of it since EA, the multiplayer seems way more polished (and was non-existent in the previous game) and has been pretty fun so far. If you've got friends to play with, while it's completely separate from the base instance of the game, the co-op workspace and co-op commissions and being able to engage in spelunking and combat with friends gives it a fresh feel from the base, single-player, portion of the game.\n\n[h3][u]TL:DR[/u][/h3]\n- Solid improvement from the previous game in almost every way.\n- Combat improvements especially feel much better from previous games.\n- Story is fine, albeit a bit on the simple side. More focus made on the mechanics.\n- Many NPCs are memorable in their own way if not a bit long-winded and the base chat mechanic is a bit bleh but the \"play\" mechanics make up for it a bit (albeit, get a bit repetitive with the limited options and expensive energy costs to engage in them). \n- Multiplayer is a separate instance from the base, single-player, game, but having all the same mechanics being applied while playing with friends has, so far, been a very enjoyable experience and is way more polished than when it was introduced in EA.", "timestamp_created": 1699678840, "timestamp_updated": 1699678840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149911852": {"recommendationid": "149911852", "author": {"steamid": "76561199090253863", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 19837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2385, "playtime_at_review": 18344, "last_played": 1700360736}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth the wait!!

I would describe this as \"Unity Jank in perpetual Early Access\" \n\nThe yawning blackness within doorways feels awkward. The music's abrupt shifts between scenes and loading screens add to the awkwardness. Cut scenes feature jarring transitions. The concept of the ruins is goofy, with all the intellectual stimulation of one of those archaeology sand-treasure toys for toddlers. Digging dirt towards an icon and walking through black doors, hitting buttons for more icons\u2014repeat ad nauseam. Fishing is oddly implemented. The repetitive, brown environment is a monotonous downer. Two resources to manage for crafting: water and fuel. Why? You don't have to do much to manage either of them so I just don't even understand why it exists other than bloat. The furniture is bulky, occupying too much space without purpose. The game lacks a clear identity, failing to embody a competent farming sim, resource management game, or social game. The kids in the game all give me the creeps.\n\nThe English localization is spotty with errors that should have been fixed long ago. In-game advertisements (with grammatical errors!!) direct to external websites, including Amazon pages. They also beg for reviews via in-game advertisements. The inaccurate wiki diminishes the quality of available online information.\n\nDespite these issues, I'll persist in playing because I enjoy this genre. If I hadn't known it wasn't in early access, I would have unquestioningly believed it still was. If you have \"Switch store bloatware\" standards for games, you will probably be fine with this release. I neither recommend nor advise against this game. \n\nIt should 100% be cheaper though.\n\nP.S. I FORGOT TO ADD THIS STUPIDITY: When you walk into the edge of the water, the entire screen goes black and then you reappear at the edge of the water. If you walk in a second time in the same place, your character gets teleported to the center of town. I'm guessing this is because they intended to implement swimming at some point but just couldn't figure it out and so you get teleported as a failsafe to prevent your character from getting stuck.

Perhaps the only complaint the player could ever have is water management, and even then, for a player that is willing to learn and understand water conservation, a player will learn how to easily manage their water reserves with time and never run out of water (which will take a long time for people who have extreme difficulty with extremely basic management skills and extremely basic learning skills).\nIn any case, I have been playing this game since Closed Beta, I was a Kickstarter backer, and I think the full release is infinitely superior to the Beta, and it is way better than My Time at Portia, though it is reasonable to understand that the water management system is treated as the reason many people say this game is worse than My Time at Portia... it is probably the only downside to this game.\nEverything else is an improvement.

It's better than My Time at Portia, but only barely. The writing is genuinely good and voice acting is great. The characters themselves look great as well. Inventory is improved but I am not sure that warrants immense praise in a sequel, I would expect more mechanical improvements. The characters are definitely more demanding and engaged. Some times I wish they would honestly shove off though, a lot of them are deeply self centered and narcissistic. It's an attempt to show a more realistic community I guess, but SO many of them track anti-social and deeply narcissistic that I am not sure who I actually like in the town. Kudos I guess on making it feel like I really am in a backwater trash town.\n\nBut I waited a long time for it to leave early access, and now I am playing a game that still feels like it is in early access. \n\nAdditionally, level design feels very strange. The over world feels janky and the dungeons half baked in design. A lot of areas blocked by invisible walls and lazy graphics.\n\nThe town itself is not particularly impressive and walking away from locations feels like I am walking on an unfinished map. Many locations are deeply confusing to find and there are many absolutely pointless time wasting caves that have absolutely nothing in them except maybe a chest that drops a pointless piece of loot.\n\nEnemy's feel buggy and some of them are massively annoying to fight with a melee weapon. Hyena's jump and move constantly, rat men spawn in the air and can't be attacked. Combat is definitely more engineered from Portia but it doesn't necessarily feel better chasing around a enemy that essentially non-stop roll dodges.\n\nThe denizens look better, but you look like a carnival clown. Why are we still throwing utility pouches on things like they are 90s super heroes? Why can't anyone make a decent pare of pants, I'm tired of running around in ill fitting shorts. I feel like you should be able to reskin the armor in the game to others you have unlocked. Maybe that is a thing but it isn't apparent.\n\n----\n\nResponse to developer:\nThere are several instances where the corners of the Paradise Lost (I believe, first combat dungeon) has areas that look traversable that aren't. The fence going into Paradise Lost looks scalable. Walking into the Gecko Station there is a large dead space around the entrance that can't be walked through, you have to approach the station entrance straight on dead center to enter. Aside from that there are several areas that just seems empty though accessible including caves with little reward for exploring them. Feels more like I am punished for exploring in a game at least partial about time management, I now default look up a guide the second I am confused. Often the guide itself is confused like in the case with of the quest \"Whispers of the Heart\" where the streamer enters the cave thinking it might be where the quest location is. Understandable since Heidi appears to lead you there but then disappears (got stuck on terrain in my game) teleportating to the location but with no quest marker except a zone on the map. A quest with no timer listed but which logically does need to be completed that day and fails if not completed.\n\nSpeaking of quests that need to be completed on time, there are a ton that auto trigger by walking into zones and they can overlap with other quests you have happening. Perhaps you designed this to encourage players to not do quests saving them for future playthrough, but I don't think the majority of your users do play the game more than once. Games this scale are huge timesinks and I would like to not decline side plot character arc stuff simply because I have 3 of them going simultaneously.The pacing of quests simply doesn't feel in line with the default speed of the game. I understand I can adjust this but I would like the game at least defaulting to an optimal experience. This likely goes into my feelings towards the townfolk being off putting, berating me with quests that really seem like they should be commissions (Owen being the biggest offender though also not being told to stop like the others).\n\nAfter experiencing the combat more I think the problem is the lack of mobility in the main character during a fight. You feel Dark Souls speed while everyone else (non-duel) feels like they are playing an arcade beat-em up.\n\nI realize now there is a wardrobe tab, not sure how I missed it. Apologies for that criticism. Now I can wear my button up (with strange disco medalion/compass) and pants like a normie.\n\nI think some of my irritation is the above mentioned side quest pacing. A lot of characters don't really grow much and feel very one sided in their relationship with you, Qi in particular is deeply narcissistic and so central to the plot. There are definitely great characters but the ones who have big character flaws very rarely if ever showcase anything redeeming. Would be satisfying to be able to get back at Yan even a little and I have been playing the game for an in game year. Arvio really needs to not be a screw up once in a while. Amirah has 0 warmth even after being stuck making 50 fireworks for an event no one shows up to she responds to with a trailing ellipsis. I mean what is the player expectation here? If it's just the clique getting together to watch fireworks than why not have that happen? If it's a setup for a date why does Amirah respond to even the most mild show of affection with a trailing ellipsis? How long do you want me to humor this Fleeting Youth Club when they don't show up to their own events and, if it's a romance line, don't seem interested in you? I feel like I am doing a huge number of quests just to up relationship points, not because I enjoy them.\n\nWhen's Justice going to not be a failure riding off others? I'd love him to show some reason why anyone would want him as sheriff. Miguel is a psycho. Fang drugs me for his own amusement.\n\nFinal complaint, Clay and Bloodstone are deeply relied on for commissions. They are very difficult to source without going back to the first dungeon or buying some from a store behind a loading screen. I have so much stone and sand at this point I could forge another Sandrock in an effort to source clay and bloodstone and this is with me having built up a ton of bloodstone building a ridiculous field of moisture farms and needing the marble (P.S. please let us automate collection from these or something...).\n\n---- Post Post update\n\nSignup period for Showdown at High Noon is the day before the alert... Thanks. I mean how could you not see that being a stupid move?\n\nTons of bugs so far, some of which require restarting days.

Still, the story line, visuals, interaction, and game play are all interesting and very enjoyable.  It quickly became the game I want to play more than others.  \nIt isn't without bugs, but the developer is responsive and releasing patches frequently.  None of the glitches I've experienced have impacted my ability to play the game.  At one point the event audio got out-of-sync and I was hearing dialog from both previous and future events.  It was annoying, but not a game-stopper and closing/reopening the game resolved it.  Another issue where display of elevators was lagging saw a fix released the very next day (kudos!) \nFor me, the user interface seems inconsistent and somewhat clunky.  Here are a few examples:  I'm not a fan of holding 'tab' to switch to garden mode, scrolling to select an action, then pressing 'E' to select the seed, etc.  At worst, it can be frustrating determining the mouse/keystrokes needed to perform an action.  At best, it is never something I can do via muscle-memory without thinking.  Device production statistics is also not well laid out. Even after playing a considerable time I still have to study each machine's statistics to find the bit of information I'm looking for.   One positive, there is an icon in each device that allows focusing it to requirements of pending tasks--love that.  There is also a need for improvement to the main map to add more detail and descriptions.

Tons of quality of life features have gone in that make it a blast to play, especially with Inventory Management which is one of the biggest factors of this type of game (such as naming your chests, and an ability to \"Just stack similar items from my inventory into ANY of my chests\") \n\nIn comparison to something such as Stardew Valley (love!) I would say it's similar but different. Sandrock isn't a farming SIM for one - it's mostly focused on you being a builder. So it's a lot more on getting a workshop, crafting, setting up automation, etc. \nOf course there is still animal rearing and farming that can be had! But it's not the primary focus. \n\nThe world is still a great time, the characters in the city are fantastic (and voice acted often!) and a blast to go out on dates, have lunch with, or just say howdy in the town for. \n\nThe combat is rather enjoyable as well! Makes monster battling more enjoyable than many other games of this style. \n\nBig tip I'd have: If you find the days going by too quick (or too slow), you can change the Gameplay Speed! I found at first a little overwhelmed as I was trying to do commissions each day & by the time I finished, I was running out of daylight!

It takes the addicting loop of gathering resources to build machines to finish projects to build better machines to work with other resources and wraps it in a cozy blanket of interesting NPCs and a deep setting. \n\nThis is not a farming game. Even though it will inevitably be compared to Stardew and the wave of other similar games that have been released over the years, this is not a farming game. To me personally, Sandrock is much closer to modded Minecraft, Factorio, or Satisfactory. What you do get, inspired by Stardew (Harvest Moon, shout out to the OG) and its legacy, are NPCs to talk to and romance, quests to fulfil for said NPCs, and regular festivals.\n\nI personally enjoy the very clear loop of resource gathering and refinement to fulfil quests immensely. Like Portia (as rough around the edges as it was), Sandrock is very good at finding the balance between regular resource gathering to make any progress, without becoming too grindy (but! I'd guess I am in the latter first third of the game, so who knows if this stays true). Resources can be acquired in many ways, and there's always one that is easiest or most enjoyable to do. \n\nNPCs feel much deeper than in your average cozy farming game, with several of them having their own agency beyond reacting to your input. You might want to romance one of the bachelorettes, but she might not be sure that it's something that fits into her or your life - and so you have to do quests and navigate dialogue to figure the problem out together.\nMany of the NPCs also step out of the typical archetypes as you get to know them, or offer archetypes from the get-go that aren't often used in these types of games. \n\nI thoroughly enjoy the writing, which I did not expect to this amount. I certainly liked Portia, but I feel like the localisation of Sandrock is a big improvement (except for not giving us Qi's or Fang's full names!). There are plenty of references to popular culture that actually made me chuckle. \n\nSeveral - but not all - voice actors are also doing a fantastic job. I had Pen written off as uninteresting from the start, but his voice actor is doing an incredible job with his character, and I have come to enjoy him much more than I thought. However, some voice actors keep throwing me off with their line deliveries, or their accents. Nothing I could not see beyond or that would fully break immersion, but still noticeable if contrasted with the excellent other cast members.\n\nAt time of writing this review, I have played through 1.5 seasons in about 30 hours of gameplay.

It was an ambitious game with many of the things it tried felt mostly half baked and not fully flushed out.\n\nI can happily say that \"My Time at Sandrock\" not only meets the levels set up by it's predecessor, but also far exceeds them. \n\nFirst, the game proudly sticks with it's theme. Every aspect of this is themed around you being in a desert, from basic crafting to even fishing. On a side note, this is easily the better fishing mini games I've played, but I wont spoil how that works.\n\nSecond, the story is very engaging. ~50ish hours in, I'm very immersed in the setting and very motivated to keep going. The characters all seem to have their own motivations and there's a plethora of areas where their quests have pay off, both big and small. The small, being a mark of true craftsmanship.\n\nThird, the relationship mechanics are fantastic. They don't expand the barebones from the previous game (if it ain't broke don't fix it) but there's more to do around Sandrock than Portia. I do have a favorite addition though [spoiler] You literally hold hands with your partner when you're out on a date, they'll keep up with you as you run. This is the cutest damn thing in the world. Bless whomever pushed that to get in because it was worth it.[/spoiler] \n\nIf you've played the sequel, than this should be a no brainer. If you've not played the series, If not, I'd probably recommend going with the previous game first, but don't let that stop you if you're eager to start.

I was thrilled to find out that this game was going to have multiplayer in it, seeing as My Time at Portia does not have multiplayer, which heavily influenced my choice to buy it or not.\n\n      This game can be buggy at times and while I only have a 980 gpu, I can run this game at medium settings and it still looks pretty decent. I did not play the early access, only full release, and I can say that there seems to be quite a bit of content to this game. This game is very multifaceted with social/town, farming, combat, mining, building, animal, and pet aspects, with that just being what I have discovered with 19 hours of playing. I play with 2 other people and the game runs fairly well. I have only encountered a few lag/server sync issues between other players, a few UI glitch errors, and 1 wonky combat fight with an elite. But beyond those few things I haven't seen much to stop me from wanting to play this game as much as possible. \n\n\n[h3] Pros [/h3]\n- Lots of Content (19 hours in and it feels like I have so much more to do)\n- Decent price (I was gifted the game but seeing the price for how fun this game is seems fair)\n- Fun with friends\n- Multiplayer actual works\n- Leveling up feels important and good\n- Missions feel good and not like leg work (You can visually see the work you put into the town)\n- Tons of townspeople\n- Combat feels good and fun\n- Character Customization (You can super customize your character with sliders)\n- Gear (Weapons and clothes have stats that can help you with gathering and fighting)\n- Weather (The weather events in this game are really great. So far I have seen rain, sandstorm, and summer \n   heat. I am waiting to see snow in this game as of yet.)\n- Server Stays Up (No matter who owns the town, I am able to play on my friends server even after the \n   person who made it has left. This is a big game changer for me seeing as you don't have to stop playing on \n   one server because the host has left or crashed.)\n\n[h3] Cons [/h3]\n\n- Desync/stutter issues (I have only had this happen 2-3 times playing so far and it is fixed by a simple return \n  to lobby and rejoin.)\n- UI machine icons disappear (I have only seen this once and it was fixed by rejoining the lobby)\n- Forced Personal Chests (I mention this because it was a pain to have only so much room in the ONE \n   community chest you get at the start of the game. You can upgrade it, but I would like to have the option \n   to share my personal chest contents if I choose to. And not have to run back to home every time someone \n   needed something.\n- Combat (could use a little work on hit registration and how your character can go through the enemies \n   while swinging your weapon)\n- Accidental Playable Character Requests (In the game there is an option to talk to real people and play a \n   mini-game called Critters. It feels a bit annoying at times when you are trying to interact with machines or \n   doors and other playable characters get the input over the item/machine/door. Could be quite annoying if \n   playing with a lot of people in one area but not too bad overall.)\n\nOverall this game feels pretty fun to play and in just 2 days my friends and I have put in almost 20 hours each.", "timestamp_created": 1699502981, "timestamp_updated": 1699502981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500600457191467285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149792930": {"recommendationid": "149792930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020401403", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 3924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2769, "playtime_at_review": 1515, "last_played": 1700451804}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a tremendously satisfying game about harvesting materials, crafting, completing tasks, and helping a town prosper.

The game respects your time with convenient tooltips, tutorials, and things like paying to expand your bags directly from your inventory, or being able to complete objectives with materials in your storage.\n\nThe social aspect of the game is also surprisingly strong.  The characters are often interesting and the writing is genuinely funny.  There's an interplay of story and gameplay as certain events will cause prices of goods to fluctuate or prompt a community response.  There are mini-activities to do with townsfolk to increase affinity and neat holidays.  There's also lore bits here and there that I did not expect to be as poignant as they are. \n\nThere is combat, and it is fine, but I do not think that is the main draw.  My only complaints would be nitpicks.

A simple visual meter on the side of the tank would make life so much better.\n- A lot of the pop-ups such as hints/tips from quests and wandering around show up during cutscenes and can easily be missed as they don't stay there long so you might miss something important and thats very frustating\n\n\n= VERDICT =\n==========\n= My Time at Sandrock takes everything about the first game and makes it even better plus a little more! There is literally so much detail and realism packed into this wonderful stylized game to keep you busy with the game for hours on end and when you think it stops no it doesn't you can take things on again pretty much through continued multiplayer! Its a wonderful game with so many great gameplay machanics and you'll never want to put it down! I highly recommend it! I really hope to see this game come to android as well like the first one did!

Although My Time at Portia was a rough-edged gem that I still enjoyed quite a lot, Sandrock greatly improves on its predecessor in almost every way. The town and characters are brimming with personality, the story is great, the quests feel meaningful, and overall the game just feels good to play. The quality-of-life improvements over the original are significant, especially regarding storage. Combat still isn't perfect, though it's significantly better this time around. There is just SO much to do in this game, and the loop is very addictive and fun!\n\nIf you never played Portia, it's a bit hard to describe this game. It's not a \"farming game\", although you can do a bit of that. Rather, you are a builder. You salvage, mine, gather, and refine materials, and use those to make and build whatever the town's inhabitants request. There is a heavy focus on characters, relationships, and story, in addition to the surprisingly interesting crafting system. The requests and commissions range from small items, to pieces of furniture, to useful structures that actually get placed permanently in the environment. You, your home (inside and out), and your yard are all highly customizable. Almost everything you wear actually shows on your character, too, which is pretty neat!\n\nThe desert setting is more than just a backdrop, too. Farming is a challenge. Sandstorms are a threat. In order to keep your crafting machines running smoothly, you must keep them fueled, clean of sand, and cooled with water. Collection and conservation of water is important in this game, not only as a theme, but also in practice. It should be tedious, but somehow it's not, I think due to just how well they implemented this \"you are living in a desert\" theme overall.\n\nThe only two negatives I can think of are a bit of lag as things load in when transitioning areas, and the often charmingly-awkward voice acting. Neither of these are enough to even dampen my experience, though.

I've had Sandrock on my radar for a while. When I saw that they were intending to put Multiplayer in, I thought to myself I can afford to wait until it's actually here. When it dropped, I had time and so did my usual co-op buddies and we jumped into it. One of my friends had played Portia and the other had not. \n\nSandrock has had me gripped for a few days now, and I have only barely touched Single Player, spending almost all of my time in multiplayer. To those who have played Portia, the Multiplayer focuses on the gameplay and it delivers. It is very improved over what we had in Portia. To those who are not familiar, who are just looking for a game to play with the people they play games with: Do you enjoy games like Stardew Valley or Minecraft, where everyone can kinda pick a 'job' and meet up at the house or base at the start and end of the day and spend the middle doing who knows what? If yes, you'll like Sandrock. There are things like co-op bounties, co-op forms of the ruins where you hunt treasure, co-op dungeons, what seemed like a raid? (had its own tokens, was timed/scored) Sure, after enough time, you're going to  max out your skill tree and start dipping into others, but the join/drop nature of the game (up to four people) means that there's ... often ... a lot to do. If you hit the ground with both feet running, there's TONS of jobs to do. You can build yourself into a coma. You can go and make friends with townsfolk. You can try to get rich. \n\nThe urban planning mechanic is well thought out and it works well. I'd maybe twist the ranching store to come online a little earlier (by the time I unlocked ranching it felt like I was so late in the tree that it only existed as a means to get yak hair) but it's fun. It's fun to build your workshop and build your house and build your skills and build your relationships. It's fun. There is no overarching story in Multiplayer but you do iterate on the town through how you progress your commissions and by doing the urban planner. It's a good game for hangin' out with the guys. Really.\n\nAs for the progression? It can be kinda hard, at times. Not the combat, but figuring out where to get very specific tidbits you'll need. And the building commissions start to ramp up when you roam around the map. Sometimes, you don't have the ability to get or refine the things you need for the commissions. I've constantly opened the wiki to guide me in the game, which is something I do for a lot of games, but I know some people are dead set against it.\n\nAlso, relationships with NPCs move slow. Sometimes, I can't find the people I am looking for. There's a lot to learn how to do in this game because there's a lot to learn how to do. I still only know like four food recipes. There are sometimes minor bugs but I am guessing they'll get ironed out soon enough. Nothing so serious as a crash or any lost progress. It's not a perfect game, but it's better than Portia, which I already thought was good.

This game is LONG, but I really am enjoying it. The dialog with some of the characters is so charming and funny to me. Early game stamina is an issue like most games but with one problem, the food does little to nothing to help. Other than that, I think this game is awesome. There is a lot of depth here in terms of intermingling with the characters, which adds an extra layer to your experience with them. I love the details, for example; my character changed her hair and the NPCs noticed and commented on it. Small stuff like this really adds to the simulation aspect of this game. I never seem to get bored or have nothing to do and when I do get those rare moments off, i actually enjoy just roaming around and talking to people or exploring. Its definitely a worth while game if you like cozy simulation, RPG games. But word of warning to those that love farming... the farming plays a very minor role in the game in terms of progress, even though it is available. Combat is more extensive than usual cozy games and animations for it are vivid. Relationships (though I havent explored that much) are pretty involved, and building design is a bit tricky at first but offers lots of customisation. The game is just fun. It offers lots of small references to its predecessor, My Time at Portia (I didnt play it) which is cute for those players that did play that game.

As a long time Portia fan, I made the decision to wait for the full launch of Sandrock so I could  really delve into the experience. It was well worth the wait!! \n\nMechanics that I loved in Portia were only improved by Sandrock, I applause the mining and archaeology process! I am glad it's so much easier to manage artifacts and the geodes of ore. I also enjoy the addition of the scrap yard contracts for those older ore types you don't always want to get digging for.\n\nThe combat addition of the gun is really funny and clever with the western vibe. Although simple, the harder bosses do give a dark soul vibe with the roll dodging.\n\nCrafting has only gotten better, and I am glad certain quests don't ask for an egregious number of supplies like Portia did some times. Very reasonable and smooth to escalate types.\n\nCharacters! Wowie! This has gone leaps and bounds from Portia (although I will always love them!) Each character is so unique! Love the full dialogue for romance options, the personalities of ALL NPCs are a hoot! The writing has me laughing so often, you can feel the love with each cutscene no matter the minor character. I find myself actually wanting to befriend each NPC in the city, they all have such great personality!\n\nThe story has been just as fun as Portia, I LOVE the world building of this series. My only complaint is wanting more!! Need a prequel surrounding Peach or SOMETHING. The enemies, the subtle build of tension with hints through the newspapers and letters are a great touch. I find myself excited to open the mail!\n\nMy only cons so far are:\nBugs - very minor though. This game is so much cleaner than Portia at launch, a bit of hair bugs or clothing doesn't hurt nobody.\nNPC pathing - AI is always hard to manage, but lord trying to find some of these people before friend status is a nightmare! \nUnfortunate timings - I have had a few funny situations regarding cutscenes, sandstorms and time management. Maybe I'm just very efficient, but sometimes the mix and match of time sensitive missions can be a nightmare. Shout out to the calendar feature!\n\nAll in all, this game is an AMAZING addition to my much beloved Portia. The team knocked it out of the park and it's great to see what a budget can do. I am genuinely excited for any and all extra content they may throw our way, and I hope they celebrate such an awesome launch!", "timestamp_created": 1699345193, "timestamp_updated": 1699345193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149693736": {"recommendationid": "149693736", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965390618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 721, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1699700413}, "language": "english", "review": "cute, fun, super chill, phenomenal game. highly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1699344849, "timestamp_updated": 1699344849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149692337": {"recommendationid": "149692337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066398715", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7562, "playtime_at_review": 1844, "last_played": 1700500655}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game to spend long hours playing, there is always something to do, really hard to get bored with so much to do.", "timestamp_created": 1699341532, "timestamp_updated": 1699341532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149691333": {"recommendationid": "149691333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057215031", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 403, "playtime_at_review": 1430, "last_played": 1699390725}, "language": "english", "review": "i am obsessed", "timestamp_created": 1699339233, "timestamp_updated": 1699339233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149688562": {"recommendationid": "149688562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041151766", "num_games_owned": 511, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2044, "playtime_at_review": 1679, "last_played": 1699971229}, "language": "english", "review": "Honeslty really enjoying the game so far!

Coming in at the 200 hour mark (and possibly a few more) is no mean feat.\n\nMy Time at Sandrock took the formula Pathea started in Portia and dialed it up to the next level. The game plays roughly the same. You're a brand new Builder that arrived at a town that is in decline and it is up to you to turn your talents to improve the lives of those around you.\n\nThe gameplay loop is fairly simple. Go out into the wilds, gather resources, bring them back to your workshop and get your machines turning out the components necessary to fulfill your commissions, upgrade your capabilities and home, repeat. To do this, you manage stamina as you gather materials and also engage in light, fairly simple combat.\n\nWhat Pathea does well is package this up in a charming setting with an amazing cast of characters. The graphics engine, while simple, is supported by a unique art style that allows for a wide range of colorful residents of Sandrock while keeping the system demand to a minimum. My 7800x3d and 7900XTX are utter overkill for this game. That said, don't let the relatively mild requirements fool you - the game is beautiful. The art style is timeless, the town has a unique feel and the landscape vistas are wonderful. I found myself taking in-game photos of things to take advantage of the customizable portrait decorations you can hang in your house and, later, factory.\n\nThe engine does have a few hitches. The draw distance is rather poor and there aren't intermediate level of detail models. Objects will sort of pop into existence and if you have the LOD Bias set to anything less than maximum, you'll see the outline of a bubble immediately around you while the supports on your workshop's border fence pop into existence. It also struggles with longer game sessions, so if you play four hours at a time, you'll start to notice pathfinding breaking or weird artifacts like bushes floating up in space out in front of the Temple of the Light.\n\nAll in all though, I find the graphics and engine appealing. There are a few hitches and bugs here, though nothing experience breaking.\n\nWhat really makes Sandrock shine is the world Pathea created. Running in parallel with the events of Portia, Sandrock casts you as a builder that arrived in the town of the same name. The town is suffering from severe decline due to decades of resource mismanagement and environmental degradation. Water is in short supply and routine sandstorms buffet the town, slowly chewing away what little life is left in the area. Had it not been for a rich deposit of Old World ruins, the town would have long since died and been left to vanish in the dunes of the Euphala Desert.\n\nThe town is populated with a rich cast of colorful characters with their own distinct personalities. My personal favorites are Cooper, a local rancher who has a habit of speaking in lengthy diatribes and has a conspiracy theory streak (I swear Cooper's voice actor had more lines than the next five characters combined), and Unsuur, a well meaning but not too bright local Deputy who loves rocks a bit too much who I liken to a combination of Drax from Guardians of the Galaxy and Barnie Fife from The Andy Griffith Show.\n\nSurprisingly, the plot is actually quite deep. There is more going on than a simple tale of you building up stuff. There is banditry, a conspiracy and more going on that has a surprising climax. Sandrock not only has an interesting story, it goes well beyond what a charming life sim should be and fleshes out the broader world of the Free Cities Alliance and the surrounding nations.\n\nMy Time at Sandrock is a solid combination of life sim and narrative experience combined with a light factory inventory management game.

quest with the crane in order to be able to farm tin properly :D but I suspect that the error is more mine than the game :D but I'm open to any advice thankful :)\n\n\u2665 \u2665 \u2665\n\nEin richtig sch\u00f6nes Entspannendes Farming Spiel!! \n \nSingleplayer ist vielleicht nicht die Innovatievste Story aber sie ist liebevoll gestaltet und passt zum Setting.\nMultiplayer funktioniert und dort steht der Stadtaufbau erstmal im Vordergrund was auch sehr viel Spa\u00df macht.\n\nVon mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung an jeden der auf Cozy Farming Games steht wie Stardew Valley, Harvest Moon und ja auch Animal Crossing\n\nBisher nur einen Punkt an dem ich bis jetz noch Verweifel und zwar was ist der Ersatz f\u00fcr die Quest mit dem Kran um vern\u00fcnftig Tin farmen zu k\u00f6nnen :D aber da vermute ich den Fehler mehr bei mir als beim Spiel :D bin aber f\u00fcr jeden Tip dankbar :)", "timestamp_created": 1699274966, "timestamp_updated": 1699275052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

I've played a lot of life sim style games and this is one of the best by far - it's the only one I've played to rival my love of Rune Factory 4 in terms of gameplay, story and character dialogue.\n\nI have 110+ hours in the game (started a bit before the 1.0 release) and I'm not even finished the main story quests yet, I thought I was almost done a while back and it turned out I was only 2/3 of the way through. There are always meaningful story events happening and new characters being introduced to keep things interesting. \n\nThere are a lot of activities to do each day to stop things getting too monotonous - a mix of exploration, dungeon crawling, mining or hanging around town. You can also fish and farm, which I'm not too fond of doing in this game but are totally optional outside of a couple of quests. \n\nThe characters are where this game stands out - the localization team did a great job with the dialogue because it's full of personality and can be pretty hilarious at times. The town is very lively with the characters all having different relationships to each other and having a lot of joint quests and scenes so it feels like a real community. One downside is the day to day dialogue lines can get kind of repetitive but there are a lot of character related events which is where the bulk of the content is. Their faces are also not that expressive in dialogue which would be my main complaint, but the voice acting is very expressive and fills that gap. \n\nThere are some bugs at the moment but the devs seem very active and engaged with the community. Aside from the bugs the game feels very polished, and I'm honestly blown away at the sheer scale of it for a relatively small company. There is SO much content, from the very long main story, to the numerous character quests, to the new locations, mines and dungeons to unlock. And unlike Portia each mine/ruin feels unique and has distinct level design features to keep things interesting. Honestly huge props to the devs for what they've achieved here, you can tell a lot of love was put into the game and they genuinely had fun with the world and characters they created (speaking of the world, the worldbuilding is pretty in depth and the setting is very interesting - I did love the concept of My Time at Portia despite my criticisms of the game, and that interesting history continues to be explored here).", "timestamp_created": 1699253188, "timestamp_updated": 1699253188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149634132": {"recommendationid": "149634132", "author": {"steamid": "76561199001463897", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 25960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "playtime_at_review": 25362, "last_played": 1699586879}, "language": "english", "review": ":)", "timestamp_created": 1699251575, "timestamp_updated": 1699251575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149633355": {"recommendationid": "149633355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110239234", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3014, "playtime_at_review": 2677, "last_played": 1700152653}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me preface this by saying that I played My Time at Portia and didn't enjoy it at all. My Time at Sandrock absolutely blows it out of the water, and addresses my two most standout grievances about the first.\n\nThis time, they have designed the map properly so that your character never spends too long traversing from one location to another. The town map/level is beautifully made so that your workshop is never too far from any NPCs you might need to reach/chat with daily. Secondly, this is the most fun I've had with a towns' NPC population in a while. A lot of cozy game developers forget to develop their characters beyond the basic, typical strokes. At first I felt like this would be the case for Sandrock too, but I found myself genuinely enjoying a lot of the town's NPC personalities that shine through their questlines. The writing isn't nearly the best I've seen in a game, but it's definitely a step above most cozy games I've played recently. At least more fun, if anything!\n\nIf I had to pick at any obvious downsides, I'd say that some voice actors are clearly uncomfortable in their characters' accents and inflections and it shows. I don't mind it too much but it might be grating to some.\n\nAs of the time of writing, I'm 40 hours in and I'm still being engaged with the game, so it earns my seal of approval.", "timestamp_created": 1699249774, "timestamp_updated": 1699249774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149632704": {"recommendationid": "149632704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095176808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1038, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1700459867}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun, relaxing crafting sim, kind of like Harvest Moon and others in the genre, with the focus being on building things instead of growing them.", "timestamp_created": 1699248385, "timestamp_updated": 1699823135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419174641370773315", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1699259970, "developer_response": "We're sorry about this experience, could you try to update the GPU driver?\nIf it doesn't work, please try these temporary solution\uff1a\n1.

Don't get me wrong, Pathea makes grinding fun more than a chore, but when your whole game revolves around grinding, God, you've got to let people choose to use console commands. I completely would get if the devs locked the console only for multiplayer, but why a total hard lock. Once I complete the story and missions, Sandrock will feel like a massive chore if I have to continue grinding just to do the things I actually want to be doing. \n\nTLDR: Sandrock now feels like a sandbox game without the sandbox mode. Like playing in a sandbox without sand or attempting to swim in a pool without water. I can't recommend Sandrock once more unless dev console is returned.\n\n\nAside from that discrepancy, have some bullet points.\n\nPositive:\n\n1.) Very pretty game world, the town of Sandrock and her people feel rich and enticing. Although, diversity is what makes the world appealing, but that mostly ends if you stray any significant distance away from town or your workshop.\n\n2.)Romance feature in Sandrock gets more \"Worth It\" points compared to Portia. I romanced Unsuur, and his character arc was adorable and had me go from finding him irrelevant to him seeming like a wholesome, goofy character who I can strongly relate to. I cry when I see him in a sad or embarrassing sitch.\n\n3.) House building. Coming from a lifelong sims fanatic, Sandrock's home building feature draws me in despite it having a sort of learning curve. I'm very dependent on mouse/keyboard when in building games, so its of note that Sandrock's house builder catches my attention at all.\n\nNegative:\n\n1.) Despite its pastel-toned cartoonish vibe, Sandrock can feel too immersive. Grinding never gets genuinely less dreadful. Machines require both water and fuel to operate, adding an extra thing to worry about despite adding nothing of value to the game. Requiring fuel makes sense in a game like this, it serves as a subtle tactic to get the player to be actively involved in their workshop. Requiring water as well looks good in terms of world design, but serves no purpose otherwise that fuel requirement wasn't already achieving.\n\n2.) Sandrock feels like a rich, vibrant world. Sandrock also feels just as empty as it does to visit Earth in Starfield.  Aside from story purposes, I felt no eagerness to explore new map areas. I rarely leave the confines of my workshop or the town itself. When I bought Sandrock, the idea of it taking place in a desert allured me, it rendered in me that eager feeling to see what's out there. But after seeing what's \"out there\", I'm left feeling dissapointed that there wasn't more. No personality or variation in new map spaces.

Previously my favourite farming game was Portia, now it's Sandrock. It's such an amazing game that its existence makes me happy.\nLet me explain: I play a lot of farming games and I love the genre. Many of them share a number of common flaws however, such as shallow characters, weak non-farming mechanics, quest design that feels like chore. Not in Sandrock (or Portia, for that matter)! The characters interact with each other in believable and lively ways. It's no longer that the player is the only thing that exists to them. Everyone comes together to build a town and the player is only one small part of it. This makes the quests so much more believable.\nWhat really impressed me was the way it differs from/improves upon Portia. Portia did a lot of things very well, but Sandrock didn't just take those mechanics unchanged. Instead, Sandrock improved upon every little thing in Portia that bothered me (e.g. the guns were a bit weak in Portia; they're totally viable in Sandrock) and also refreshed other aspects (e.g. I liked the fishing mini game in Portia; Sandrock changed the mini game but it's equally entertaining) so that series fans like me aren't bored.\nThe way the multiplayer is implemented is also quite good.\nOverall, I just love the thought and care the devs have put in this game. It's incredibly rare nowadays to see a game in a popular genre where the devs didn't settle for easy formulas and past success, but continue to improve.

I enjoyed My Time at Portia and was excited to jump into this and be along for the development ride. If you enjoyed Portia and haven't picked this up yet, I'd highly suggest you do so, you won't be disappointed.\n\nI'm not much of a reviewer so he's my highlights.\n\nGood\n\n-The visuals-The visual presentation is great. The style they started with in Portia was kept for Sandrock and tightened, cleaned, and it really pops. A straight improvement from its predecessor.\n\n-Characters-The characters fit with the world that these games take place in. Goofballs on the one hand but can be serious on the other. It does a good job of portraying a tight knit group that has history with each other and rely on each other. The VAs do a good job and you never really feel like its being phoned in.\n\n-Story-So, you've played some Harvest Moon games, Stardew Valley, and similar games...whelp, you know what kind of story you're getting into. That's not a bad thing though, we love those stories and that's why we scoop games like these up because while every story in these style of games has a similar foundation what's built on top of it gives us an insight into the biggest character in these games, the town. The town is a character all its own, a combination of its past, present, environment, and the characters living in, around, or otherwise interacting with it throughout the story. It takes on a life of its own and Sandrock, as a town/character, is fun to see develop.\n\n-QoL-There were so many improvements to make life much easier in Sandrock, it would almost make Portia a little harder to go back to. But I very much appreciate everything they implemented in Sandrock to make a builders life easier when it comes to making your shop hum along and get those contracts done. Something a Portia player can appreciate more than a newbie but a thumbs up from me.\n\nBad\n\nLet me preface this by saying I'm not a tech savvy man, what you know about the power of rigs and all of the bells and whistles is probably beyond me so take this short section of bad with a grain of salt, your results may vary.\n\nWhen I'd start up the game, while my load times were rather quick when I'd get into the game it could take a solid minute, at max, for the world to load everything. If I got into the game and I was loading in while in the house, that was fine but once i left the house or would load into a game that had me outside there could be a bit of a wait for things to load. I never found it a terrible thing but a rig that's a little on the lower end might have more of an issue.\n\nThe other thing I noticed is that if I played for a block of 3-4 hours in a row I could start to experience slowdown that became much more significant as the time would go on and control inputs would also be laggy. A couple times character path-finding became erratic and would be my prompt to log off. I haven't done blocks like that in a while and so I don't know if it's a concern and it may have just been my machine but I did experience that.", "timestamp_created": 1699166047, "timestamp_updated": 1699166047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149567337": {"recommendationid": "149567337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255160295", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1450, "playtime_at_review": 1123, "last_played": 1699960590}, "language": "english", "review": "what a cute game", "timestamp_created": 1699164912, "timestamp_updated": 1699164912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465116292238235474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149566241": {"recommendationid": "149566241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053026013", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1912, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1700466515}, "language": "english", "review": "Man this game is addicting. the gameplay, the balance, the bodies, i just want Pen to rawdog me", "timestamp_created": 1699163155, "timestamp_updated": 1699163155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465686261653900146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149565615": {"recommendationid": "149565615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067973363", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 256, "playtime_at_review": 356, "last_played": 1700393765}, "language": "english", "review": "As of right now, the game has some major issues.

It improves on so many quality of life issues that I've experienced with other farming sims. Being able to alter how quickly the time of day passes by and also having villagers that actually have depth to their characterization, voice acting and updated dialog that matches the game's story progression, it's a breath of fresh air. I love that villagers actually react to weather conditions, change their form of dress to suit the weather, and don't just stand outside like robots as if it were a regular sunny day. Love the freedom and flexibility provided by designing your character's house and farmland. I also love the diversity in the cast of characters, they don't all look like they have the exact same cookie cutter anime body shape. \n\nAlso, being able to talk to npcs while still mounted on your horse, was a feature I was relived to see in this game. I cannot tell you how annoying it was playing games like harvest moon and having to get off your mount just to talk to someone, then jump back on your mount every single time. Being able to access all storage boxes from a single storage unit, being able to complete fetch quest assignments with items that you're not carrying with you at the time, but are still in your storge inventory is also a wonderful addition. The animals in the game, whether they be farm animals or wild animals that you fight for exp have their own unique charm to them. Love the fact that you can upgrade your horse and take photos with it. And the horse gallop and leaping animations are wonderful. \n\nI currently play this game on the steam deck and it's been a great experience. Camera felt a little wonky at first, had to set the X and Y camera sensitivity to 15 and the aim sensitivity to 40 for it to feel better on steam deck, so not sure if the defaults camera setting was set up for keyboard. Other than a few floating foliage plants in the air, and utensils not appearing in an npc's hand while eating, the game has ran near prefectly on my Steam Deck. \n\nCannot wait for any future dlc planned by this dev. Would love to see possibly mounted combat, or updated pets, enemy monsters, townsfolk, or farm animals. Or having a game in the future where you can choose to be an antagonist or protagonist would be a welcome to see. My only complaint would be during character customization, I wish the character could have more body shape options then just looking like a stick. When you're a woman, it's a little frustrating not being able to give your character a figure or hips. But other than that, I have no other complaints about the game. I truly hope other developers can see the success of this franchise and use it as an example to improve theirs as well.

If you want a chill builder sim game with a side of combat, this is a decent pick up.  That said there's a few things from the original that haven't improved:\n\n-The combat is still too simplistic.  There are still no special attacks (the enemies get them, but not the player) so all you do for the most part is mash LMB and roll dodge once in a while.  There are ranged weapons, but having to constantly build more ammo is annoying so you'll just melee everything for the most part.\n-The main story drags on way too long.  This was probably my main complaint about Portia as well.  As another reviewer put it, there's an interesting major plotline where you fully expect the story to end afterwards but it drags on with more mundane busywork for another 10-15 hours.\n-Waiting on things.  You can speed up time to 3x speed at least without mods, but it can still take 15+ minutes of real time to smelt a stack of bars so a lot of the time you'll just toss stuff in and end the day to skip time.\n-Relation grind.  Like the first game it is slow and tedious.  Some characters aren't too bad because they constantly put up commissions which give a big chunk for something you want to do anyways, or are heavily involved in story missions.  Others, like the doctor, require you go out of your way to talk to and constantly do boring crap like play Critters (basically rock paper scissors with cards) over and over.  As a bonus middle finger, [spoiler]several characters leave partway through main story and get replaced by new ones[/spoiler].  Hope you didn't waste your time on those ones!\n\nOverall though, it's a decent game for the price.  I never finished Portia, I tried twice and got bored halfway through both times.

The attention to detail in the environment and the variety of biomes made every journey exciting, whether I was traversing the  wastelands or navigating the mysterious ruins.\n\nThe crafting system is where Sandrock truly shines.

The feeling of progress as I upgraded my workshop and expanded my capabilities was incredibly rewarding.\n\nThe interactions with the colorful cast of characters in Sandrock added depth to the story and provided a sense of community in an otherwise harsh world. Building relationships with the townsfolk was an enjoyable aspect of the game, and their unique personalities and quests brought the game world to life.\n\nWhile my time at Sandrock was largely enjoyable, there were occasional technical hiccups and performance issues that could be frustrating. However, the frequent updates from the developers gave me hope that these issues would be resolved over time.\n\nIn conclusion, my 150 hours at Sandrock have been a delightful adventure.

This was the total hours I played on this game while it was still on Early Access and now that My Time at Sandrock is officially released this will easily double. I play a TON of farming/building/life sims but never quite as much as I have for this one (barring Animal Crossing which I feel is in a sub genre of it's own when it comes to sim games because of its real life time shenanigans).\n\nThe gameplay loop is addictive and will definitely give you that \"just one more day\" feeling in games like this one. If you ever played My Time at Portia (which I also have over 100 hours on) then let me just say that this one is better IN EVERY SINGLE ASPECT. The environment is much different than the storybook style that Portia has. You live in a harsh dessert and very much feels like starved for important resources like water (water is very important in this game) but I feel like seeing it transform with your help as the new \"Builder\" makes it feel all the more rewarding. \n\nThe NPCs feel very engaging and alive and react based on interactions you have with them (I had one NPC propose to start dating that I had to turn down and even though they seem to have taken the rejection well, you can still feel the heartbreak in the rejection with the ensuing dialogue you get from them when you try to talk to them again the following days). And yes! Reverse proposals are a thing!\n\nThe storyline is probably one of the best ones I have seen in all the games I played in this genre. It pushes you to keep getting the resources and fulfilling the requests as soon as you can to see what happens next.\n\nNow though there is a bit of farming, the main focus of the game is more on building the town and creating the things needed for said town building. From stage displays, mining lifts, \"bus stops\" to even having to plant flowers and crafting benches to beautify the town-these are responsibilities that fall on you as the builder.\n\nThere are so many other great things to be said about My Time at Sandrock but I will say as someone who has Stardew Valley near and dear to my heart (I have 100% that game on my Switch like twice already), that this is probably the only game so far that can rival the kind of enjoyment and satisfaction that Stardew gives.

If you've played the previous game in the series, My Time at Sandrock is superior in every single way except perhaps the price tag and in the rare category of \"Games with quality and originality from a Chinese developer\".\n\nUnlike the previous game in the series, the game has little focus on time limits and is generally a laid-back experience focused a little more on storytelling than on repetitive routine actions. You build devices, conduct repairs, decorate your home, ingratiate yourself to other townsfolk - It's tempting to compare it to StarDew Valley, however I find this somewhat inaccurate because StarDew Valley has little in the way of interesting writing, characterisation, nor a plotline to keep me engaged in it as it relies heavily on a modding community for such content.\n\nThis writing and characterisation successfully caters to both children and adults - characters aren't particularly complex in personality, however, the dialogue has an abundance of dry wit, sarcasm and humour to lampoon the moral lessons it's trying to impart; this cushions the irritation that adults may experience when being preached to about what they would consider as obvious lessons in responsibility such as \"Don't waste water\", \"Don't monopolise resources\", \"Don't behave like a psychopath\".\n\nNowhere is this more apparent than in quests where Saturday-morning-cartoon NPCs blithely remark on and lampshade their anti-social behaviour before you deal with them in a series of increasingly surreal methods. This makes the game worth playing for the comedic nonsensical and satirical value alone. \n\nThe cast of characters to interact with is amazingly diverse, and not in an annoyingly forced and hackneyed way, but in personality too. Many of them have humourous character flaws, such as the Sheriff's remarkably feckless and cavalier attitude toward due process; or his devoted understudy, who rather uniquely portrays autism in an endearing and positive light. I did not once feel that the game was overtly trying to advance a political nor social agenda on the player, which is often the case with other offerings in this genre.\n\nIt was a very wise decision to adopt this writing style as the story may have come off heavy-handed and sententious/preachy otherwise. This character building is absolutely unmatched by any other life simulator game I have ever played. The game even gives you the freedom to be as antisocial, spiteful and negative as you want, although this will obviously alienate yourself from the town community.\n\nIf you're looking to wind down from an exhausting day, I can think of few better games to play. If you're looking for a challenging and stressful skill-based game however, you may want to look elsewhere.

Fans of Portia will definitely have a good time telling a new story about their time in the \"My Time\" Universe, but it's still alot of fun if u haven't played My Time at Portia. I particularly appreciated the sneaky little overlap hints about there being \"another star builder\" in Portia ;). Sandrock offers a bunch of new fun features like being able to build your house Sims-style, and has a very satisfying amount of quests, side quests, and town events. The characters are dynamic, have decent storylines, and are voiced by some talented voice actors. It's easy to get attached. I loved being able to respond to letters in the mail, and feeling like i had a little more input over how i interacted with the city. And not for nothing, my ego enjoyed the good stroking that it got from a town that recognized me as it's heroine and awarded me thusly; something that i felt like i lacked when in Portia. I, of course, have my preferences and complaints, but that's only because i love this game/series SOOO much that too much is not nearly enough!

Graphics and NPCs are nice to look at. Unfortunately, that\u2019s all.  \n\ngameplay 3/10\ndifficulty 2/10\ngraphics 6/10\naudio 3/10\nstory 1/10\nsensitivity when it comes to serious topics (trauma, disabilities, death) 0/10\ndev support 0/10\nfalse promises 10/10\n\nThere sure were lots of problems with their previous game, My Time at Portia, devs simply weren\u2019t capable to handle resources and promised way too much. The result was and still is an unpolished game full of bugs and missing content for several dateable NPCs. Console ports are still a mess too, although Team17 and Pingle are out for several years now and it was all up to Pathea after this. Last update in 2021 caused more problems than it solved and even more than 2 years later, Pathea did nothing but announce some switch performance update. No actual update, no word about problems like missing items, stuck NPCs, unplayable missions or fixes for PlayStation or Xbox. They abandoned both, PC and console ports to work on Sandrock instead.\n\nThere were many promises to learn from previous mistakes with Portia and that everything would get better with Sandrock. Spoiler; [spoiler]it did not.[/spoiler] \n\nAs other negative reviews already pointed out; Sandrock kickstarter ended up being a scam.\nMany people backed because of 100k multiplayer stretch goal, which was easily reached. During early access the multiplayer actually did have story content for a while, just as devs promised. Later, they suddenly decided to backtrack and removed it. Their excuse; once more bit off more than they could chew and backers just have to accept this. No content, no chance for refund. \n\nThere were more false promises during and after kickstarter. Some examples;\n- announced timespan for backers to share exclusive content was shortened\n- all dateable NPCs getting same amount of content - no, it ended up being the same as in MTaP\n- fixing none working kickstarter DLC codes - not for me\n- promise to fix sensitive content - no\n\nEven if ignoring all of these mentioned above, I can still not recommend this game. Devs took their previous game MTaP, added desert location, more generic graphics, some new features and a different writing style. \n\nWhile simple gameplay and low difficulty are quite fitting for this genre, their storytelling is unbearable. Memes, movie quotes, references, breaking the 4th wall, primitive thirst traps and puns galore, devs admitting at discord to copy entire NPCs from Disney and others. A ref or joke once in a while is nice though it\u2019s far too much in this case. Sandrock feels more like a parody or browsing social media rather than diving into a game with reliable NPCs. Also, very often those jokes are out of place or go way too far. For example;[spoiler]\n- Fake kidnapping a traumatized man\u2019s pet to get his attention\n- Some NPC pretending to be disabled because being too lazy to work \n- NPC, who is worried their family member might die after already losing another one, is portrayed as fire spitting monster\n- Making corpulent NPC a joke by adding ridiculous amount of food to his room[/spoiler]\n\nDevs also came up with the weirdest excuses for missing quality. Like saying not to add optional (lol) voice acting for main character because they don\u2019t want to limit players\u2019 vision of their avatar too much. Well, they actually don\u2019t mind limiting our vision by bringing MC\u2019s parents and childhood friend to the game, which of course is a way bigger limitation. \n\nWriters are showing a huge lack in sensitivity and even made fun of some players at reddit and discord who brought up their sincere concerns. This behavior is mostly unprofessional.\n\nWriting also suffers from missing consistency; plot, timeline, even entire NPCs. Especially recurring NPCs from MTaP. [spoiler]Mint\u2019s whole backstory and childhood were changed to promote Qi, Ginger became implausible careless, not following doctors\u2019 advices anymore, Gale prioritizes rather meaningless daily work over his precious daughter and leaves her behind, while the formerly cold, detached and standoffish Gust now is loud, unjustifiably aggressive and violent to make players sympathize with director\u2019s favorite NPC Fang, who is permanently portrayed as everyone\u2019s victim.[/spoiler] Which leads to another problem; playing favorites. If you\u2019re not interested in sad novel trope Fang or stereotype himbo Logan, be aware your favorite NPC doesn\u2019t get much content since writers focus on those two heavily.\n\nI gave Pathea a chance and wanted to support their growth. There\u2019s nothing wrong with making mistakes if you\u2019re willing to learn from them and show process. Quite disappointing, this isn\u2019t the case with Pathea and Sandrock. Same mistakes all over again and even adding new ones. This is why I can\u2019t recommend this game.   \n", "timestamp_created": 1698932784, "timestamp_updated": 1698932784, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.406559795141220093", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1698936509, "developer_response": "Thank you for sharing your feedback with us.

There are tons of quests and side quests where characters ask if you can spot them money because the economy in Sandrock is awful, and public servants will frequently lament the difficulty the town has getting government grants and the belief the residents should 'just move somewhere nicer' without regard for the town's unique culture or the financial hurdles one must jump over to be able to afford moving.\n\nI'm still not done with the game's main story line even 80 hours in, but I'm excited to see how it further develops arguments between characters about the potential perils of technological advancement, because it seems like the game's religious faction is on the verge of lashing out at Sandrock's local government for making use of scientific advancements to try and make the desert environment more habitable.\n\nThe game's premise also allows it to offer critique on world politics and modern society from the perspective of characters who are discovering information about us hundreds of years in the future. In the 'My Time at' series' lore, to really simplify it, technology progressed with little oversight or regulation which made it trivially easy to start a world war that decimated most (all?) of the planet's surface and plunged the world into a new dark age, with people living underground until they were able to return to the surface and rebuild on top of the ruins.\n\nI was surprised by the way this game tackles criticisms of the genre as being centered on mindless extractivism; the rationing of water from the local supply is a serious gameplay factory to account for, the logistical challenges of importing water from other towns is discussed frequently, and you're told as soon as you start the game that logging is illegal due to how few trees there are. Plus there's a serious focus on scavenging for scraps and re-purposing those into materials.\n\nThis game really surprised me; I had kind of written it off because I thought the art style was a touch off-putting, but the narrative, character writing, and gameplay loops have all charmed and hooked me.\n\nNow, because that phone booth said the developers read reviews of the game for feedback, here's some very specific complaints I'd like addressed:\n\n1. I'm in the summer of year two, partway through the Bronco the Kid quests, and I keep getting building commissions for items I cannot complete because I haven't met Musa yet, which means I haven't gained access to the areas that unlock when he shows up in town. Some of the commissions I've seen posted but can't complete are Industrial Machine Tools, the Advanced Civil Processor, and Chromium Daggers. I have these recipes already because I've been diligent about doing machine research with Qi and buying recipes from the Commerce Guild, but I think the game should check to see whether the player has the ability to get the materials necessary to make something before it pops up as a commission.\n\n2. After you first get the chance to express romantic interest in Elsie, there's a line of dialogue where she declares 'I'm a legal adult' in frustration at the way her parents treat her. I appreciate the effort to make it clear she's not too young to ethically date, but she's very childish, and that line just makes her sound more childish. The mention of legality feels like a reassurance to the player, which doesn't make for good character dialog.\n\n3. At some point, jumping with my camel started causing the game to freeze in the air for a half-second, after which it hits the ground and all four hoof-hitting-ground sounds play one right after the other. I swear the jumping animation used to be way smoother without that hitch and without the weird sound; I don't have performance issues in this game, so it's not lag as far as I can tell.\n\n4. Sometimes machines will get stuck saying they need to have the sand cleaned out of them, and no matter how many different positions or angles I try I cannot see a sand pile to remove with my duster. I found that picking the machine up and putting it back down fixes it temporarily, but I would prefer to just not have that issue, it's annoying having to finesse the position of a civil furnace that sits between two other furnaces.\n\n5. I need storage to be sortable across all boxes instead of the 'sort' option just sorting that individual storage box, as well as the ability to search for an item in storage by name. I would also like for storage to always be accessible when you're gifting a character something. It's frustrating going through my 10? 12? large storage boxes, each with two pages of items to scroll through, especially since item names are only visible by using the left stick and going over every item.\n\n6. Finding relic parts for Qi's side quests is too time consuming. I would prefer the quest-necessary relic pieces be located in chests in the ruins rather than in the dirt; I haven't found the scanner particularly effective at locating the quest pieces, so I've just been hitting every piece of dirt I can find on every floor hoping to uncover a relic piece eventually, which is extremely tedious when I also really need to move on to a new floor for the ores so I have the materials to complete my commissions.\n\n7. The lack of tin scrap makes bronze more difficult to craft than stuff like chromium or manganese steel, and I'm not sure why that's the case given bronze is required for crafting so many different things.\n\n8. There should be an option to turn on alerts for commissions that are going to expire that day. Even if you're tracking your commissions that are due the soonest, you won't see when the commission expires on the main screen.\n\n9. The shop interface should tell you whether clothing/accessories are better or worse than your current gear; I can't really compare my gear when it's all named something like 'Stunt Rider Desert Warrior Visor' or 'Bright Defense Team Boots' since those names don't convey anything about their stats. It's also a struggle to remember my shirt provides, for example, '+136 health + 17 stamina +5% critical hit chance + Negates poison status effects' when I'm in a shop going through a bunch of different shirts all with different stat buffs and effects.\n\n10. Add a setting that lets run be set as the default movement speed, please. Using the 'toggle' doesn't work because there a bunch of annoying circumstances where the game toggles the player back to walking.\n\n11. It's pretty easy to get stuck on obstacles in the sandrunning competition, and I lost a race because I got stuck under a boost pad ramp after hitting it from the side and had to forfeit to get out.\n\nAll of that said though, it's a great game, I'm looking forward to getting through the main story so I can go try My Time at Portia after this!", "timestamp_created": 1698824633, "timestamp_updated": 1698824633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149282672": {"recommendationid": "149282672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059546897", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 192, "playtime_at_review": 988, "last_played": 1699718920}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played many many games that attempt to fill the itch that these kind of games offer.\n\nThe cycle for me is\n1. buy new interesting sim, builder, rpg, etc. game.\n2.

If you're into this genre of games, you will like this game. It's well put together, I personally haven't encountered any breaking bugs, it performs well, it looks nice and there's a lot to do.\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2]In detail[/h2]\n[h3]The good[/h3]\n[b]Graphical quality[/b]\nThe game is quite a step up from Portia, and comparing it to other offerings within the genre that adopt 3D visuals, I think only Harvestella has it beat, in terms of technical quality (shaders, lighting, texture work et cetera) and details such as tufts of grass bobbing in the wind, sand particles and dust clouds blowing over arid terrain, NPCs and mobs reacting to things happening around them.\n\n[b]Performance[/b]\nI'm playing this on Deck. When I first tried this on Deck when I bought it roughly a year ago, I was forced to put the settings to a low preset, and my Deck struggled to maintain 30FPS. In the current version, in the year of our lord 2023, I have every graphical setting maxed out and the game is running between 30 and 60 FPS on average. easily hitting 60FPS in interiors.\nAll in all, with how the game looks, I think the performance is pretty impressive.\n\n[b]Sheer volume of content[/b]\nI'm roughly 20 hours in to a new save on this version, and it feels as though I have yet to finish the first chapter in the story - I'm still witnessing new character introductions, NPCs treat me as the \"new builder\". At the same time, literally every day since starting the game (I'm roughly at the end of the first in-game month) I've started the day with a new unique situation unfolding that day, ranging between character plot and main story beats, sometimes unlocking new features, sometimes unlocking new areas, sometimes just offering up new insights in characters or the world.\nThere also appears to be quite a breath of content. I haven't dipped my to into every system yet - I honestly don't even know roughly how much of the systems on offer I've engaged with. However, on top of the workshop, it appears you also gain access to more traditional elements such as farming plots and animal keeping. Then there's a whole slew of activities available on certain days of the week, usually small in scope but quite numerous, such as making weekly deliveries of clay to the pottery artisan or helping with cleaning up the communal water supply. These may be simple activities, but they do help build a sense of community and add authenticity to the setting.\nThere's a lot more, but I can't be arsed getting in to it. Just know that the main meat of the game (running the workshop) has quite a bit of depth, and at the same time there's breadth of content in the periphery.\n\n[b]Writing[/b]\nPeople who played MTaP know this already - the writers at Pathea seem to have quite a bit of fun adding character to, well, the characters. This games' script has a lot of moving parts: When certain events trigger is directly influenced by your actions as a player, so the order in which events happen can't be guaranteed. Despite this, the tone of the script is quite consistent. Even if when you jump from a serious scene where the titular town is under assault to one where a writer is receiving eloquently phrased harsh critiques from a kid (\"I'm in your tawget demogwaphic\" cracked me up) and you can see his heart break a little. This is all backed up by surprisingly good voice acting. The voice cast is varied, mostly fits the characters being depicted and the direction is excellent. This is a step up from Portia.\nI think they spent more time proofreading the game script as well, as even the little stuff like item and skill descriptions have been immaculate so far.\n\n[b]Game flow[/b]\nThis is hard to pin down exactly, but the game flows really well once you get into the rhythm of it. Anyone who's played a game in this genre will know what I mean by that; You get into a routine, find out what works and what doesn't, and then you start scaling up and becoming a giant capitalist with a zillion weird lil machines churning out products, earning you a tidy profit. In Sandrock, somehow, even early game resources kept feeling worthwhile to amass, and I ended up doing my best to figure out what to spend the day in in order to keep the machines running with stuff which would allow me to most efficiently complete next days' comissions.\n\n\n[h3]The subjective[/h3]\n[b]Character art[/b]\nLove it or hate it, Portia character designs were distinct. In Sandrock, the style is a bit less pronounced. Personally, I like it better this way, as I found the Portia characters veered between distinct and grotesque.\n\n[b]Focus/direction[/b]\nThis game definitely requires you to explore and experiment a bit. A lot of information is available in-game, especially once you've discovered something e.g. a material will have details on how to procure it once obtained.\n\n[h3]The bad[/h3]\n[b]A sense of confusion and/or being overwhelmed[/b]\nThis game has the exact same issue as Portia: It's front-loaded, and it doesn't always succeed in explaining all of its' mechanics due to the sheer amount of stuff there is to see and do. Some things go completely unexplained and just sit there in the UI, staring at you accusatorily, daring you to interact with them and finding out what will happen. \nThere's a lot of systems which is all fine and dandy, but you're also not incentivized to take your time figuring them all out. This makes especially the first few days of the game play out in a hectic fashion. I had to re-learn a bunch since it's been a hot minute since playing MTaP, and starting this fresh would probably be worse. It's a shame, because I can imagine people being scared off by this. Heck, I put down Portia and almost never came back to it when I first played it, due to this exact issue.\n\n[b]Simultaneously polished and full of skung[/b]\nThis game contains Nintendo levels of detail and polish in some areas, and gets extremely skungy in others, and these disparate levels of polish overlap at times. To illustrate: I'm watching a nicely choreographed cutscene complete with great lighting and what appears to be a blend of mo-cap and manually done character animations, lending it legitimacy while keeping consistent with the general art direction of the game. The cutscene ends. My character automatically starts pathing towards an arbitrary position, gets snagged on a fence, runs in place for a moment, phases out of existence, reappears a few meters away, and two NPCs pop in next to them. All the while little shrubs are waving in the wind as a tumbleweed rolls by in the beautifully rendered sand drifts.\nTo be honest, this could be seen as a positive as well, considering the fact that all of Portia nested comfortably in the janky Skungzone, so it's a triump Pathea have managed to elevate their work to this level. However, the disparity means that the skungness stands out more admidst the Nintendonean polish levels, whereas in Portia the entire vibe was skung so it just fit.", "timestamp_created": 1698333471, "timestamp_updated": 1698334629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148893711": {"recommendationid": "148893711", "author": {"steamid": "76561199192536480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5562, "last_played": 1698301670}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are looking for a game similar to Startew Valley then I do not recommend\nMy Time at Sandrock.

I highly recommend doing these daily and picking the most profitable ones as money is more important than the other two rewards.\n\nSaving midday is not a common thing to happen in Farm/Life sim games and that is why I really like this game, (Portia doesn't have this feature). Also that comes with midday saves is when you complete a quest or commission you auto save and have a quick save which is really handy to have.\n\nSurprisingly enough as well as the previous game, there are English voice actors despite being an indie game from China, every secondary character is voiced by someone. While it isn't fully voice acted (unvoiced lines or grunts that don't match dialogue) it does offer a solid amount of voice acting when it comes to story events to make you really feel immersed.\n\nThere are a large variety of weapons, you can have 4 types of melee weapons, multiple ranged weapons and even some unique weapons that can't be crafted. Each melee weapon has its own style and combo, whether it be daggers for fast but weak attacks or a greatsword which is slow but does a lot of damage.\n\nDecent:\n\nRelationships in this game follows every other farm/life sim game, there isn't a weekly limit but if you give an item too much they will like it less. The game is good at indicating if there is a relationship event going on as it will be marked on your map but the game doesn't really tell you if you even have events available for a character or if it is just end of current build.\n\nThere is a skill tree that you can do, but maxing out those 4 skills basically just fill up the entire tree leaving no real choice in the end. Skill points are only gained by doing those specific skills. Though I do think this idea is pretty neat, I will always prefer character levels rewarding skill points (Portia did this).\n\nFarming had a step-up from Portia, where you are able to place farming plots anywhere on your land instead of planter boxes. You can easily and efficiently plant items the higher the toolbox up to a 4x4 planting/watering/fertilizing area which is quick and easy. Farming has some flaws as well, farming early game is terrible. since it is just inefficient. You have to apply a lot of fertilizer, water and straw just to make a profit, you can't automate farming either so you have to constantly be on watch to water.\n\nBad:\n\n!!THEY ADDED THE FEATURE TO GROUP ITEMS AND MOVE THEM IN BULK IN THE 1.0 UPDATE!!\n\nMoving housing items is a real chore, there is no area select so you have to move each individual item one by one (including farming plots). I would just recommend using your character instead at some points. Moving your house with 2+ stories is also annoying as whenever you move it, you have to move each individual story top to bottom and if you had items in the house after reapplying those stories, some might get removed since staircases don't remember their last known location but instead have a predetermined location every time you add a new floor.", "timestamp_created": 1698178951, "timestamp_updated": 1699530068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148801180": {"recommendationid": "148801180", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972265845", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11708, "last_played": 1698106543}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and wholesome game with huge amount of content.\nMy 195 hours are from just one playthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1698171134, "timestamp_updated": 1698171134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148784308": {"recommendationid": "148784308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062644419", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 197, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 284, "last_played": 1699197464}, "language": "english", "review": "chill game", "timestamp_created": 1698153404, "timestamp_updated": 1698153404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148777950": {"recommendationid": "148777950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198828789897", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 23348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "playtime_at_review": 23278, "last_played": 1699928765}, "language": "english", "review": "I find the game super relaxing after a long day.

According to the devs, the story is 3.29 times longer than My Time at Portia \u2013 already a pretty long game, mind you. I know \u201cmore game\u201d is supposed to be good, but Sandrock overstays its welcome and makes you wonder when it finally ends. Imagine watching a movie, and after an epic showdown with the main villain, when you\u2019re ready for the credits to roll - another movie begins instead. It means you need many hours of your life to complete the story in one sitting and not lose track of it. There are more than twice side quests than Portia, too - and most of them are on a timer. I ended up so overwhelmed by quests that I began refusing them at some point, which in turn led to a frustrating feeling of missing out on content. There is more of everything else as well. There are hundreds of items - scrap alone comes in like 15 varieties - making inventory management an ever-present annoying part of the gameplay. \n\nIf a developer from Pathea is reading this - I would like you to grab a sheet of paper, write \u201cLess is More\u201d on it, then hang it somewhere in the office where everyone can see it every day. I have no need for 20 romantic interests in the game, if the majority of them will lack character, quests, unique items, voice acting... Give me just 3 but make them really fleshed out and rich with content. Case in point: Nia - she got so much backstory, relevance to the plot, unique events and ties to the main character that she makes every other romance look like an unnecessary waste of development resources.\n\n[h3]Cardboard protagonist[/h3]\n\nSandrock is a heavily narrative-driven game. For 100-150 hours you will be listening to dialogue with multiple people, constantly referencing your character. For some reason, even though your character is not a \u201cblank slate\u201d and has a backstory, parents, childhood friend etc. you are free to name him/her whatever you want. This creates a huge problem for voice actors. You see, expecting them to voice dozens of custom names like Codsworth or Vasco would be unrealistic, so they only had two options - either skip the player character\u2019s name entirely, or to use generic \u201cthe Builder\u201d. As a result, dialogue constantly loses meaning and feels jarring. For example, \u201cMe, Harris and you will go to the cave\u201d turns into \u201cMe and you will go to the cave\u201d; \u201cS.S. Harris\u201d (ship name) turns into \u201cS.S.\u201d (???), and even though you can be a best friend to people and marry them, they will still refer to you as \u201cthe Builder\u201d (even if there are other builders present in the same scene). \n\nWhat exacerbates this issue is the silent protagonist. Which on its own perhaps wouldn\u2019t be that bad - if Mi-an didn\u2019t exist. Mi-an is also a Builder, and so in most scenes she effectively speaks for both of you and ends up praised for things you did. All leading to a feeling of the player character being a sidekick to Mi-an. While I realize voicing the whole 250.000 words main story is unrealistic, this just leads back to my point - why did they write a huge story like that?\n\n[h3]Howdy, pardner![/h3]\n\nSandrock feels awfully derivative - it just grabs about every single gameplay element and design decision from Portia and carefully copy/pastes them into a new game. The only meaningful difference here is the new desert setting, and frankly - it\u2019s terrible and doesn\u2019t work for a game like this. You will struggle to tell the seasons apart - it\u2019s always just sand, with the (very) subtle coat of white in Winter and green in Spring. Outside of an occasional sandstorm the weather is also static for the most part \u2013 you will not see any snow and I only witnessed rain 1 (one!) time after 100+ hours into the game. Of course, there are setting-based complications: like you need water (rare and expensive) to cool your machines; sand accumulates on them over time so you need to clean it; you are not allowed to chop trees near the city etc. However, ultimately all of it feels like busywork, aimed at making your early game more painful and tedious than it needs to be.\n\nNarratively, it\u2019s just a mix of every Wild West clich\u00e9. Your will hear \u201cHowdy!\u201d from about every character, even the newcomers. There are sheriffs, bandits, cowb... I mean, Yakboys. Which I could probably live with, but the huge appeal of a My Time game is to be able to improve your community and see a meaningful impact of your actions over time. I still remember building a fast travel system in Portia and how much of an achievement it felt. Here the main theme is greenification of the desert however, which essentially makes you feel like a sidekick to botanist characters and a glorified gardener, as the Builder stuff takes a backstage to planting trees. Furthermore, the first half of the exceedingly long story just has you doing barely meaningful stuff, with the common theme being \u201cbandits broke our bench/water tower/farm/statue - please repair it!\u201d. Yes, there are guns now - but they feel like a gimmick, requiring entering an \u201caiming\u201d mode, and are so ammo-hungry that using them is just not sustainable, unless you enjoy grinding mines to make more bullets. You do get the ability to join Civil Corps as a Deputy this time round, but ultimately this only serves to further distract you into becoming a \u201cjack of all trades\u201d.\n\n[h3]RPG and progression[/h3]\n\nSandrock tries to be more of an RPG, with everything from your chair to your horse coming in multiple tiers of quality. You can also \u201crefine\u201d an item to increase its level and quality by throwing rare gems you first have to grind at it. At first I thought this to be a very cool system, as I imagined it would be possible to upgrade any piece of clothing indefinitely and make it competitive in the late game - but you\u2019re only able to upgrade anything up to 10 levels above its \u201crequired level\u201d, making the system pointless. Furthermore, this system only made matters worse as for the first half of the game I had to actively avoid the \u201cblue\u201d quality commissions - because I simply did not have the required gems at the time to make such quality items.\n\nAlso, while there are levels and skill points \u2013 you will easily unlock everything provided you play long enough, so there are no builds or anything like that. The perks are subtle buffs rather than something that has great impact over the gameplay. As such, the main form of progression comes in the form of gear - and is fully tied to the main story, which unlocks more areas and resources. While you unlock Bronze and Iron relatively early on and at a steady pace, it is unfortunately followed by a very long and stale midgame where you don\u2019t unlock anything until late game, where you get Chromium and Aluminum almost back to back.\n\n[h3]Writing[/h3]\n\nSandrock is filled to the brim with memes and popular culture references, and every quest title is an attempt at a witty pun. It all looks quaint and fun at first, but quickly grows exhausting, especially as the writers make NPC go more and more out of character just to throw in another \u201cMic drop!\u201d. The writing feels too concerned with the \u201ccurrent day\u201d agenda for a game that\u2019s supposed to take place in a post apocalyptic setting. For example, a woman I offered my help said she does not accept \u201cfree help\u201d from strangers, and almost reported me for sexual harassment. And after that a homosexual man made advances on my male character without my consent, or ever speaking to that particular character to begin with. Some characters are so obnoxious I found it really hard to co-exist with them in the same game.\n\n[h3]TL;DR Upgrade? More like side-grade![/h3]\n\nMy time at Sandrock was almost 200 hours full of adventure and emotions. Just like Portia, this game has quite a few enjoyable things. Pretty graphics, some quality of life additions, even the optimization is finally half-decent!

I def recommend it. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1698047762, "timestamp_updated": 1698047762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514925360679626465", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148709286": {"recommendationid": "148709286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198841937172", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 68241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3675, "playtime_at_review": 60636, "last_played": 1700501543}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game", "timestamp_created": 1698027030, "timestamp_updated": 1698027030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148692394": {"recommendationid": "148692394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029940878", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 3233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 808, "playtime_at_review": 2230, "last_played": 1700495033}, "language": "english", "review": "Huge fan of my time at Portia.\n\nIt's like they took all the good stuff from that game and made it slightly better and improved on a lot of things.\n\nI've only run into a few visual related bugs but no game breaking ones.
