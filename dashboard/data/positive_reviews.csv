2023-11-08,"i played portia, a while ago. i've had sandrock on my radar for a while. when i saw that they were intending to put multiplayer in, i thought to myself i can afford to wait until it's actually here. when it dropped, i had time and so did my usual co-op buddies and we jumped into it. one of my friends had played portia and the other had not. 

sandrock has had me gripped for a few days now, and i have only barely touched single player, spending almost all of my time in multiplayer. to those who have played portia, the multiplayer focuses on the gameplay and it delivers. it is very improved over what we had in portia. to those who are not familiar, who are just looking for a game to play with the people they play games with: do you enjoy games like stardew valley or minecraft, where everyone can kinda pick a 'job' and meet up at the house or base at the start and end of the day and spend the middle doing who knows what? if yes, you'll like sandrock. there are things like co-op bounties, co-op forms of the ruins where you hunt treasure, co-op dungeons, what seemed like a raid? (had its own tokens, was timed/scored) sure, after enough time, you're going to  max out your skill tree and start dipping into others, but the join/drop nature of the game (up to four people) means that there's ... often ... a lot to do. if you hit the ground with both feet running, there's tons of jobs to do. you can build yourself into a coma. you can go and make friends with townsfolk. you can try to get rich. 

the urban planning mechanic is well thought out and it works well. i'd maybe twist the ranching store to come online a little earlier (by the time i unlocked ranching it felt like i was so late in the tree that it only existed as a means to get yak hair) but it's fun. it's fun to build your workshop and build your house and build your skills and build your relationships. it's fun. there is no overarching story in multiplayer but you do iterate on the town through how you progress your commissions and by doing the urban planner. it's a good game for hangin' out with the guys. really.

as for the progression? it can be kinda hard, at times. not the combat, but figuring out where to get very specific tidbits you'll need. and the building commissions start to ramp up when you roam around the map. sometimes, you don't have the ability to get or refine the things you need for the commissions. i've constantly opened the wiki to guide me in the game, which is something i do for a lot of games, but i know some people are dead set against it.

also, relationships with npcs move slow. sometimes, i can't find the people i am looking for. there's a lot to learn how to do in this game because there's a lot to learn how to do. i still only know like four food recipes. there are sometimes minor bugs but i am guessing they'll get ironed out soon enough. nothing so serious as a crash or any lost progress. it's not a perfect game, but it's better than portia, which i already thought was good. and if you're into the genre, it's absolutely worth picking up.",15199,Played Portia Sandrock Radar Intending Multiplayer Afford Wait Dropped Time Usual Op Buddies Jumped Friends Played Portia Sandrock Gripped Days Barely Touched Single Player Spending Time Multiplayer Played Portia Multiplayer Focuses Gameplay Delivers Improved Portia Familiar Game Play People Play Games Enjoy Games Stardew Valley Minecraft Kinda Pick Job Meet House Base Start Day Spend Middle Sandrock Op Bounties Op Forms Ruins Hunt Treasure Op Dungeons Raid Tokens Timed Scored Time Max Skill Tree Start Dipping Drop Nature Game People Lot Hit Ground Feet Running Tons Jobs Build Coma Friends Townsfolk Rich Urban Planning Mechanic Twist Ranching Store Online Earlier Time Unlocked Ranching Late Tree Existed Yak Hair Fun Fun Build Workshop Build House Build Skills Build Relationships Fun Overarching Story Multiplayer Iterate Town Progress Commissions Urban Planner Game Hangin Guys Progression Kinda Hard Times Combat Figuring Specific Tidbits Building Commissions Start Ramp Roam Map Ability Refine Commissions Constantly Wiki Guide Game Lot Games People Dead Set Relationships Npcs Slow People Lot Learn Game Lot Learn Food Recipes Minor Bugs Guessing Ironed Crash Lost Progress Perfect Game Portia Genre Absolutely Worth Picking,POSITIVE,1,0,42,4,0.9130434782608695

2023-11-04,"this is a general improvement of portia, with numerous qol improvements and better graphics.  if you want a chill builder sim game with a side of combat, this is a decent pick up.  that said there's a few things from the original that haven't improved:

-the combat is still too simplistic.  there are still no special attacks (the enemies get them, but not the player) so all you do for the most part is mash lmb and roll dodge once in a while.  there are ranged weapons, but having to constantly build more ammo is annoying so you'll just melee everything for the most part.
-the main story drags on way too long.  this was probably my main complaint about portia as well.  as another reviewer put it, there's an interesting major plotline where you fully expect the story to end afterwards but it drags on with more mundane busywork for another 10-15 hours.
-waiting on things.  you can speed up time to 3x speed at least without mods, but it can still take 15+ minutes of real time to smelt a stack of bars so a lot of the time you'll just toss stuff in and end the day to skip time.
-relation grind.  like the first game it is slow and tedious.  some characters aren't too bad because they constantly put up commissions which give a big chunk for something you want to do anyways, or are heavily involved in story missions.  others, like the doctor, require you go out of your way to talk to and constantly do boring crap like play critters (basically rock paper scissors with cards) over and over.  as a bonus middle finger, [spoiler]several characters leave partway through main story and get replaced by new ones[/spoiler].  hope you didn't waste your time on those ones!

overall though, it's a decent game for the price.  i never finished portia, i tried twice and got bored halfway through both times.  sandrock at least improved the gameplay enough to make me finish it this time.",16806,Improvement Portia Numerous Qol Improvements Graphics Chill Builder Sim Game Combat Decent Pick Original Improved Combat Simplistic Special Attacks Enemies Player Mash Lmb Roll Dodge Ranged Weapons Constantly Build Ammo Annoying Melee Main Story Drags Main Complaint Portia Reviewer Major Plotline Expect Story Drags Mundane Busywork 15 Hours Waiting Speed Time 3X Speed Mods 15 Minutes Real Time Smelt Stack Bars Lot Time Toss Stuff Day Skip Time Relation Grind Game Slow Tedious Characters Bad Constantly Commissions Chunk Heavily Involved Story Missions Doctor Require Talk Constantly Boring Crap Play Critters Basically Rock Paper Scissors Cards Bonus Middle Finger Spoiler Characters Leave Partway Main Story Replaced Spoiler Hope Waste Time Decent Game Price Finished Portia Bored Halfway Times Sandrock Improved Gameplay Finish Time,POSITIVE,1,0,56,7,0.8888888888888888

[b]what is my time at sandrock?[/b]
sandrock is a ""you come into a run down town to take over a run down activity to improve yourself and the city"" genre (stardew valley, coral island, portia, harvest moon, etc..) but here you are not a farmer, you are a builder in a post apocalyptic (but cute-ish) world.

you will have to gather resources, build stuff, take main quests as well as commisions, with time and gifts you will slowly win the hearth of the sandrockers, unlocking their personal stories while unfolding the story of sandrock.

[b]what are the pros of sandrock?[/b]
- [i]cosy gameplay:[/i] sandrock isn't much of a grinding game, yes it may happen that you will need an extra run into the caves to get the resources you need and sometimes you will have to wait for some ingots to smelt but it's not tedious or really long.
- [i]good story:[/i] this is the big improvement from portia, the story is nice and has a couple of twist, nothing incredible but also a welcome surprise for this series. townies have some better stories as well (compared to portia) and seem more entertaining.
- [i]lots of hours of gameplay:[/i] despite it's not the most replayable of games (if not for seeing how the different romance changes some dialogues), sandrock has a solid gameplay time, around 150 hours more or less

[b]what are the cons of sandrock?[/b]
- [i]late game content:[/i] like portia, sandrock has a problem with the late/end game part, even if some quest and sidequest, i can't ignore the fact that the last part of the game feels too empty (various days without anything major to do and no more personal sidequests from townies), buggy (translation quality drops hugely in late game as well as some bugged parts, showing more care in the development of the first and central part of the game rather than the late game) and overall less interesting than the previous parts. also the last townies that join the town don't have much dialogue lines (often resorting on generic talks) and aren't befriendable.
- [i]relations with townies are not a game changer:[/i] townies that have an important arc are added to the main quests (so there is no skipping or choice on them) while lesser arcs are left to the relationship rating but really don't add anything to the story. this makes the game not really replayable as there is no much impact on the game based on how you handle the relationships.
- [i]multiplayer:[/i] this is a bitter part for me, i backed the game hoping in a full co-op experience with my wife but halfway into the development the multiplayer was changed into a sort of sandbox experience with several goal steps and almost no story. it feels empty and boring in my opinion, the best choice would have been either make a stardew-valley like mp where players can experience the original story or simply not waste resources and time on it. an half-backed multiplayer mode will not satisfy anybody, if you seek a good co-op multiplayer, do not take sandrock into consideration",9102,Time Portia Skip Review Game Improvement Predecessor Stardew Valley Games Title Time Sandrock Sandrock Town Activity Improve City Genre Stardew Valley Coral Island Portia Harvest Moon Farmer Builder Post Apocalyptic Cute Ish Gather Resources Build Stuff Main Quests Commisions Time Gifts Slowly Win Hearth Sandrockers Unlocking Personal Stories Unfolding Story Sandrock Pros Sandrock Cosy Gameplay Sandrock Grinding Game Happen Extra Caves Resources Wait Ingots Smelt Tedious Story Improvement Portia Story Nice Couple Twist Incredible Surprise Series Townies Stories Compared Portia Entertaining Lots Hours Gameplay Replayable Games Romance Dialogues Sandrock Solid Gameplay Time 150 Hours Cons Sandrock Late Game Content Portia Sandrock Late Game Quest Sidequest Ignore Game Feels Days Major Personal Sidequests Townies Buggy Translation Quality Drops Hugely Late Game Bugged Care Development Central Game Late Game Previous Townies Town Dialogue Lines Resorting Generic Talks Befriendable Relations Townies Game Changer Townies Arc Main Quests Skipping Choice Lesser Arcs Left Relationship Rating Add Story Game Replayable Impact Game Based Handle Relationships Multiplayer Bitter Game Hoping Op Experience Wife Halfway Development Multiplayer Changed Sort Sandbox Experience Goal Steps Story Feels Boring Opinion Choice Stardew Valley Players Experience Original Story Simply Waste Resources Time Multiplayer Mode Satisfy Seek Op Multiplayer Sandrock Consideration,POSITIVE,1,0,76,10,0.8837209302325582

2023-11-21,"a worthy, quality sequel. “my time at portia” was a decent game, but “my time at sandrock” takes nearly all the ideas to the next level, making it hard to go back to the previous game.

the game does a good job of combining lore and gameplay elements, which is quite unusual and pleasant for the genre. thanks to the fact that the player has a goal from the very beginning, and the set of actions is mostly based on how the world is structured, the game feels cohesive. for example, the ability to plant crops is not just given because it’s necessary, but due to certain plot events, and it’s given by an npc. the process of growing plants, although a bit tedious and requires excessive micromanagement, is still justified by the game world: water is scarce, the soil isn’t the best, so you have to put in the effort.

there’s a lot of content in the game, it unfolds quite slowly, but that’s not a downside, because there’s always something for the player to do. both the main quest and all the side quests may not be tarantino-level in terms of execution, but they’re adequately composed, always capable of keeping the game interesting.

the game has a few downsides:

[olist]
[*]clunky controls coupled with a rather primitive camera behavior. for example, you need to press a separate button for aiming, after which the camera sensitivity seems to increase due to the change in the camera’s anchor point.
[*]extremely sparse, quite primitive animation. it reveals the budget nature of the project and hinders immersion.
[*]an excess of invisible walls, especially in the local dungeons. it feels like the authors set up the walls after prototyping the levels, but forgot to put up boxes and other obstacles blocking the path in some places or placed them too far away.
[*]useless multiplayer. there is a cooperative mode in name, but it’s very primitive and boring. the authors chose an earlier time period of the city when it was under construction, were too lazy to attach a decent plot, and just allowed several players to mess around in it at the same time.
[/olist]

overall, my time at sandrock is a worthy representative of the sandbox genre. the gameplay, except for the combat component, is decent, the plot is also decent, the graphics are decent, albeit with a specific stylization. against the backdrop of glitchy, unfinished games, this one looks pretty good.",9327,Worthy Quality Sequel Time Portia Decent Game Time Sandrock Takes Ideas Level Hard Previous Game Game Job Combining Lore Gameplay Elements Unusual Pleasant Genre Player Goal Set Actions Based Structured Game Feels Cohesive Ability Plant Crops Plot Events Npc Process Growing Plants Bit Tedious Requires Excessive Micromanagement Justified Game Water Scarce Soil Effort Lot Content Game Unfolds Slowly Downside Player Main Quest Quests Tarantino Level Terms Execution Adequately Composed Capable Keeping Game Game Downsides Olist Clunky Controls Coupled Primitive Camera Behavior Press Separate Button Aiming Camera Sensitivity Increase Change Camera Anchor Extremely Sparse Primitive Animation Reveals Budget Nature Project Hinders Immersion Excess Invisible Walls Local Dungeons Feels Authors Set Walls Prototyping Levels Forgot Boxes Obstacles Blocking Path Useless Multiplayer Cooperative Mode Primitive Boring Authors Chose Earlier Time Period City Construction Lazy Attach Decent Plot Allowed Players Mess Time Olist Time Sandrock Worthy Representative Sandbox Genre Gameplay Combat Component Decent Plot Decent Graphics Decent Albeit Specific Stylization Backdrop Glitchy Unfinished Games Pretty,POSITIVE,1,0,165,11,0.9375

2023-11-04,"basically portia in the desert.  it looks better and there's a lot more polish, and more importantly there's a number of qol improvements.  things like the game automatically taking things from your storage containers, sprint toggle, fast travel points being there from the start, etc.  the perk tree is also far more useful this time around.  the characters seem a little more interesting this time as well.  i still like the core gameplay concept more than most farming sims, as your money comes from doing commissions rather than just mass producing whatever is valuable and throwing it into a box.

that said there's still some issues from the first game, the biggest being the mobile game timers on all the crafting.  i sure do enjoy having to wait 10+ minutes of real life time to smelt some bars, and then another 5-10 minutes to turn those into whatever other parts your need.  you just kind of have to make 4-5 of each production machine, but then of course that means more resource gathering to fuel them.  just like the first game, a mod to make crafting faster would cut the game length in half.  the combat also hasn't improved at all.  you still just mash attack and do a dodge roll every so often, and that's it.  there's an armour break system now, but it gets trivialised once you find the '+1 break' skill on the perk tree and murder everything in seconds.

2023-11-21,"[i]my time at portia[/i] was a real surprise for me when i first played it. i'm pretty sure i got it in a bundle. it looked like someone had repurposed the assets of a korean mmo from 2010. but it turned out to be an unexpectedly feature rich game with an interesting post-apocalyptic worldbuilding, gameplay with genuinely novel ideas in combining the day-to-day work cycle and socializing of [i]harvest moon[/i] with softer factory game mechanics and combat, and just a good amount of content that was fun despite the jank.

[i]my time at sandrock[/i] takes all the good ideas of its predecessor which felt accidentally good at many times, and elevates them so you can make no mistake that pathea are actually a really talented and hardworking company that knows what they're doing. is it free of jank? no, not really. but it's so chockful of good things that even the jank becomes charming. it has a great, interesting story full of characters with vibrant personalities and not the paper-thin cutouts you get in [i]stardew valley[/i]. the world of the setting is so fully realized despite the series' cartoony nature and you feel excited to explore and learn about it. it is genuinely laugh out loud funny at many points, and genuinely emotional at others. i have to give it up for the vas who don't seem like professionals but are still giving their best. the building gameplay while its core loop is the same, sees a lot of qol improvements. the combat is more dynamic and offers a bit of challenge though it's still on the casual side. there's so many small charming details too, like when you go on dates in-game, they put in an animation where your significant other holds your hand. they didn't have to do that. it has no mechanical value. it's just cute and it makes you feel good.

stuff like that is why i think most of all, what the game nails is that it makes it good to be in sandrock, and to see sandrock grow. everyone who plays games for long enough understands the feeling where a place in a game becomes like a real place we have visited and been in, and we feel a sort of nostalgia seeing it. i think sandrock will feel that way to many people playing the game, it's such a wonderfully crafted setting, and it really fulfills the promise of the genre of ""life sim"" where you can take a break from reality and live somewhere else for a little while. i'm not even done with the main story. i restarted with 1.0 to experience it as intended since in beta lots of the quests squished together in buggy ways as they were implemented, but i feel glad to have done that. this is gonna be a game i will have good memories of and consider a favorite years from now.

2023-11-16,"pros:
•	gameplay: at core my time at sandrock has simple gameplay: to advance the story you need to build x thing. but before that you need diagram for it, for x items you need z number of materials which you can get with upgraded tools and in specific dungeon. basically, it is a very intricate dopamine infused web which works quite well.
•	graphics: a vast improvement over last entry my time at portia.
•	storyline: i really enjoyed that writers expanded the lore about overall state of the known world. there are no promises given, but they left nice options for future games. the characters are fleshed out nicely. they all have their things, motives, and stories.
•	voiceacting: kudos to all voice actors, they did a great job.

cons:
•	pacing: the game clearly wants you to stop and grind. probably it shouldn’t be a surprise at this kind of game, but it started getting ridiculous once i started getting 10-15 levels higher than me. i finished the game at level 43 and carried level 55 gear in inventory in hopes i will level up. the problem is that there aren’t that many activities to do that. unless you want to repeat same 3 dungeons all over again, search for some enemies in open areas or grind for materials. there are commissions too, but unfortunately a limited amount per day. 
same pacing issues with the story. it seems like at first the scope was smaller but as they got the funds from kickstarter they started adding more and more things. the ending feels like very long epilogue. it is better than previous game, but this could really be improved.
•	silent protagonist: are we saving the resources, or the idea was that voice will break the immersion. for me it is opposite. i got used to it, but please voice for next protagonist.

neutral:
•	technical performance: i have way above recommended system requirements, but last 15 hours was really a pain at times. characters loading slightly 2-3 seconds into the cutscene, overall, longer loading times, even game crashing few times. most of it is annoying. nothing game breaking. and i believe these things will be fixed, but for now be cautious and have patience. factory seems the most broken feature, but at the time of the writing there is already one fix released addressing it. i really like factory in previous game, in my mind this is a step backwards, but maybe it will be changed too.
•	audio: there are few great songs in the game. i would suggest improving on this, to maybe add a radio or more tracks.
verdict:
the game is a major improvement from the previous entry. i supported both games in kickstarter and will support another entry which will hopefully come. i rarely write reviews as detailed as this one, seems i really cared😊",11028,Pros Gameplay Core Time Sandrock Simple Gameplay Advance Story Build Diagram Items Materials Upgraded Tools Specific Dungeon Basically Intricate Dopamine Infused Graphics Vast Improvement Entry Time Portia Storyline Enjoyed Writers Expanded Lore Promises Left Nice Options Future Games Characters Fleshed Nicely Motives Stories Voiceacting Kudos Voice Actors Job Cons Pacing Game Grind Surprise Game Started Ridiculous Started 15 Levels Finished Game Level 43 Carried Level 55 Gear Inventory Hopes Level Activities Repeat 3 Dungeons Search Enemies Grind Materials Commissions Limited Day Pacing Issues Story Scope Funds Kickstarter Started Adding Feels Epilogue Previous Game Improved Silent Protagonist Saving Resources Idea Voice Break Immersion Voice Protagonist Neutral Technical Performance Recommended Requirements 15 Hours Pain Times Characters Loading 2 3 Cutscene Loading Times Game Crashing Times Annoying Game Breaking Fixed Cautious Patience Factory Broken Feature Time Writing Released Addressing Factory Previous Game Mind Step Changed Audio Songs Game Improving Add Radio Tracks Verdict Game Major Improvement Previous Entry Supported Games Kickstarter Support Entry Rarely Write Reviews Detailed Cared,POSITIVE,1,0,35,4,0.8974358974358975
2023-11-09,"i liked ""my time at portia"" in spite of what it needed still in terms of polish. it was an ambitious game with many of the things it tried felt mostly half baked and not fully flushed out.

i can happily say that ""my time at sandrock"" not only meets the levels set up by it's predecessor, but also far exceeds them. 

first, the game proudly sticks with it's theme. every aspect of this is themed around you being in a desert, from basic crafting to even fishing. on a side note, this is easily the better fishing mini games i've played, but i wont spoil how that works.

second, the story is very engaging. ~50ish hours in, i'm very immersed in the setting and very motivated to keep going. the characters all seem to have their own motivations and there's a plethora of areas where their quests have pay off, both big and small. the small, being a mark of true craftsmanship.

third, the relationship mechanics are fantastic. they don't expand the bare bones from the previous game (if it ain't broke don't fix it) but there's more to do around sandrock than portia. i do have a favorite addition though [spoiler] you literally hold hands with your partner when you're out on a date, they'll keep up with you as you run. this is the cutest damn thing in the world. bless whomever pushed that to get in because it was worth it.[/spoiler] 

if you've played the sequel, than this should be a no brainer. if you've not played the series, if not, i'd probably recommend going with the previous game first, but don't let that stop you if you're eager to start. there's nothing in portia that's critical for sandrock to be enjoyable.

post completion update: 
i still mostly stick by what i said, albeit with a few things to call out. first, the dlc is already in the game, but they want you to pay to unlock it. it's also not fun to get an in-game ad for it, basically. dragon age did the same and i hated it then, and i hate it now.

second, there's didn't seem to be any reaction to the person i ended up marrying (ellie, in my case). cooper seems like he'd be all about spending time with his grand kids.

and the ending [spoiler] a little abrupt. it wasn't bad, but i'd prefer to end on a higher note.

2023-11-26,"if you liked my time at portia, skip the review and buy the game, it's an overall improvement to his predecessor!

if you like ""stardew valley"" like games, this can be an interesting title for you!

[b]what is my time at sandrock?[/b]
sandrock is a ""you come into a run down town to take over a run down activity to improve yourself and the city"" genre (stardew valley, coral island, portia, harvest moon, etc..) but here you are not a farmer, you are a builder in a post apocalyptic (but cute-ish) world.

you will have to gather resources, build stuff, take main quests as well as commisions, with time and gifts you will slowly win the hearth of the sandrockers, unlocking their personal stories while unfolding the story of sandrock.

[b]what are the pros of sandrock?[/b]
- [i]cosy gameplay:[/i] sandrock isn't much of a grinding game, yes it may happen that you will need an extra run into the caves to get the resources you need and sometimes you will have to wait for some ingots to smelt but it's not tedious or really long.
- [i]good story:[/i] this is the big improvement from portia, the story is nice and has a couple of twist, nothing incredible but also a welcome surprise for this series. townies have some better stories as well (compared to portia) and seem more entertaining.
- [i]lots of hours of gameplay:[/i] despite it's not the most replayable of games (if not for seeing how the different romance changes some dialogues), sandrock has a solid gameplay time, around 150 hours more or less

[b]what are the cons of sandrock?[/b]
- [i]late game content:[/i] like portia, sandrock has a problem with the late/end game part, even if some quest and sidequest, i can't ignore the fact that the last part of the game feels too empty (various days without anything major to do and no more personal sidequests from townies), buggy (translation quality drops hugely in late game as well as some bugged parts, showing more care in the development of the first and central part of the game rather than the late game) and overall less interesting than the previous parts. also the last townies that join the town don't have much dialogue lines (often resorting on generic talks) and aren't befriendable.
- [i]relations with townies are not a game changer:[/i] townies that have an important arc are added to the main quests (so there is no skipping or choice on them) while lesser arcs are left to the relationship rating but really don't add anything to the story. this makes the game not really replayable as there is no much impact on the game based on how you handle the relationships.
- [i]multiplayer:[/i] this is a bitter part for me, i backed the game hoping in a full co-op experience with my wife but halfway into the development the multiplayer was changed into a sort of sandbox experience with several goal steps and almost no story. it feels empty and boring in my opinion, the best choice would have been either make a stardew-valley like mp where players can experience the original story or simply not waste resources and time on it. an half-backed multiplayer mode will not satisfy anybody, if you seek a good co-op multiplayer, do not take sandrock into consideration",9102,Time Portia Skip Review Game Improvement Predecessor Stardew Valley Games Title Time Sandrock Sandrock Town Activity Improve City Genre Stardew Valley Coral Island Portia Harvest Moon Farmer Builder Post Apocalyptic Cute Ish Gather Resources Build Stuff Main Quests Commisions Time Gifts Slowly Win Hearth Sandrockers Unlocking Personal Stories Unfolding Story Sandrock Pros Sandrock Cosy Gameplay Sandrock Grinding Game Happen Extra Caves Resources Wait Ingots Smelt Tedious Story Improvement Portia Story Nice Couple Twist Incredible Surprise Series Townies Stories Compared Portia Entertaining Lots Hours Gameplay Replayable Games Romance Dialogues Sandrock Solid Gameplay Time 150 Hours Cons Sandrock Late Game Content Portia Sandrock Late Game Quest Sidequest Ignore Game Feels Days Major Personal Sidequests Townies Buggy Translation Quality Drops Hugely Late Game Bugged Care Development Central Game Late Game Previous Townies Town Dialogue Lines Resorting Generic Talks Befriendable Relations Townies Game Changer Townies Arc Main Quests Skipping Choice Lesser Arcs Left Relationship Rating Add Story Game Replayable Impact Game Based Handle Relationships Multiplayer Bitter Game Hoping Op Experience Wife Halfway Development Multiplayer Changed Sort Sandbox Experience Goal Steps Story Feels Boring Opinion Choice Stardew Valley Players Experience Original Story Simply Waste Resources Time Multiplayer Mode Satisfy Seek Op Multiplayer Sandrock Consideration,POSITIVE,1,0,76,10,0.8837209302325582
2023-11-21,"a worthy, quality sequel. “my time at portia” was a decent game, but “my time at sandrock” takes nearly all the ideas to the next level, making it hard to go back to the previous game.

the game does a good job of combining lore and gameplay elements, which is quite unusual and pleasant for the genre. thanks to the fact that the player has a goal from the very beginning, and the set of actions is mostly based on how the world is structured, the game feels cohesive. for example, the ability to plant crops is not just given because it’s necessary, but due to certain plot events, and it’s given by an npc. the process of growing plants, although a bit tedious and requires excessive micromanagement, is still justified by the game world: water is scarce, the soil isn’t the best, so you have to put in the effort.

there’s a lot of content in the game, it unfolds quite slowly, but that’s not a downside, because there’s always something for the player to do. both the main quest and all the side quests may not be tarantino-level in terms of execution, but they’re adequately composed, always capable of keeping the game interesting.

the game has a few downsides:

[olist]
[*]clunky controls coupled with a rather primitive camera behavior. for example, you need to press a separate button for aiming, after which the camera sensitivity seems to increase due to the change in the camera’s anchor point.
[*]extremely sparse, quite primitive animation. it reveals the budget nature of the project and hinders immersion.
[*]an excess of invisible walls, especially in the local dungeons. it feels like the authors set up the walls after prototyping the levels, but forgot to put up boxes and other obstacles blocking the path in some places or placed them too far away.
[*]useless multiplayer. there is a cooperative mode in name, but it’s very primitive and boring. the authors chose an earlier time period of the city when it was under construction, were too lazy to attach a decent plot, and just allowed several players to mess around in it at the same time.
[/olist]

2023-11-15,"he's a 10, buuuuut.....

overall this is a pretty good game, and there's a lot of fun to be had in it. despite my negative review, i will keep playing it. and if you like games like stardew valley, you'll almost certainly like this one. the basic gameplay loop is fine - great even, if a little stale after awhile. and the story - likewise very enjoyable! the characters are, for the most part, unique and interesting and generally quite humorous. overall i should be able to recommend this game. so why don't i?

it's the little things. lots and lots of little things. for me, i play a game like this as a kind of escapism. i lose myself in the story and in getting to know the cast of characters - however cheesy it all might be. and in general, this game provides that better than most you might play, without the heaping dose of grim reality and tragedy you'll get from something like baldur's gate 3. it's a happy escapist fantasy. until you encounter (not bugs, because i did not encounter any that were not ultimately harmless and funny) some of the poorly or lazily implemented features.

obviously, you can date and marry and have kids with a good number of the characters. this is to be expected of this genre, and the process of getting to know these characters, through a variety of quests and events both focused on them and not, is quite a bit of fun. you will probably become quite invested in them. until you finish their content and they become hollow and uninteresting shells. they don't do or say anything new or interesting past a certain point - which is to be expected, but it is exacerbated by other things as i will point out. the dating/hangout mini game becomes a chore because after a couple of those you will have exhausted the dialogue with a given character - and that dialogue will not update even if you are actively in a relationship or married to the character. 

to make matters even worse, the story will not take any of this into account. whether or not you are dating a given character, or married to them even, will never come up outside of the one off wedding event or when talking to that character directly to get one of their canned lines of repetitive marriage dialogue - which are cute sure enough, but you can only hear them so many times before they lose all their charm. 

for a truly horrible example of how absurd this can get, at one point during the story you are to venture into a toxic environment full of extremely hostile enemies that want to kill you. all well and good, yea? well, if you are married to one of the characters involved, that character could be pregnant at the time of this quest. this does not come up...so your fun little happy escapism is irreparably ruined because the game is now sending your pregnant wife into a life and death situation because the smallest effort was not made to actually integrate the relationship and marriage system into the story in any way. 

and speaking of pregnancy, it's hilarious - from  a male character's perspective, i do not know how it differs if you play a female character and are the one to get pregnant. you will be teleported one morning to the hospital to see your spouse holding the baby, you will be prompted to name it, pick what the child will call you, and then you will be returned home. your spouse will be gone, already off following their preset schedule (which does not change even when you marry them by the way, they still follow the same routine as they do by default, except when it is interupted by the tasks you can choose to assign them). when you catch up to them...not a single damn mention of the baby they just pushed out. the entire system is barely implemented and it's kind of ridiculous. harvest moon 64 almost 30 years ago had a more robust and interesting system of marriage and children. what they've cobbled together here has the bones of something perfectly adequate, great even, but there is basically no connective tissue to bring it all together. 

overall, the game is quite good for what it is, and despite my negativity there is much to enjoy. but this is a life sim game, and the quite frankly pathetic implementation of some very important systems to the success of a game in that genre - dating, marriage, and children - leave a massive gaping hole in it. fixing these things would not even require a massive revamp of the game. just some basic time and care to make these choices feel as impactful as they should. lockout marriage until a point in the story where it cant create awkward situations, for example. implement new dialogues to accurately reflect relationship changes - despite all the voice acting a significant amount of the dialogue is unvoiced, so it is not even a question of needing to record new lines. just write more dialogue and shove it in there.",11594,Buuuuut Pretty Game Lot Fun Negative Review Playing Games Stardew Valley Basic Gameplay Loop Fine Stale Awhile Story Enjoyable Characters Unique Humorous Recommend Game Lots Lots Play Game Escapism Lose Story Cast Characters Cheesy Game Play Heaping Dose Grim Reality Tragedy Baldur Gate 3 Happy Escapist Fantasy Encounter Bugs Encounter Ultimately Harmless Funny Lazily Implemented Features Marry Kids Characters Expected Genre Process Characters Variety Quests Events Focused Bit Fun Invested Finish Content Hollow Uninteresting Shells Expected Exacerbated Dating Hangout Mini Game Chore Couple Exhausted Dialogue Character Dialogue Update Actively Relationship Married Character Matters Worse Story Account Dating Character Married Wedding Event Talking Character Canned Lines Repetitive Marriage Dialogue Cute Hear Times Lose Charm Horrible Absurd Story Venture Toxic Environment Extremely Hostile Enemies Kill Yea Married Characters Involved Character Pregnant Time Quest Fun Happy Escapism Irreparably Ruined Game Sending Pregnant Wife Life Death Situation Effort Integrate Relationship Marriage Story Speaking Pregnancy Hilarious Male Character Perspective Differs Play Female Character Pregnant Teleported Morning Hospital Spouse Holding Baby Prompted Pick Child Returned Spouse Preset Schedule Change Marry Follow Routine Default Interupted Tasks Choose Assign Catch Single Damn Mention Baby Pushed Entire Barely Implemented Ridiculous Harvest Moon 64 30 Robust Marriage Children Cobbled Bones Perfectly Adequate Basically Connective Tissue Bring Game Negativity Enjoy Life Sim Game Frankly Pathetic Implementation Systems Success Game Genre Dating Marriage Children Leave Massive Gaping Hole Fixing Require Massive Revamp Game Basic Time Care Choices Feel Impactful Lockout Marriage Story Create Awkward Situations Implement Dialogues Accurately Reflect Relationship Voice Acting Dialogue Unvoiced Question Record Lines Write Dialogue Shove,POSITIVE,1,0,42,1,0.9767441860465116
2023-11-15,"this is a hard one to judge. this game is a culmination of both what i love and hate about modern video games.

pros:
* the game loop isn't bad. it's similar to the predecessor and they didn't modify it much from there. 
* the characters in the game are pretty decent and distinct. some of them develop in unexpected ways which is neat.
* there ""larger than life"" events that do better than what its predecessor had.
* the conveniences later on are better than what was in its predecessor (with unfortunate caveats due to bugs).
* a cozy quality-of-life game.

cons:
* this game is buggy to a point i'm not sure how the hell it was released like it was. some of the bugs are similar to what i saw in early versions of its predecessor game which tells me they didn't learn much from their mistakes in implementation. i've made a list i can remember off the top of my head below.

* the combat is pretty weak. i didn't pay much attention to the early access but i was hoping they'd really make the combat more interesting. make no mistake that it's definitely better than what portia had. there's more variety here but it's literally ""smash the x button"" when you get down to it.

* after awhile, farming and mining stuff becomes repetitive which thankfully becomes easier. [strike]unfortunately, because the factory has such a fucked up implementation and literally doesn't work half the time, that convenience can be more irritating than helpful.[/strike] there's also no way to farm certain stuff or to get someone else to fetch it like agate. you have to go out and spend 5-10 minutes picking them 2 at a time. this isn't as big of a deal though, you don't generally need agate that often but for example, flourite you do since certain items that show up on commission require it to increase rarity. the only other way to get that is through ruin tokens which is already expensive and time consuming to obtain....

* some commissions are a trap. it might look easy but they want increased rarity on something like a steel bar which requires flourite to create which is an absolute pain in the ass to get. these commissions are never worth the gold they give (and they don't give much generally). they're there to make you feel miserable. the game should give double gold for such requests or triple gold for rare quality items.

all that said... i've already gotten over 100 hours out of it and i'll probably finish it. i'd wait for a sale but i'd be lying if i said i didn't enjoy it. there isn't really any challenge to it which kinda kills it a little bit. you can fail some stuff but you either have to try to fail it or fail it via a bug. 

bugs i saw while playing:
* literally first five minutes into the game, you'll notice that coco the bird fly's sideways and slow as if running into a wall. literally shows in one of the earliest cutscenes as you start playing.

* mobs and npcs end up your workshop seemingly lost, as if their pathing is telling them to go there for some reason and then they just literally run around doing nothing.

* soft locks are brimming in this game. they seem to be worse when you play the game for extended periods of time which brings me to...

* the game has some issues when played for long periods of time. things load slower or not at all, animations are wonkier, sound may not occur at all having you miss actually interesting voice lines.

* [strike]the factory you get later into the game is a broken mess. the ui doesn't update properly, parts of the ui doesn't work with controller for some reason, and multiple times now i've had the recycler ""production queue"" absolutely busted to where it was unusable. things that should produce more than one of a thing, for example bullets (5 each) or copper screws (2 each), will only produce one which is a clear bug since it shouldn't take fucking 20 steel bars and 50 gunpowder to make literally 10 rifle bullets, but doing the same thing directly on a forge would give you 50.[/strike] this was fixed in latest patch of this writing.

* npcs will fall to the bottom of the map, teleport endlessly, float in the sky or just out of reach, or not be able to interact with them at all until you leave the room or restart the game even.

* npc pathing will often put them smack dab in the middle of a cutscene where they mob pile to the point you can't see anything going on anymore.

* i've softlocked on a lot of scenes that want your character to automatically moved but apparently, i'm alone in this according to the forums.

* i've had the planting grid get stuck in 5x5 when in 4x4 mode, then plant incorrectly. this was with the robot: f machine. edit: there is a 5x5 mode later in the game but the robot isn't supposed to have it. 

* quests not triggering which would then fail after time passes.

* too many events scheduled at once. i had several quests on the same day as the day of memories, all at 1600.  they not only won't reschedule any of them, they also will cause bugs like not letting you join the ghost hunting event.

* probably more i'm not thinking of or too small of a bug to care.",11594,Hard Judge Game Culmination Love Hate Modern Video Games Pros Game Loop Bad Predecessor Modify Characters Game Pretty Decent Distinct Develop Unexpected Neat Larger Life Events Predecessor Conveniences Predecessor Unfortunate Caveats Bugs Cozy Quality Life Game Cons Game Buggy Released Bugs Versions Predecessor Game Tells Learn Mistakes Implementation List Remember Head Combat Pretty Weak Pay Attention Access Hoping Combat Mistake Portia Variety Literally Smash Button Awhile Farming Mining Stuff Repetitive Thankfully Easier Strike Factory Fucked Implementation Literally Time Convenience Irritating Helpful Strike Farm Stuff Fetch Agate Spend 5 Minutes Picking 2 Time Deal Agate Flourite Items Commission Require Increase Rarity Ruin Tokens Expensive Time Consuming Commissions Trap Easy Increased Rarity Steel Bar Requires Flourite Create Absolute Pain Ass Commissions Worth Gold Feel Miserable Game Double Gold Requests Triple Gold Rare Quality Items 100 Hours Finish Wait Sale Lying Enjoy Challenge Kinda Kills Bit Fail Stuff Fail Fail Bug Bugs Playing Literally Minutes Game Notice Coco Bird Fly Sideways Slow Running Wall Literally Earliest Cutscenes Start Playing Mobs Npcs Workshop Seemingly Lost Pathing Telling Reason Literally Soft Locks Brimming Game Worse Play Game Extended Periods Time Brings Game Issues Played Periods Time Load Slower Animations Wonkier Sound Occur Voice Lines Strike Factory Game Broken Mess Ui Update Properly Ui Controller Reason Multiple Times Recycler Production Queue Absolutely Busted Unusable Produce Bullets 5 Copper Screws 2 Produce Bug Fucking 20 Steel Bars 50 Gunpowder Literally Rifle Bullets Forge 50 Strike Fixed Patch Writing Npcs Fall Map Teleport Endlessly Float Sky Reach Interact Leave Restart Game Npc Pathing Smack Dab Middle Cutscene Mob Pile Softlocked Lot Scenes Character Automatically Moved Forums Planting Grid Stuck 5X5 4X4 Mode Plant Incorrectly Robot Machine Edit 5X5 Mode Game Robot Supposed Quests Triggering Fail Time Passes Events Scheduled Quests Day Day Memories 1600 Reschedule Bugs Letting Ghost Hunting Event Thinking Bug Care,POSITIVE,1,0,42,1,0.9767441860465116
2023-11-14,"if you love farming/building simulation games, you will most likely love this one. i have not even finished the game yet, but i wanted to post an honest and informative review while the game is at the height of attention. this is by far the #1 game in the genre for me. i normally do short and sweet reviews, but for a game like this i want to go over some of the important aspects of it that may make or break the players experience. so let me explain the good, the bad, and the ugly.

[b]the good[/b]:
-outstanding amount of content. you can see by my playtime that i have put in a significant amount of time. i have not even finished the main story yet, and i am not actually sure how close i am to the end. there is plenty of upgrades, levels, npc content, and building/farming to be done here

-you can have a farm with plants, chickens, buffalo, bunnies, and mounts

-there are about 20 or so romance-able npc's, all with their own character growth and story arcs along side the main story. some of them are very well done and interesting while others are not quite as fleshed out, but still enjoyable

-combat in the game is quick-paced hack-n-slash shoot-em-up style. there are ""dungeons"" to breeze through where you can get treasure, materials, and glory

-festivals are a lot of fun. you unlock more festivals as the game progresses and there are fun little mini games and unique events for each one of them.

-character creation is a bit similar to my time at portia and there are a lot of lore-friendly outfits and accessories you can use to personalize your builder. the hairstyles and coloring can be customized quite a bit to give you a unique look as well

-you can go on dates and hangout with the friends you meet in town, you can play mini games in an arcade and even mahjong at a later portion of the game.

-progression is slow but it feels great. every new house and machine upgrade you get feels like an achievement. you can upgrade your mounts, raise animals, have a huge farm, and it all feels earned. once you get more levels for your workshop and character and progress the main story you can automate collection of resources to help your progression quite a bit.

-the developers are awesome and are constantly replying to concerns and bug reports in the forums, as well as trying to improve the game.

[b]the bad[/b]:
-progression is slow. i know i stated this above, but people with not a lot of time on their hands may feel that they are not getting anywhere. a lot of this probably has a lot to do with how fast you decide to progress time. you can choose anywhere from 0.6x-3.0 time progression speed, and i believe that can have an impact on the pace of the game and how quickly it goes by. i like to take things slow and experience everything the game has to offer, so i have it set at 0.6.

-stamina and time can be hard to manage at first. you may feel a struggle early game trying to get the resources you need and finishing missions on time. this caveat goes away after getting some levels and experience under your belt. a lot of people feel a struggle at the beginning. taking the game slow is a good idea at the beginning until you get used to it.

-certain resources are very hard to get such as electronics, certain plants, trees, or animal resources. some of this stuff you need for progression but it is hard or impossible to automate in any way at the beginning. when you do commissions/missions for townsfolk, if you are not careful then you won't be able to complete them on time. this is why it is good to take it slow at the beginning and learn the ins-and-outs. this adds to early game struggle and gives a sense of not getting anywhere.

-some of the romance-able npc's don't really have much character development or story missions, decreasing their interesting aspect.

-the house building/decorating leaves much to be desired. it is difficult to place objects or know what objects to place in certain circumstances. the building ui is clunky and not user friendly. it can be struggle to get a look that you like. there are mismatched patterns or just plain ugly ones when making roofs or rooms. they honestly should have hired a color expert or interior decorator because some combinations of design can be atrocious. this part of the game is passable and you can get something that you are satisfied with, but it could take some workaround.

-workshop upgrades are incredibly expensive, to the point where you have to grind money for a long time to get room for all of the workshop add-ons, machines, and other goodies. it took me a good month of in game time to get an upgrade that would give me enough building space to extend my house because of how much money it was to get it. this part of the game feels a bit unbalanced, especially with how much money you will be spending elsewhere.

[b]the ugly[/b]
-this game is bethesda level buggy as of right now. i am not even remotely exaggerating. there are issues with npc's disappearing out of nowhere, floating mounts that you can't ride because they are stuck in the air, a visual bug that messes with some resource contracts, unclear missions markers or explanations etc.

-some missions have a timer on them. so you need to complete it in a certain number of days. there are several missions that you will fail for no reason at all with no in-game timer attached to them. these missions show no sign and give no hint of a fail-trigger, but if you don't do them then you will fail them at some point for what seems like no reason. i have had this happen a few times. this is usually with side missions. 

-you need to save a lot. there are some potentially game breaking bugs and missions you can screw up through no fault of your own, as stated above. it is a good idea to have several hard saves just in case something undesirable happens that messes up your progress with missions, npc's, or other aspects.

-the game does not run well sometimes. i get around ~60 fps pretty consistently, but certain areas, scenes, or events can cause huge framerate drops to as low as 15 fps, and i have had the game crash on me once. some people report even worse performance, but for me it is tolerable. i have a pretty decent gaming computer. i can run cyberpunk on max with a constant 60-70 fps, and this game performs slightly worse in certain cases. i will say that it seems they have ironed out some of this in the last week or so since my performance seems to have improved over the last couple days. in particular, when the train comes into town is one of the points where i get an fps drop to 15, but earlier today it did not drop when the train came in.

the game is by no means perfect, but it is my favorite game in the genre. if you liked portia or games like stardew valley, coral island, or any other popular sim games like this, then you will probably love this one. the developers are constantly looking at feedback and improving the game, so i am almost positive all of the negatives i pointed out will be fixed at some point in the future. they have already been actively releasing post-launch updates and they even intend to add more content eventually from what i have read. the developers and this game have my full confidence and support!

2023-11-14,"let's just get the important bit out of the way first: this is my 2023 game of the year. it was only a matter of when the game would come out of early access to claim its crown. since this game hit on nov. 2, i nominated it for the steam award.

now then, on to why this game is, as of this writing, my 6th most-played title in terms of hours on my steam account.

it's basically everything from my time at portia, but improved upon and made better in every possible way. the world is bigger, the building mechanics refined to a visible-from-space shine, the action rpg story fleshed out in a way that makes it the primary driver of gameplay rather than purely a framing device.

indeed, this is less a cozy game with action-rpg elements and more a reimagining of the action rpg formula where cozy game mechanics are the primary driver of progression. the genres blend seamlessly in a way that they never have before—looking at you, horizon zero dawn and forbidden west and every ubisoft game, where the crafting is tedious and feels unnecessary.

but at the same time, this game also has a cozy soul. if you're played any harvest moon-like, the life sim elements are exactly what you want them to be and then some. building relationships with villagers, romance, family life, it's all there with plenty of choices and some remarkably well-written relationship and character backstory dialogue. there are just so many ways to get a villager's friendship up compared to, say, stardew valley's more traditional talk-and-gift approach, and with the anti-frustration feature of not having to talk to every villager every day just to keep their relationship level from backsliding.

speaking of anti-frustration features, there are plenty more in this game as well. none of the main story quests are timed; complete them at your leisure. get overleveled if the combat's not your strong suit. rush the main story quests to unlock more of the crafting recipes if that's your jam. speedrunners and challenge runners? go to town, the game's got plenty of measurable ways to keep score. 

almost none of the sidequests are timed. if you unlock them too fast, as happens when you're powering through the main quest and hitting every character's sidequest trigger faster than you can bang them out, well, take a step back and take your time. the devs listened to players during the early access stage of the process and took the most common frustration—players felt rushed—out of the game. you want to complete them as fast as possible, nothing's stopping you. but it all fits in with the overarching theme of well-camouflaged accessibility that never feels like it's being dumbed down.

as for the action and combat in the action rpg, well, the devs know they're not from software. this isn't going to challenge anyone with a firm grounding in action games. you can overpower just about anything in the game because the devs have consciously avoided the bethesda syndrome of level-scaling enemies. well, with one exception—going too far afield in a sandstorm is going to surprise you the first time you run into high-level versions of basic enemies—but even that is a smart stylistic choice that makes sandstorms feel appropriately dangerous and threatening for a game set against the backdrop of a desert environment with a strong ""green aesop"" running through the main story.

is the game perfect? well, no, no game is perfect, not even games that are otherwise among the greatest of all time (i say this as someone who loved everything about red dead redemption 2 except for the on-rails quest design, for example.)

for one thing, the fishing minigame is one of the weakest i've seen in this genre. it's simplistic and repetitive and offers almost no challenge and very little reason to even engage with it beyond a couple of cooking recipes. this is a shame, especially since portia's fishing minigame was quite fun and other games like stardew, animal crossing (and dinkum, which cribs heavily from it), and even red dead 2 have great outdoorsman-style fishing gameplay.

in addition, there are a couple of dungeons in the midgame that have a jarring tonal shift toward platformer gameplay. thankfully the devs refined it a bit after its initial introduction; jumps are more forgiving, there's plenty of ""coyote time"" with ledges, and there's the option to skip the trickiest segments if you fail them enough times, but for a game that otherwise has good dungeon design, there's a heavy ""why, devs?"" when playing the two dungeons in question.

but those are minor quibbles in a game that is otherwise the absolute apex of the cozy game genre with one heck of a story rpg to go with it.

absolutely, by miles, my 2023 game of the year. 10/10.",12878,Bit 2023 Game Matter Game Access Claim Crown Game Hit Nov 2 Nominated Steam Award Game Writing 6Th Played Title Terms Hours Steam Account Basically Time Portia Improved Bigger Building Mechanics Refined Visible Space Shine Action Rpg Story Fleshed Primary Driver Gameplay Purely Framing Device Cozy Game Action Rpg Elements Reimagining Action Rpg Formula Cozy Game Mechanics Primary Driver Progression Genres Blend Seamlessly Horizon Dawn Forbidden West Ubisoft Game Crafting Tedious Feels Unnecessary Time Game Cozy Soul Played Harvest Moon Life Sim Elements Building Relationships Villagers Romance Family Life Plenty Choices Remarkably Written Relationship Character Backstory Dialogue Villager Friendship Compared Stardew Valley Traditional Talk Gift Approach Anti Frustration Feature Talk Villager Day Relationship Level Backsliding Speaking Anti Frustration Features Plenty Game Main Story Quests Timed Complete Leisure Overleveled Combat Strong Suit Rush Main Story Quests Unlock Crafting Recipes Jam Speedrunners Challenge Runners Town Game Plenty Measurable Score Sidequests Timed Unlock Fast Powering Main Quest Hitting Character Sidequest Trigger Faster Bang Step Time Devs Listened Players Access Stage Process Common Frustration Players Rushed Game Complete Fast Stopping Fits Overarching Theme Camouflaged Accessibility Feels Dumbed Action Combat Action Rpg Devs Software Challenge Firm Grounding Action Games Overpower Game Devs Consciously Avoided Bethesda Syndrome Level Scaling Enemies Exception Afield Sandstorm Surprise Time Level Versions Basic Enemies Smart Stylistic Choice Sandstorms Feel Appropriately Dangerous Threatening Game Set Backdrop Desert Environment Strong Green Aesop Running Main Story Game Perfect Game Perfect Games Time Loved Red Dead Redemption 2 Rails Quest Design Fishing Minigame Weakest Genre Simplistic Repetitive Offers Challenge Reason Engage Couple Cooking Recipes Shame Portia Fishing Minigame Fun Games Stardew Animal Crossing Dinkum Cribs Heavily Red Dead 2 Outdoorsman Style Fishing Gameplay Addition Couple Dungeons Midgame Jarring Tonal Shift Platformer Gameplay Thankfully Devs Refined Bit Initial Introduction Jumps Forgiving Plenty Coyote Time Ledges Option Skip Trickiest Segments Fail Times Game Dungeon Design Heavy Devs Playing Dungeons Question Minor Quibbles Game Absolute Apex Cozy Game Genre Heck Story Rpg Absolutely Miles 2023 Game,POSITIVE,1,0,49,3,0.9423076923076923
2023-11-14,"pretty full synopsis, no spoilers... except for the stupid actor part... which doesn't really spoil anything... it's the equivalent of saying, ""guy walks outside"" oh my gosh... he really did walk outside! spoilersss. i'm confident it wouldn't be the thing that kept me out of heaven by saying no spoilers...

if you liked my time at portia, you'll like this one. the controls are  basically the same with some minor differences that take getting used to. key difference i find amazing is that your storage is linked to your inventory when building, as well as most cases when giving gifts or completing quests. i found one instance where i couldn't give something in my storage and it's probably a bug. if a developer ever reads this, it was when one of the npc's was craving a ""copper plate"" i had to have it physically on me to give in that case... or maybe i'm dumb and haven't realized that all gifts must be in inventory to give and that's just a feature. in other words you don't need to spend hours organizing your storage... just throw it in and call it a day (except for clothes you want to keep... that's worth putting in it's own storage... everything else? who cares?)

relic hunting... is more exciting... maybe some won't like the change but i especially love it. instead of a giant cube room it's multiple floors of some building or something, and there are specific items you can get per floor. it makes it less of a ""find one of 50 relics which each have 2-7 pieces in this one giant room! didn't find them? well then do it all over again!"" now it's more like 5 relics per floor in a designed building that has multiple floors and start from whichever floor you want so long as you've gone deep enough to find the entrance to that floor. huge improvement in my book.

combat... i can't say about all the weapons... i started with the daggers tried, the others once, i love the daggers.... call me thorfin. 

combat is pretty similar to the old game, but just better. from armor breaking/staggering, to varying stats on the same item because of it's quality, which can range from low, to perfect, and then there's rare, which adds some cool features.... whether it's crafting, buying or finding. the items are all much more exciting in this game.

i was disappointed.... that everything feels mostly the same as the original game, but happy it's better. you're basically getting the same game but part two. 

the dialogue is mostly skipable, with the occasional choose your response, in which cases i regret not reading the dialogue... buuuut 95% of the time... totally skipable. unless i'm in a reading mood, i find it average, and occasionally good.

cut scenes.... are extremely lacking... it's like a low quality first time actor playing a major roll in a lead film, and the director says after each scene, ""cut.. that's a wrap... send it to production."" when they should've said, ""cut! that sucks! what are you doing! you're entering a scene where all the monsters are already gone, you've just barely shown up, and then you do a front roll into the room... from the middle of the room... you then aim your pistol, stand up, smile doing a finger spin with the pistol... catch it, blow the smoke off the tip of the pistol, when there is no smoke, because you haven't fired a single shot?... are you stupid? did you take acting lessons from stupid school? did you graduate top of your stupid class with stupid honors? because that was pretty stupid!""

now if they added a character to come in and say those exact words to that silly dude who did all those things... then it would've been hilarious, and we all would've understood... that's the stupid guy... but no, every cut scene is pretty much like that.

i love the game... plenty to make fun of, and critique, but that doesn't stop me from loving it. leave a comment/question if you have any specific inquiries.

dlc worth it?..... you aren't missing anything by not buying any of the dlc items... sure they'll give you a nice head start, but even though i had them i found myself not using any of them because i like starting a game with nothing and then building up to something awesome. if you're the same, save yourself a few bucks, otherwise if you just want some gear for some different looks, then maybe you'll like it.

character creation.... well at least you won't look like you have down syndrome in the game... unless that's what you're going for i'm sure you can pull it off!!! there is a major improvement on the quality of character in the creation tab... but i just want more!!! 

you really don't have a lot of options, and they don't leave you thinking, ""that character i made looks so bad a!!!"" it's more of a, ""well... i guess that's as good as it gets."" i liked how mine turned out, but it took 3 hours of messing around with every possibility, starting and deleting 3 games (the character never looks exactly the same in the game play)...before i finally got to ""my guy looks really kind of okay!""

(example... i put lipstic and changed the coloring on my guy to make him look like he had actual lips... not feminine lips... just dude lips... i get into the game... feminine af! deleted, and then did the same thing except made the lipstick lighter than what looked good... in the gameplay it looked pretty good. i mean.....i'm the equivalent of brad freaking pitt in this character creation screen! i look so good! kindof... joking aside i was happy with the final result. i can't say whether it's the same for making a girl since i didn't try.)

2023-11-12,"[h1] my time at sandrock: an amazingly massive game, a great story line, and some occasional faults. ~ [/h1]

[h3] okay, so i have obviously played this game a lot, and it's because it is that good! if you're a return player from portia, i can confirm to you that sandrock is a massive upgrade in almost all aspects! if you have never played a game in the my time at series, don't worry! you absolutely do not have to play portia to enjoy sandrock! after over 200 hours of game play, here's my major takeaways ~ [/h3]

[u] the great ~ [/u] 

[b] the story line [/b]
- sandrock has a really great main story quest line, with enough twist and turns to keep you interested and immersed. it truly was a pleasure to play through it! there's a good mix of resource gathering, social aspects, combat, farming, and advancement required that keeps you motivated to continue grinding towards completion. also, if you're a return player from portia, i personally believe that sandrock has a better story line, and has increased difficulty.
[b] the characters [/b]
- wow! sandrock truly has some very colorful characters! without giving anything away, these side characters have a variety of personalities that are genuinely fun to interact with. in a lot of other games from this genre i tend to stop talking to a lot of the npcs around town, but i actually like hearing what the characters in sandrock have to say! it also helps that every character is given new unique dialogue after progress in the story is made, so they're not just constantly spouting the same lines all the time, regardless of development. there's a lot of great romance options as well, with there being someone for everyone. 
[b] the dialogue [/b]
- there's no other way to say this ~ this game just has straight up hilarious lines! from a farmer who's a part-time conspiracy theorist to a rock obsessed wannabe deputy, there's no shortage of great lines from the characters around the game. the dialogue also makes you want to befriend more of the citizens to see their extra events because of how hilarious they can be. your player character can even give some golden one-liners as the game progresses! 
[b] the grind [/b] 
- you really have to get involved in all aspects of the game when playing. you're going to need a lot of wood to complete projects, i mean, you are a builder. however, sandrock is desolate and cutting down trees and cacti is a big no-no. this means you have to cut down tiny bushes, dead logs, etc. which do not give you a lot of resources, meaning you've got to keep at the grind! also, as you unlock more areas and more of the story, you find yourself having to go back to previous ruins/areas in order to get different types of materials, as they're not in the same place. don't forget that water powers all of your machines, so you have to keep your tank full in the middle of the desert! 

[u] the lacking~ [/u]

[b] the family issue [/b]
- in short, because there's so many elements in sandrock, they eventually fizzle out in unsatisfactory ways. a good example can be seen with married and family life, which is just not fleshed out enough. considering characters around the game continuously sing praises towards your character, and comment on the various things going on around, it's strange that basically nobody acknowledges your spouse and children. so far, there's no family events, and once your children exit the baby stage, you literally never see them interact with anyone, including your spouse. they wake up and essentially go to one place (the train station) for the entire day.  it would've been nice to have them as actual members of the town, with their own events as they age, and a routine that mimics other npcs. as for your spouse, the married events currently in game are very boring and out of place for some characters. i would really love to see married life and family life be more fleshed out in the future, whether in another my time game, or in an expansion/update! i would rather have less romance options and just one child if that means that the additional content that comes with them would be stronger. 
[b] character favoritism + strange depth [/b]
- it's very obvious that, because of fan reception, some characters are more favored than others. by this i mean that they have way more content. take fang and logan as an example. both characters are fan favorites, and they have some really cool events! these events also work really well with what has been presented with their characters, which gives not only their characters, but the game, more depth. it really makes you believe that they had a life before you, and have a life despite you. i suppose this makes me more critical of the other characters in the game. director qi is a good example of this. you actually get to know so much about his character! for example, he's the grandson of a successful scientist who appears to be very strict, his parent's had more ""lowly"" jobs in comparison and qi appears to sort of look down on them, and he even states that his parents were shocked to find out that you exist (if you romance him), and that when he was younger he calculated that there was only a 3.14% chance of him finding love. these all combine to create such an interesting character, and gives you a plethora of ideas of how his character will/can progress. however, despite these tidbits that you can gather, that's basically it. his character, as well as a large portion of characters in the game, plateau. this is what i mean about strange depth, it's like they had more planned for certain characters, and it just never came to fruition. i was so certain when romancing qi's character that there was going to be some really cool events regarding his past, him falling in love with you, having children of his own, etc., and it just never happened. it honestly was a big disappointment because i saw all the makings of a great side story for a lot of the romance-able characters, but it's just not there. 

[h3] in conclusion, i honestly feel like i have so much more to say, which isn't surprising considering how much i loved the game. additionally, i would say that because i love the game and series so much i am probably more critical of it in certain ways! i think that's truly the hallmark sign of a great game, liking it so much that you want to make certain changes to perfect it! all in all, sandrock was truly an amazing experience and i would recommend it to all lovers of the genre. however, keep in mind that there are going to be aspects of the game that will leave you frustrated. these frustrations, at least for me, have a lot to do with the fact that i just want more! keep it up devs! you're doing great sweeties, and the improvement from portia is massive!

2023-11-11,"overall, i recommend the game - 480 hours played across early release - but that doesn't mean the game is perfect. much has been made of the voiceover issues with this game, so i'll bypass those, other than to add that changing the voiceover artist for later updates compounded the issue.

it's less clunky (although arguable less realistic, as a consequence) than its predecessor, my time at portia, which may make for a less than satisfying experience for anyone who chooses to play that game after this one. the characters in sandrock are less bobble-headed, too, which is an improvement. portia and sandrock happen in a simultaneous timelime, which leads to some quietly-amusing references to, effectively, your portia character at points during sandrock, another reason to consider playing portia first.

of the five bachelors i romanced, three of them exhibited behaviour that, in real life, should set major alarm bells ringing, which is quite concerning. a couple of the npcs are genuinely unlikeable, which is fine and reflective of real life; but i found myself resenting completing lucrative contracts for one of them by late game, as their relationship with me continued to increase even as my loathing of them grew.

as i did play this through early release, some things may have changed by full release, but a few niggly annoyances stood out: at times, lucrative commissions for machinery would appear on the commission board; but without having any in-game ability to know what was required to complete construction, it was quite frustrating to accept these commissions, research the manufacturing plans, discover you needed more advanced equipment yourself, research that, then find that you needed components you either didn't have materials for, or didn't have the ability to make. in one instance, the 'base' instructions for making the refined material i needed to make one component didn't even become available until nearly two months after i'd failed the commission. if the capacity to complete the commission doesn't exist, don't make it available.

secondly, there were times when it became impossible to complete tasks because the final act clashed with some other event. some of these may have since been resolved. in a related annoyance, there are times when the pc wakes up with awareness of events it is literally impossible for them to have any knowledge of. often this is minor: calendar events added on rising in the morning that are explained when mail is read. occasionally, however, these are quite significant. just as bed, there are some events involving npcs that clearly acknowledge the passage of a significant period of time (a minimum two weeks would be essential in one case), yet those events conclude within a day or so. then there is the issue of being 'transported' to major events when you get up. on one occasion, running back home after such an event, i encountered a minor task simply by talking with an npc that i had no means of answering because the task was outlined in a letter i hadn't yet had a chance to read. more concerningly, the non-committal answer i gave may have broken the character, who never moved from the spot i encountered him for the remainder of the game, unless needed elsewhere.

the nanny-nag that says ""you can't use that possibly rude word!"" when naming things in single-player is both ludicrous and offensive: i'm an adult, not six years old, and i can make my own decisions. if it's important that any vaguely-implied rudeness must be leapt on with extreme prejudice, then i would suggest that eliminating toxic behaviours from a multitude of npcs would be a better use of censorship - especially if (and i am forced to assume that this must be the case) the game makers are trying to avoid corrupting sweet childish innocence.

similarly, an in-game swimwear fashion show basically designed to sell dlcs is both sexist and cowardly in dressing the female models in bikins and the males in shorts. the game designers may have jumped on the 'it's okay to be gay"" bandwagon; but their moral code is severely lacking in other areas (most particularly regarding toxic behaviours).

one in-game shop has a link to actual character figurines on amazon: if you follow the link you find that you're being asked to pay an offensively-large amount of money for a blind-box figurine, so that's a definitive 'no' on both counts. still, that annoyance is easily-avoided, although it does make me less-inclined to consider buying other pathea games products, up to and including dlcs, so they may like to rethink their approach.

yes, i have concentrated on the negatives in this review. on the positive side, the game is immensely-playable. for an obsessive such as me, there is always something to do, with the essential wait-times scattered throughout the game usually not too much of a trial. some npcs are clearly on the autism spectrum, and this is treated respectfully (albeit occasionally with not-unreasonable impatience) by other npcs and player choices, which is to be commended. apart from some built-in sexism, the character design is generally appealing, and the capacity to 'hide the hat' via the settings is appreciated: having put a lot of effort into designing my character, i like being able to see them. the storylines are often engaging, although i wish the character-based relationship-building tasks had a time expiry if unselected, because having them sit constantly on the map when i have no interest in following them through is annoying.

in summary, an enjoyable, very playable game with a number of flaws, some of them significant.",18231,Recommend Game 480 Hours Played Release Game Perfect Voiceover Issues Game Bypass Add Changing Voiceover Artist Updates Compounded Issue Clunky Arguable Realistic Consequence Predecessor Time Portia Satisfying Experience Chooses Play Game Characters Sandrock Bobble Headed Improvement Portia Sandrock Happen Simultaneous Timelime Leads Quietly Amusing References Effectively Portia Character Sandrock Reason Playing Portia Bachelors Romanced Exhibited Behaviour Real Life Set Major Alarm Bells Ringing Couple Npcs Genuinely Unlikeable Fine Reflective Real Life Resenting Completing Lucrative Contracts Late Game Relationship Continued Increase Loathing Grew Play Release Changed Release Niggly Annoyances Stood Times Lucrative Commissions Machinery Commission Board Game Ability Required Complete Construction Frustrating Accept Commissions Manufacturing Plans Discover Advanced Equipment Components Materials Ability Instance Base Instructions Refined Material Component Months Failed Commission Capacity Complete Commission Exist Times Impossible Complete Tasks Final Clashed Event Resolved Annoyance Times Pc Wakes Awareness Events Literally Impossible Knowledge Minor Calendar Events Rising Morning Explained Mail Read Occasionally Bed Events Involving Npcs Acknowledge Passage Period Time Minimum Weeks Essential Events Conclude Day Issue Transported Major Events Occasion Running Event Encountered Minor Task Simply Talking Npc Answering Task Outlined Letter Chance Read Concerningly Committal Answer Broken Character Moved Spot Encountered Remainder Game Nanny Nag Rude Word Naming Single Player Ludicrous Offensive Adult Decisions Vaguely Implied Rudeness Leapt Extreme Prejudice Eliminating Toxic Behaviours Multitude Npcs Censorship Forced Assume Game Makers Avoid Corrupting Sweet Childish Innocence Game Swimwear Fashion Basically Designed Sell Dlcs Sexist Cowardly Dressing Female Models Bikins Males Shorts Game Designers Jumped Gay Bandwagon Moral Code Severely Lacking Toxic Behaviours Game Shop Link Actual Character Figurines Amazon Follow Link Pay Offensively Money Blind Box Figurine Definitive Counts Annoyance Easily Avoided Inclined Buying Pathea Games Products Including Dlcs Rethink Approach Concentrated Negatives Review Positive Game Immensely Playable Obsessive Essential Wait Times Scattered Game Trial Npcs Autism Spectrum Treated Respectfully Albeit Occasionally Unreasonable Impatience Npcs Player Choices Commended Built Sexism Character Design Appealing Capacity Hide Hat Settings Appreciated Lot Effort Designing Character Storylines Engaging Character Based Relationship Building Tasks Time Expiry Unselected Sit Constantly Map Annoying Summary Enjoyable Playable Game Flaws,POSITIVE,1,0,53,15,0.7794117647058824
2023-11-11,"having played portia, and having played this a bit while in ea, i can definitively say that this is a straight upgrade in many ways compared to the previous game and that time spent in ea was well spent to make a generally well-polished experience on release. 

the thing that stood out to me as vastly improved in comparison to portia is the combat, which, for a game that has utilized this mechanic in a more intimate way that other farming/building/life simulation games, i think really nails the good balance in necessity to being enjoyable to engage with. especially when you start upgrading the combat skills, getting more combos, getting the flow of the enemy actions and dodging and timing strikes, while not particularly profound, still feels enjoyable and far more engaging than the previous games and others in the same genre i've experienced. it feels simple enough though that even if you're not really playing this game to partake in the combat-portion of the game, it's easy enough to out-level the enemies by performing other tasks that simple button mashing to get the mats you need from lower level monsters won't pose much of an obstacle.

outside of combat, i've always enjoyed the commission system in both games, and i think it serves well here for giving yourself a sense of progression and direction. while being rewarding enough that, while being somewhat repetitive in what you'll be building for the various residents of sandrock, serves more as the foundation for pursuing other enjoyable ventures like upgrading your workshop, buying mats that you need either directly at stores or commissioning deliveries while giving you enough of a reward in not only the money you need, but additional materials and easy relationship improvements outside of the, arguably, rather shallow and repetitive npc conversational engagements quickly enough to give you variety in other things to do without feeling like too much of a grind.

the story is also rather cute, if not a bit on the simple side, which imo, is fine for what it is - it gives you a further sense of purpose and a meaningful way to progress unlockable areas, residents, and mechanics. i feel several of the npcs have notable quirks that make them memorable enough to want to engage with them and their missions, although at times, even with the characters that are not designed to be long-winded (like cooper), i found myself wanting to read the dialog faster than i wanted to hear it from them because there's just something about the way they talk and the flow that just made me frequently want to skip it. can't really put my finger on why exactly, but this was especially true when interacting with them daily during the regular chat interactions. with that said though, one really nice touch is how npcs all have their own individual reactions to story events that are enjoyable to listen to, even if they can be a bit long-winded sometimes. it's a nice touch to detail that somewhat makes your accomplishments in the game feel more relevant to your place in the world.

lastly, while i haven't played much of it since ea, the multiplayer seems way more polished (and was non-existent in the previous game) and has been pretty fun so far. if you've got friends to play with, while it's completely separate from the base instance of the game, the co-op workspace and co-op commissions and being able to engage in spelunking and combat with friends gives it a fresh feel from the base, single-player, portion of the game.

- solid improvement from the previous game in almost every way.
- combat improvements especially feel much better from previous games.
- story is fine, albeit a bit on the simple side. more focus made on the mechanics.
- many npcs are memorable in their own way if not a bit long-winded and the base chat mechanic is a bit bleh but the ""play"" mechanics make up for it a bit (albeit, get a bit repetitive with the limited options and expensive energy costs to engage in them).

2023-11-09,"i liked ""my time at portia"" in spite of what it needed still in terms of polish. it was an ambitious game with many of the things it tried felt mostly half baked and not fully flushed out.

i can happily say that ""my time at sandrock"" not only meets the levels set up by it's predecessor, but also far exceeds them. 

first, the game proudly sticks with it's theme. every aspect of this is themed around you being in a desert, from basic crafting to even fishing. on a side note, this is easily the better fishing mini games i've played, but i wont spoil how that works.

second, the story is very engaging. ~50ish hours in, i'm very immersed in the setting and very motivated to keep going. the characters all seem to have their own motivations and there's a plethora of areas where their quests have pay off, both big and small. the small, being a mark of true craftsmanship.

third, the relationship mechanics are fantastic. they don't expand the bare bones from the previous game (if it ain't broke don't fix it) but there's more to do around sandrock than portia. i do have a favorite addition though [spoiler] you literally hold hands with your partner when you're out on a date, they'll keep up with you as you run. this is the cutest damn thing in the world. bless whomever pushed that to get in because it was worth it.[/spoiler] 

if you've played the sequel, than this should be a no brainer. if you've not played the series, if not, i'd probably recommend going with the previous game first, but don't let that stop you if you're eager to start. there's nothing in portia that's critical for sandrock to be enjoyable.

post completion update: 
i still mostly stick by what i said, albeit with a few things to call out. first, the dlc is already in the game, but they want you to pay to unlock it. it's also not fun to get an in-game ad for it, basically. dragon age did the same and i hated it then, and i hate it now.

second, there's didn't seem to be any reaction to the person i ended up marrying (ellie, in my case). cooper seems like he'd be all about spending time with his grand kids.

and the ending [spoiler] a little abrupt. it wasn't bad, but i'd prefer to end on a higher note.

2023-11-01,"i talked to a phone booth in the game that told me to leave a review with feedback, so i'm gonna do that!

this game's totally worth the asking price as-is, really elevates the farm life genre beyond stardew valley in pretty much every way (i loved stardew!), and offers a scintillating post-apocalyptic desert setting that feels really novel.

this game clearly has a lot to say about the way capital and a self-serving government can funnel money to prop up those who are already successful whilst leaving struggling communities to languish. there are tons of quests and side quests where characters ask if you can spot them money because the economy in sandrock is awful, and public servants will frequently lament the difficulty the town has getting government grants and the belief the residents should 'just move somewhere nicer' without regard for the town's unique culture or the financial hurdles one must jump over to be able to afford moving.

i'm still not done with the game's main story line even 80 hours in, but i'm excited to see how it further develops arguments between characters about the potential perils of technological advancement, because it seems like the game's religious faction is on the verge of lashing out at sandrock's local government for making use of scientific advancements to try and make the desert environment more habitable.

the game's premise also allows it to offer critique on world politics and modern society from the perspective of characters who are discovering information about us hundreds of years in the future. in the 'my time at' series' lore, to really simplify it, technology progressed with little oversight or regulation which made it trivially easy to start a world war that decimated most (all?) of the planet's surface and plunged the world into a new dark age, with people living underground until they were able to return to the surface and rebuild on top of the ruins.

i was surprised by the way this game tackles criticisms of the genre as being centered on mindless extractivism; the rationing of water from the local supply is a serious gameplay factory to account for, the logistical challenges of importing water from other towns is discussed frequently, and you're told as soon as you start the game that logging is illegal due to how few trees there are. plus there's a serious focus on scavenging for scraps and re-purposing those into materials.

this game really surprised me; i had kind of written it off because i thought the art style was a touch off-putting, but the narrative, character writing, and gameplay loops have all charmed and hooked me.

now, because that phone booth said the developers read reviews of the game for feedback, here's some very specific complaints i'd like addressed:

1. i'm in the summer of year two, partway through the bronco the kid quests, and i keep getting building commissions for items i cannot complete because i haven't met musa yet, which means i haven't gained access to the areas that unlock when he shows up in town. some of the commissions i've seen posted but can't complete are industrial machine tools, the advanced civil processor, and chromium daggers. i have these recipes already because i've been diligent about doing machine research with qi and buying recipes from the commerce guild, but i think the game should check to see whether the player has the ability to get the materials necessary to make something before it pops up as a commission.

2. after you first get the chance to express romantic interest in elsie, there's a line of dialogue where she declares 'i'm a legal adult' in frustration at the way her parents treat her. i appreciate the effort to make it clear she's not too young to ethically date, but she's very childish, and that line just makes her sound more childish. the mention of legality feels like a reassurance to the player, which doesn't make for good character dialog.

3. at some point, jumping with my camel started causing the game to freeze in the air for a half-second, after which it hits the ground and all four hoof-hitting-ground sounds play one right after the other. i swear the jumping animation used to be way smoother without that hitch and without the weird sound; i don't have performance issues in this game, so it's not lag as far as i can tell.

4. sometimes machines will get stuck saying they need to have the sand cleaned out of them, and no matter how many different positions or angles i try i cannot see a sand pile to remove with my duster. i found that picking the machine up and putting it back down fixes it temporarily, but i would prefer to just not have that issue, it's annoying having to finesse the position of a civil furnace that sits between two other furnaces.

5. i need storage to be sortable across all boxes instead of the 'sort' option just sorting that individual storage box, as well as the ability to search for an item in storage by name. i would also like for storage to always be accessible when you're gifting a character something. it's frustrating going through my 10? 12? large storage boxes, each with two pages of items to scroll through, especially since item names are only visible by using the left stick and going over every item.

6. finding relic parts for qi's side quests is too time consuming. i would prefer the quest-necessary relic pieces be located in chests in the ruins rather than in the dirt; i haven't found the scanner particularly effective at locating the quest pieces, so i've just been hitting every piece of dirt i can find on every floor hoping to uncover a relic piece eventually, which is extremely tedious when i also really need to move on to a new floor for the ores so i have the materials to complete my commissions.

7. the lack of tin scrap makes bronze more difficult to craft than stuff like chromium or manganese steel, and i'm not sure why that's the case given bronze is required for crafting so many different things.

8. there should be an option to turn on alerts for commissions that are going to expire that day. even if you're tracking your commissions that are due the soonest, you won't see when the commission expires on the main screen.

9. the shop interface should tell you whether clothing/accessories are better or worse than your current gear; i can't really compare my gear when it's all named something like 'stunt rider desert warrior visor' or 'bright defense team boots' since those names don't convey anything about their stats. it's also a struggle to remember my shirt provides, for example, '+136 health + 17 stamina +5% critical hit chance + negates poison status effects' when i'm in a shop going through a bunch of different shirts all with different stat buffs and effects.

2023-11-11,"having played portia, and having played this a bit while in ea, i can definitively say that this is a straight upgrade in many ways compared to the previous game and that time spent in ea was well spent to make a generally well-polished experience on release. 

the thing that stood out to me as vastly improved in comparison to portia is the combat, which, for a game that has utilized this mechanic in a more intimate way that other farming/building/life simulation games, i think really nails the good balance in necessity to being enjoyable to engage with. especially when you start upgrading the combat skills, getting more combos, getting the flow of the enemy actions and dodging and timing strikes, while not particularly profound, still feels enjoyable and far more engaging than the previous games and others in the same genre i've experienced. it feels simple enough though that even if you're not really playing this game to partake in the combat-portion of the game, it's easy enough to out-level the enemies by performing other tasks that simple button mashing to get the mats you need from lower level monsters won't pose much of an obstacle.

outside of combat, i've always enjoyed the commission system in both games, and i think it serves well here for giving yourself a sense of progression and direction. while being rewarding enough that, while being somewhat repetitive in what you'll be building for the various residents of sandrock, serves more as the foundation for pursuing other enjoyable ventures like upgrading your workshop, buying mats that you need either directly at stores or commissioning deliveries while giving you enough of a reward in not only the money you need, but additional materials and easy relationship improvements outside of the, arguably, rather shallow and repetitive npc conversational engagements quickly enough to give you variety in other things to do without feeling like too much of a grind.

the story is also rather cute, if not a bit on the simple side, which imo, is fine for what it is - it gives you a further sense of purpose and a meaningful way to progress unlockable areas, residents, and mechanics. i feel several of the npcs have notable quirks that make them memorable enough to want to engage with them and their missions, although at times, even with the characters that are not designed to be long-winded (like cooper), i found myself wanting to read the dialog faster than i wanted to hear it from them because there's just something about the way they talk and the flow that just made me frequently want to skip it. can't really put my finger on why exactly, but this was especially true when interacting with them daily during the regular chat interactions. with that said though, one really nice touch is how npcs all have their own individual reactions to story events that are enjoyable to listen to, even if they can be a bit long-winded sometimes. it's a nice touch to detail that somewhat makes your accomplishments in the game feel more relevant to your place in the world.

lastly, while i haven't played much of it since ea, the multiplayer seems way more polished (and was non-existent in the previous game) and has been pretty fun so far. if you've got friends to play with, while it's completely separate from the base instance of the game, the co-op workspace and co-op commissions and being able to engage in spelunking and combat with friends gives it a fresh feel from the base, single-player, portion of the game.

[h3][u]tl:dr[/u][/h3]
- solid improvement from the previous game in almost every way.
- combat improvements especially feel much better from previous games.
- story is fine, albeit a bit on the simple side. more focus made on the mechanics.
- many npcs are memorable in their own way if not a bit long-winded and the base chat mechanic is a bit bleh but the ""play"" mechanics make up for it a bit (albeit, get a bit repetitive with the limited options and expensive energy costs to engage in them).

2023-11-26,"if you liked my time at portia, skip the review and buy the game, it's an overall improvement to his predecessor!

if you like ""stardew valley"" like games, this can be an interesting title for you!

[b]what is my time at sandrock?[/b]
sandrock is a ""you come into a run down town to take over a run down activity to improve yourself and the city"" genre (stardew valley, coral island, portia, harvest moon, etc..) but here you are not a farmer, you are a builder in a post apocalyptic (but cute-ish) world.

you will have to gather resources, build stuff, take main quests as well as commisions, with time and gifts you will slowly win the hearth of the sandrockers, unlocking their personal stories while unfolding the story of sandrock.

[b]what are the pros of sandrock?[/b]
- [i]cosy gameplay:[/i] sandrock isn't much of a grinding game, yes it may happen that you will need an extra run into the caves to get the resources you need and sometimes you will have to wait for some ingots to smelt but it's not tedious or really long.
- [i]good story:[/i] this is the big improvement from portia, the story is nice and has a couple of twist, nothing incredible but also a welcome surprise for this series. townies have some better stories as well (compared to portia) and seem more entertaining.
- [i]lots of hours of gameplay:[/i] despite it's not the most replayable of games (if not for seeing how the different romance changes some dialogues), sandrock has a solid gameplay time, around 150 hours more or less

[b]what are the cons of sandrock?[/b]
- [i]late game content:[/i] like portia, sandrock has a problem with the late/end game part, even if some quest and sidequest, i can't ignore the fact that the last part of the game feels too empty (various days without anything major to do and no more personal sidequests from townies), buggy (translation quality drops hugely in late game as well as some bugged parts, showing more care in the development of the first and central part of the game rather than the late game) and overall less interesting than the previous parts. also the last townies that join the town don't have much dialogue lines (often resorting on generic talks) and aren't befriendable.
- [i]relations with townies are not a game changer:[/i] townies that have an important arc are added to the main quests (so there is no skipping or choice on them) while lesser arcs are left to the relationship rating but really don't add anything to the story. this makes the game not really replayable as there is no much impact on the game based on how you handle the relationships.
- [i]multiplayer:[/i] this is a bitter part for me, i backed the game hoping in a full co-op experience with my wife but halfway into the development the multiplayer was changed into a sort of sandbox experience with several goal steps and almost no story. it feels empty and boring in my opinion, the best choice would have been either make a stardew-valley like mp where players can experience the original story or simply not waste resources and time on it. an half-backed multiplayer mode will not satisfy anybody, if you seek a good co-op multiplayer, do not take sandrock into consideration",9102,Time Portia Skip Review Game Improvement Predecessor Stardew Valley Games Title Time Sandrock Sandrock Town Activity Improve City Genre Stardew Valley Coral Island Portia Harvest Moon Farmer Builder Post Apocalyptic Cute Ish Gather Resources Build Stuff Main Quests Commisions Time Gifts Slowly Win Hearth Sandrockers Unlocking Personal Stories Unfolding Story Sandrock Pros Sandrock Cosy Gameplay Sandrock Grinding Game Happen Extra Caves Resources Wait Ingots Smelt Tedious Story Improvement Portia Story Nice Couple Twist Incredible Surprise Series Townies Stories Compared Portia Entertaining Lots Hours Gameplay Replayable Games Romance Dialogues Sandrock Solid Gameplay Time 150 Hours Cons Sandrock Late Game Content Portia Sandrock Late Game Quest Sidequest Ignore Game Feels Days Major Personal Sidequests Townies Buggy Translation Quality Drops Hugely Late Game Bugged Care Development Central Game Late Game Previous Townies Town Dialogue Lines Resorting Generic Talks Befriendable Relations Townies Game Changer Townies Arc Main Quests Skipping Choice Lesser Arcs Left Relationship Rating Add Story Game Replayable Impact Game Based Handle Relationships Multiplayer Bitter Game Hoping Op Experience Wife Halfway Development Multiplayer Changed Sort Sandbox Experience Goal Steps Story Feels Boring Opinion Choice Stardew Valley Players Experience Original Story Simply Waste Resources Time Multiplayer Mode Satisfy Seek Op Multiplayer Sandrock Consideration,POSITIVE,1,0,76,10,0.8837209302325582
2023-11-04,"this is a general improvement of portia, with numerous qol improvements and better graphics.  if you want a chill builder sim game with a side of combat, this is a decent pick up.  that said there's a few things from the original that haven't improved:

-the combat is still too simplistic.  there are still no special attacks (the enemies get them, but not the player) so all you do for the most part is mash lmb and roll dodge once in a while.  there are ranged weapons, but having to constantly build more ammo is annoying so you'll just melee everything for the most part.
-the main story drags on way too long.  this was probably my main complaint about portia as well.  as another reviewer put it, there's an interesting major plotline where you fully expect the story to end afterwards but it drags on with more mundane busywork for another 10-15 hours.
-waiting on things.  you can speed up time to 3x speed at least without mods, but it can still take 15+ minutes of real time to smelt a stack of bars so a lot of the time you'll just toss stuff in and end the day to skip time.
-relation grind.  like the first game it is slow and tedious.  some characters aren't too bad because they constantly put up commissions which give a big chunk for something you want to do anyways, or are heavily involved in story missions.  others, like the doctor, require you go out of your way to talk to and constantly do boring crap like play critters (basically rock paper scissors with cards) over and over.  as a bonus middle finger, [spoiler]several characters leave partway through main story and get replaced by new ones[/spoiler].  hope you didn't waste your time on those ones!

2023-11-21,"a worthy, quality sequel. “my time at portia” was a decent game, but “my time at sandrock” takes nearly all the ideas to the next level, making it hard to go back to the previous game.

the game does a good job of combining lore and gameplay elements, which is quite unusual and pleasant for the genre. thanks to the fact that the player has a goal from the very beginning, and the set of actions is mostly based on how the world is structured, the game feels cohesive. for example, the ability to plant crops is not just given because it’s necessary, but due to certain plot events, and it’s given by an npc. the process of growing plants, although a bit tedious and requires excessive micromanagement, is still justified by the game world: water is scarce, the soil isn’t the best, so you have to put in the effort.

there’s a lot of content in the game, it unfolds quite slowly, but that’s not a downside, because there’s always something for the player to do. both the main quest and all the side quests may not be tarantino-level in terms of execution, but they’re adequately composed, always capable of keeping the game interesting.

the game has a few downsides:

[olist]
[*]clunky controls coupled with a rather primitive camera behavior. for example, you need to press a separate button for aiming, after which the camera sensitivity seems to increase due to the change in the camera’s anchor point.
[*]extremely sparse, quite primitive animation. it reveals the budget nature of the project and hinders immersion.
[*]an excess of invisible walls, especially in the local dungeons. it feels like the authors set up the walls after prototyping the levels, but forgot to put up boxes and other obstacles blocking the path in some places or placed them too far away.
[*]useless multiplayer. there is a cooperative mode in name, but it’s very primitive and boring. the authors chose an earlier time period of the city when it was under construction, were too lazy to attach a decent plot, and just allowed several players to mess around in it at the same time.

in comparison to something such as stardew valley (love!) i would say it's similar but different. sandrock isn't a farming sim for one - it's mostly focused on you being a builder. so it's a lot more on getting a workshop, crafting, setting up automation, etc. 
of course there is still animal rearing and farming that can be had! but it's not the primary focus. 

the world is still a great time, the characters in the city are fantastic (and voice acted often!) and a blast to go out on dates, have lunch with, or just say howdy in the town for. 

the combat is rather enjoyable as well! makes monster battling more enjoyable than many other games of this style. 

big tip i'd have: if you find the days going by too quick (or too slow), you can change the gameplay speed! i found at first a little overwhelmed as i was trying to do commissions each day & by the time i finished, i was running out of daylight! but then i just changed the gameplay speed (0.7 is my sweet spot i think) and it's just the perfect amount for me.

2023-11-09,"i liked ""my time at portia"" in spite of what it needed still in terms of polish. it was an ambitious game with many of the things it tried felt mostly half baked and not fully flushed out.

i can happily say that ""my time at sandrock"" not only meets the levels set up by it's predecessor, but also far exceeds them. 

first, the game proudly sticks with it's theme. every aspect of this is themed around you being in a desert, from basic crafting to even fishing. on a side note, this is easily the better fishing mini games i've played, but i wont spoil how that works.

second, the story is very engaging. ~50ish hours in, i'm very immersed in the setting and very motivated to keep going. the characters all seem to have their own motivations and there's a plethora of areas where their quests have pay off, both big and small. the small, being a mark of true craftsmanship.

third, the relationship mechanics are fantastic. they don't expand the bare bones from the previous game (if it ain't broke don't fix it) but there's more to do around sandrock than portia. i do have a favorite addition though [spoiler] you literally hold hands with your partner when you're out on a date, they'll keep up with you as you run. this is the cutest damn thing in the world. bless whomever pushed that to get in because it was worth it.[/spoiler] 

if you've played the sequel, than this should be a no brainer. if you've not played the series, if not, i'd probably recommend going with the previous game first, but don't let that stop you if you're eager to start. there's nothing in portia that's critical for sandrock to be enjoyable.

post completion update: 
i still mostly stick by what i said, albeit with a few things to call out. first, the dlc is already in the game, but they want you to pay to unlock it. it's also not fun to get an in-game ad for it, basically. dragon age did the same and i hated it then, and i hate it now.

second, there's didn't seem to be any reaction to the person i ended up marrying (ellie, in my case). cooper seems like he'd be all about spending time with his grand kids.

and the ending [spoiler] a little abrupt. it wasn't bad, but i'd prefer to end on a higher note.

2023-11-25,"this game started off so well, really seeming to be portia but better. but the more i play it, the more issues i'm having. i've got a lot of unconnected thoughts, so i'll list the good and bad then put a summary at the botom.

[b]good:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]oustanding character design, personality, and development.[/b]
seriously some of the most lovable npcs in gaming. everyone has a unique and very well developed personality, with their own backstories and character arc.
[*][b]interesting world with a great concept to base the game off of.[/b]
sandrock has a well thought out history, and you have the goal of showing up while it's getting run down and on the decline, and having to turn it around to make it prosper. you do this by building new things to make the town grow, by uncovering lost technology from the old world long destroyed by the day of the calamity, and by fighting off the growing desert.
[*][b]lots to do.[/b]
farm, build, grow your workshop, decorate, connect with the townspeople, play minigames, catch fish, explore ruins, fight monsters etc. you know what to expect from games like this, and this game manages to include a wide variety of content better than most.
[*][b]humour.[/b]
there's a lot of funny jokes, silliness, nice references, and all sorts that will make you smile.
[*][b]coziness.[/b]
the game is so damn pleasant. there's so many issues with it which i'll get to, but despite them all i still found myself having a great time up until towards the end. it's just such a nice world to be in, it's so lovely learning about all the characters and gradually improving the town and your own workshop. it's really nice.
[*][b]immersion.[/b]
bit of a weird one, but this is something this game does well i think. you can get so absorbed and lost in this world. i love games that have the ability to make me forget the real world and just live in this virtual one for a week or two. this game nailed that. the fact i have 130 hours played after only starting 12 days ago shows what i mean, lol.
[/list]


[b]bad:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]performance.[/b]
the game takes a solid 5-10 minutes to load. this is a constant issue. going from one place to another has a very long loading screen, and even when it finishes loading, very few entities have actually loaded. buildings, menus, npcs, and objects all take an extra minute or so to load. sometimes they just don't load at all, and you'll have to restart the game. i've never had so much issues with load times in a game.
[*][b]the game is extremely grindy and tedious.[/b]
i'm 130 hours in and not even made it halfway towards finishing some things. i'm not exaggerating. i'm still not even done with the story, and from what the achievements tell me, neither are 99% of the people playing the game. collecting resources is extremely repetitive and slow, so is crafting, so is befriending people, and fighting, and pretty much every aspect of the game. everything is painfully longwinded and drawn out, taking a ridiculously long time for little payoff.
[*][b]length.[/b]
i'm never one to complain about how long a game is, the more there is to do the happier i am. this game is the one exception to that. all the story points feel so disjointed. it could end at so many points, but it has to add a new twist or an entirely new and unrelated story every time, which adds an extra 30 hours to the game each time. why has the story gone from developing this town, to catching a bandit, to [spoilers]rescuing a rat princess, to fighting in a war[/spoilers]. it strays so so far from the starting point that it's hard to stay interested, and that brings me to my next point.
[*][b]story.[/b]
it starts off so good, but what on earth happened. at some point you need to stop and question if what you're doing makes sense, and this game just doesn't. the game throws plot twist after plot twist at you, without putting much thought into any of them. none of them make sense, none of them are good ideas, it just feels like it's elongating this already immensely long game for no actual benefit.
[*][b]quality.[/b]
the game is very janky, which i personally think is fine for the most part, but it's worth mentioning. combat has you zipping around erratically, you can walk up almost vertical walls, mounts controls awfully, camera movement during dialogue is very strange, every cutscene is broken if there's a sandstorm going on, sandstorms don't actually do anything, there are almost no quality of life features, lots of invisible walls, there's not much attention to detail, and many features of the game feel very barebones. there's a lot more i could mention but this is already too long. the game just feels very much like they set their ambitions higher than they're able to reach. the fact i've got myself softlocked twice, and just downloaded a week 2 update which fixes 90+ bugs says a lot about the game. it just isn't well made.
[*][b]multiplayer[/b]
when this game was announced, it was planned to have multiplayer. not long before the release of the game, they decided to change that, after already receiving backing and early access purchases from people who were promised the game would have multiplayer. the game now has the most barebones and pointless multiplayer you can ask for, with no story or any of what makes the game fun.
[/list]

to summarise, this game has so much potential. it's a lovely idea, with some elements like character development and world building done remarkably well. however, the poor quality of the game, slow detioration of the story, and incredibly monotonous gameplay results in a very mediocre overall experience.",11769,Game Started Portia Play Issues Lot Unconnected List Bad Summary Botom List Oustanding Character Design Personality Development Lovable Npcs Gaming Unique Developed Personality Backstories Character Arc Concept Base Game Sandrock History Goal Decline Prosper Building Town Grow Uncovering Lost Technology Destroyed Day Calamity Fighting Growing Desert Lots Farm Build Grow Workshop Decorate Connect Townspeople Play Minigames Catch Fish Explore Ruins Fight Monsters Expect Games Game Manages Include Wide Variety Content Humour Lot Funny Jokes Silliness Nice References Sorts Smile Coziness Game Damn Pleasant Issues Time Nice Lovely Learning Characters Gradually Improving Town Workshop Nice Immersion Bit Weird Game Absorbed Lost Love Games Ability Forget Real Live Virtual Week Game Nailed 130 Hours Played Starting 12 Days Lol List Bad List Performance Game Takes Solid 5 Minutes Load Constant Issue Loading Screen Finishes Loading Entities Loaded Buildings Menus Npcs Objects Extra Minute Load Load Restart Game Issues Load Times Game Game Extremely Grindy Tedious 130 Hours Halfway Finishing Exaggerating Story Achievements 99 People Playing Game Collecting Resources Extremely Repetitive Slow Crafting Befriending People Fighting Pretty Aspect Game Painfully Longwinded Drawn Ridiculously Time Payoff Complain Game Happier Game Exception Story Feel Disjointed Add Twist Unrelated Story Time Adds Extra 30 Hours Game Time Story Developing Town Catching Bandit Spoilers Rescuing Rat Princess Fighting War Spoilers Strays Starting Hard Stay Brings Story Starts Earth Happened Question Sense Game Game Throws Plot Twist Plot Twist Putting Sense Ideas Feels Elongating Immensely Game Actual Benefit Quality Game Janky Personally Fine Worth Mentioning Combat Zipping Erratically Walk Vertical Walls Mounts Controls Camera Movement Dialogue Strange Cutscene Broken Sandstorm Sandstorms Quality Life Features Lots Invisible Walls Attention Features Game Feel Barebones Lot Mention Game Feels Set Ambitions Reach Softlocked Downloaded Week 2 Update Fixes 90 Bugs Lot Game Multiplayer Game Announced Planned Multiplayer Release Game Decided Change Receiving Access Purchases People Promised Game Multiplayer Game Barebones Pointless Multiplayer Story Game Fun List Summarise Game Potential Lovely Idea Elements Character Development Building Remarkably Poor Quality Game Slow Detioration Story Incredibly Monotonous Gameplay Mediocre Experience,POSITIVE,1,0,82,9,0.9010989010989011
2023-11-24,"[h2]ahoy![/h2]

this be ye local piratical reviewer comin' to tell ye if my time at sandrock be worth your precious doubloons or whether she be sent down to the briny depths!

i want to tell ye first, i've played the predecessor my time at portia to completin' and will be makin' some comparisons between 'em, i'll also be splittin' me thoughts into ayes 'n nays for easy readin'

[h3]ayes[/h3]

[b]a real sense o' progression[/b]
my time at sandrock (mtas) nails that sense of progression that my time at portia (mtap) pioneered. as ye be making ye adventures, ye'll be changing sandrock, from buildin' cranes te' fixing the hydrogel, expanding the yakmel network to more serious ventures like plantin' forests in the desert and building the road to portia. 

for each quest chain ye complete, you'll get reminders just how far ye've came. making ye feel apart of the world, and ultimately it's my most favourite draw to mtas.

[b]craftin'[/b]
goin' hand in hand with makin' ye changes in sandrock, the crafting is an improvement upon mtap. ye have a bounty o' machines to be gettin' ye buildin. most days ye'll be havin' machines runnin' all day pumpin out manner o things for ye designs. ingots, screws, slabs, everything to be gettin' everythin' built. occasionally, you'll feel overwhelmed but honestly, i felt that it feed it the hectic job that is bein' a builder in mtas. ye'll eventually condense this into ye crown jewel near the end, the almighty factory.

[b]exploration[/b]
the world of sandrock is huge and thar be plenty to see and dive. you'll be prowlin' through dangerous ruins, fighting robots and mobs for parts ye need for your builds and ye'll be spendin' a fair chunk o' ye time in the abandoned ruins, bringin' up various ores and relics to both smelt and reassemble. i've got no complaints.

[b]the characters[/b]
in this pirates honest opinions, the characters in mtas shine far brighter then those in portia. every character has a small chain that details there daily lives and a insight to their personality. it added that depth to life and some reason to care about the characters compared to portia, the massively expanded amount of quests featured in mtas, really helped in this situation.

[h3]nays[/h3]

[b]combat[/b]
thar has been a' few changes to combat, however, it still be simplistic. you'll be finding yourself usin' the same strategies ye found in portia. ye'll be dodging the choreographed events, going in to break' em and then just devastating 'em. it's the same ole' song and dance. it be worse with guns, ye'll whip your pistol o' rifle and just stun lock and break your enemy in place, making short work out most o' everything. disappointin' really.

[b]performance[/b]
this be nay gay breakin' but ye'll certainly notice it in ye adventurin'. mtas doesn't play aswell as portia, ye have pop in galore, especially o' anything ye've added to the world via the quests. the game chugs in the town itself and has random slow downs in various places. it can detract from ye' experience.

the small positive is for me, is that the game has mostly been light on bugs and pathea has been on the ball since release. 

[b]dlc practices[/b]
i hated to be addin' this one but £4.49 for costumes for 4 characters and putting the favourites separate in individual packs is a practice that belongs in davey jones locker. either bundle them together for a tenner or reduce the price of the individuals. currently it looks a cash grab and add as a tarnish to this shining treasure.

[h3]conclusion n' scoring[/h3]
mtas is a large game and it's hard to condense everything inte' a few paragraphs. it's a massive improvement on mtap. if ye loved that game, ye'll be right at home here. a no brainer for ye doubloons.

if ye the kind of sailor that loves a solid sense o' progression with an in-depth crafting system, memorable characters and a massive chain of quests to go on and doesn't mind some minor annoyances and lacklustre combat system. ye'll definitely find some good sailing 'ere.

i give mtas a solid 8.5/10 gold doubloons. a massive improvement over portia if not marred by spotty performance and cheap dlc tactics.",9744,H2 Ahoy H2 Local Piratical Reviewer Comin Time Sandrock Worth Precious Doubloons Briny Depths Played Predecessor Time Portia Completin Makin Comparisons Em Splittin Ayes Nays Easy Readin H3 Ayes H3 Real Sense Progression Time Sandrock Mtas Nails Sense Progression Time Portia Mtap Pioneered Adventures Changing Sandrock Buildin Cranes Te Fixing Hydrogel Expanding Yakmel Network Ventures Plantin Forests Desert Building Road Portia Quest Chain Complete Reminders Feel Ultimately Favourite Draw Mtas Craftin Goin Hand Hand Makin Sandrock Crafting Improvement Mtap Bounty Machines Gettin Buildin Days Havin Machines Runnin Day Pumpin Manner Designs Ingots Screws Slabs Gettin Everythin Built Occasionally Feel Overwhelmed Honestly Feed Hectic Job Bein Builder Mtas Eventually Condense Crown Jewel Almighty Factory Exploration Sandrock Huge Thar Plenty Dive Prowlin Dangerous Ruins Fighting Robots Mobs Builds Spendin Fair Chunk Time Abandoned Ruins Bringin Ores Relics Smelt Reassemble Complaints Characters Pirates Honest Opinions Characters Mtas Shine Brighter Portia Character Chain Details Daily Lives Insight Personality Depth Life Reason Care Characters Compared Portia Massively Expanded Quests Featured Mtas Helped Situation H3 Nays H3 Combat Thar Combat Simplistic Finding Usin Strategies Portia Dodging Choreographed Events Break Em Devastating Em Ole Song Dance Worse Guns Whip Pistol Rifle Stun Lock Break Enemy Short Disappointin Performance Gay Breakin Notice Adventurin Mtas Play Aswell Portia Pop Galore Quests Game Chugs Town Random Slow Detract Experience Positive Game Light Bugs Pathea Ball Release Dlc Practices Hated Addin 4 49 Costumes 4 Characters Putting Favourites Separate Individual Packs Practice Belongs Davey Jones Locker Bundle Tenner Reduce Price Individuals Cash Grab Add Tarnish Shining Treasure H3 Conclusion Scoring H3 Mtas Game Hard Condense Inte Paragraphs Massive Improvement Mtap Loved Game Brainer Doubloons Sailor Loves Solid Sense Progression Depth Crafting Memorable Characters Massive Chain Quests Mind Minor Annoyances Lacklustre Combat Sailing Ere Mtas Solid 8 5 Gold Doubloons Massive Improvement Portia Marred Spotty Performance Cheap Dlc Tactics,POSITIVE,1,0,139,6,0.9586206896551724

2023-11-23,"one of my favorite games of all time. has the most complex social aspects i've seen in a game and what we usually all wanted for years with life sim games. other devs should take notes, honestly. 

the best part about this game: there is always plenty things to do, and they are all fun and useful, a lot of life sim games might have you build useless things. almost everything you build gets used in events, main story content, bridges to unlock new areas, oh, and there is always new places being unlocked as you progress, immersive atmosphere, new characters being introduced, and i mean years in-game. 408 hrs (continued from early access save) and i am still unlocking new characters, areas, story content.

all the characters are well voice and well written. and by well written---really, well written. i don't think i can play a harvest moon or story of seasons game after this tbh. it's spoiled me. the characters are fleshed out wonderfully, with their own thought out pasts, stories, you can talk about them in convo during play dates, or romantic ones. some characters have reverse confessions and characters have romance and friendship quests as well as multiple in story quests where other characters will talk and interact with you and eachother. i guarantee you will feel some emotion for every single one of these characters. characters i didn't like or care about before i got to know i grew to like later, their flaws and their traits both, and their stories. 

this is one of the most immersive games i've experienced. it makes you feel apart of the community, and the seratonin boosts you get just from speaking to villagers, getting gifts outside your house on your birthday or wedding day, having your partner ask if you'd like to spend the day together after marriage and take you on little dates when most games are like 'they are married, have kids' and it's either the end, or they are blank nobodies now that have no more content whatsoever! this game doesn't do that. 

if sandrock gets more content dlc or in the next my time game, if they decide to have a kid system, i'd rather no kids unless there is real content for them, this is what the people want pathea, even if you charge $ for it:

-family outings/content and story events with your child/partner, and with the townsfolk
-the child going to school/interacting with other children
-old enough to speak properly/help out around the work shop or be interested in another profession/maybe story content for the kid following qi or owen around if they wanted to work as a scientist apprentice/at the blue moon as a chef or waiter or something.  ((not neccessary, just would be super cute. i would just rather not have kids in a game, like how stardew did unless they have content, sandrock still beat the others for sure though.)) and maybe a better child system to know when your child needs something/bring them with you on a baby backpack or hire a babysitter if you can't be home.

i'm definitely doing another playthrough. it's easy to miss dialogue and content because there is so much((this is a good thing.)) we got so lucky with my time at sandrock and i feel like i would 100% die for any of the sandrockers fr. the story gets better and better. sometimes it's silly, sometimes it's serious, sometimes it's just fun. 

characters you befriend will someetimes show up outside your house because they miss you and want to hang out, and sometimes you will see a lot of ! events to unlock, where you can say to much is going on right now and get to it later.

you might walk into someones home and they are eating dinner together, arvios sister is visiting him, or the preacher is teaching jasmine how to speak politely if she didn't like an authors book. little details that bring life

oh, and don't get me started on the holidays. only game i cared about holidays. you have mini games on almost every one, from collecting ingredients on a yakmel and can bump into other people, grilling up food for the towns folk, a dance competition, and so much more.

on dates with friends and romantically, you can set off fireworks in a fun pattern of your choosing, draw in the sand, play whack a mole or games at the arcade, sit and talk on a bench or go out to eat and order them food. you can befriend folks easily without gift spamming. talking to them, being yourself and taking commissions/work on the request or commission board they asked for is helpful. some characters might need to unlock events to get there story or even be able to give gifts to them if they are more to themselves.

the personalities are well thought out. characters with pasts, multiple hobbies likes and dislikes, where most games the 'fisherman' is just a fisherman and nothing more, his entire personality. you will hear them talk about their family, their other interests, and things they like. the characters entire personality isnt just a trope or based around 1 thing. this is the best character development as well for some characters i've seen in a long time. i highly reccomend buying this. it will be a blast constantly.

usually life sims have moments when your bored. well 400 hrs in and still constant content. i'm just saying....i hope this becomes the new standard for life sims xd

2023-11-23,"i don't leave reviews often so let me explain why i am this time first then i'll talk about sandrock.  back in 2014 i bought pathea's (first?  think so?) game called planet explorers.  i loved it at first but it had such a long development then in 2016 they ""full released"" the game, all while i still encountered game breaking bugs in the first 10min of gameplay that i had when i first started the game in '14.  coming off of also getting burned on several other steam greenlight games (yall remember that s**t?!), i swore that i would never, ever, buy another pathea game again..... then in 2018 i saw this cute game pop up in my feed called my time at portia, i was immediately in love with the art style and premise of the game and bought immediately, somehow missing the pathea logos and name the entire time.  by the time i realized that they were made by the same devs i had like some 100+hrs in portia and exhausted all the content even available at the time.  i did become a bit doomer and just awaited it to just disappear into history as another abandoned game.... well i have 300+ hours in portia now and it ranks as one of my favorite games of all time.  so firstly, i want to thank pathea games for doing a complete flip in my book and coming out with absolute bangers that have lost me many hours in workshop (my real one not the one in game, that workshop gets overused!)

now, lets talk about sandrock specifically (no story spoilers dont worry).  i had no idea it was even coming until it was too late to even back it on kickstarted and i hated myself for it!  i mean look at sandrock!  it has everything i love portia and then just completely redid it or made it even better.  the art style is such a nice thing to look at, the animations feel so much more complete and the gameplay feels nice and balanced and gives you full freedom to play how you will with very little in the way of forcing progress except when you really want to.  don't wanna go ultra super heavy into making your workshop mega and just wanna socialize?  you got it!  or you can do what i do and take #1 builder before the first month is even over (suck it yan!). the characters are all so lovable or just absolutely memorable to me, pen is such a over the top dude, yan while being your main 'rival' doesn't like actively take commissions from you like higgins did (no more sprinting off to the guild to grab the good commissions before he does), and miguel as much as i don't like him like him i at least have an understanding of him and even at times sympathize with his views.  i was put off at first by how you get more resources from recyclers rather than just straight gather (which there is still plenty of!) but in time i grew to really enjoy that i could have all them crunching for copper while i go get iron.  everything about it feels so well thought and improved from portia while not feeling like they just ctrl+c ctrl+v.  while it does get tedious at first managing both water and fuel for machines it became second nature when i run over to machine to start new production to just auto fill with dregs and i rarely had an issue anymore of machine out of water/fuel(by the way never ever use your wood for fuel just go slap some powerstones or get some dregs, thank me later).  the greatest improvement imo is combat which feels leagues ahead of the combat i remember from portia and i actually like dungeon diving now (before it was more ugh ok i guess ill go...).  socializing also feels alot easier in this game, admittedly i tend to always put socializing on the back burner but in my now post release game everyone loves me.  the one thing i really complained about was it felt like i had not enough time to do everything i wanted because i had to run here or there to get things done but that got solved when i found the time slider, won't really help you crunch resources faster since those are timed to in game time, but it's easier to run home and start something to turn in a com without running out of time due to me spending time walking, i found that a .67 time setting to be a nice sweet spot for getting places without dragging a day too long.  

and on the story itself, again, no spoilers, but it's good, really good imo.  it kept me hooked and interested the whole way, and also laughing because this game doesn't try to make everything so serious even in the more serious parts of the game (there's always a punch line xd). i got so excited in the last major update before release that i couldn't help myself but again play all through the twist and turns of what i think is the climax of the game (haven't full played on release yet so idk if theres even more after that!) and even after completing it i didn't feel like i was done or satisfied, there was still more work to do, still more commissions to get and more to build and to get sandrock back to its former glory (and even better!).  before release, i had just shy of 300hrs in sandrock and in the past 2 weeks, even with my bloated work schedule these days ive blown 80hrs in my new playthough and i can definately see myself blowing another 300 on this game before i get 'tired' of it. 

the tldr of it is, yes, buy this game.  you'll love it, play how you want to play, don't get the biggest baddest workshop if you dont want to, dont socialize alot if you dont want to.  or do!  sit back, relax, take a load off your mind and just create and have fun or go full try hard and show that yan dude whose the real newbie.  and pathea, from the just in my opinion let down of planet explorers, you have my eternal gratitude for portia and sandrock and you have won me fully back and just eager for the day the next my time at x game comes out (highwind!? altara? i mean coooommmmee ooooonnnn!!!)

2023-11-23,"[h1]i liked it.[/h1]
i liked portia, and i liked this game. just finished it! lots to do, the story is much more significant than i expected. thumbs up.

...with caveats. i had hoped that this time around we'd be able to avoid some of the pitfalls that portia had, and there were exotic new pitfalls to enjoy as well.

[h2]spoilers ahead, sorry. skip to conclusion for non-spoilery assessment[/h2]

[h3]the good[/h3]
[list]
[*]unsuur
[*]lots of story content, more than portia
[*]you get to feel epic as the townies come to respect you
[*]the civil corps of sandrock acknowledges you as an honorary member instead of pretending for the entire game that they are stronger than you in spite of your combat prowess like the civil corps of portia did
[*]didn't rely pretty much at all on any of the old workshop machines from the old game, and new models where there was overlap
[*]had a much more effective environmental message, where portia kind of deliberately put you at odds with the environmentalists in the game while trying to talk about the importance of environmentalism
[*]some (some) of the voice acting was pretty good
[*]i liked the weapon variety and specialization you could do through knowledge points
[*]did a decent job of making it so you could stop hunting for older, low-level ore and minerals while still making you track down new ores and occasional rarities like engines and stuff.
[*]datable men in this game are way hotter than in portia. so are the women, but the glow-up award goes to the guys. much better fleshed out personalities across the board too.
[*]i really liked hanging out and dating being instant instead of scheduled for a specific time the next day.
[/list]

[h3]the bad[/h3]
[list]
[*]arvio
[*]nearly every model that's not a permanent feature of the landscape takes a long time to load in
[*]quite a bit of the voice acting and sound design is somewhere between questionable and bad
[*]pacing is often weird. see section below.
[*]dating and hanging out still isn't fun
[*]there is no contest whatsoever in the builder rankings. i beat yan in year one without trouble, and in year two mi-an didn't come close. i could have done just one commission a day and i still would have been miles ahead. i expected mi-an to surge ahead to at least claim some yan-level numbers once yan wasn't taking credit for all her work, but she just wasn't remotely a threat.
[*]there was not nearly enough variety in the commissions. never-ending metal ingots, metal plates, stone slabs, petrified wood planks and sticks, and canvas were my reward for climbing to five stars. why aren't people commissioning more, you know... built stuff?
[*]what the hell happened to the factory? in portia it had an awesome animated interior and dedicated upgrade options. in sandrock it's an ugly living room with all your machines crammed into it as cramped as you can manage. in portia it worked with the automated half of your assembly station, but in sandrock you wish you could just delete your assembly station entirely because you'll never use it again.
[*]i never once used a powerstone of either grade. i found it impossible to run out of dregs.
[*]i love merle, but i wanted a goat with rambo's horns.
[*]there's a whole upgrade in the abandoned ruins goggles to let you see the outline of the items you scan. only problem is every scannable item is smaller than the diamond indicator so you'll never actually see the outline of anything. portia had no such issue.
[*]sandrock fails in multiple instances to teach you about functions of the game. i never once learned to use a camera, so i had a whopping zero photos at the end of the game. i was made aware of the existence of parties thanks to the resources i had to make them go over well, but i only learned from the end credits that i was supposed to purchase and set up a banquet table to unlock this feature. i discovered that many of the datable npcs have outfit options in the social menu. i never found out how to make those happen. the fashion show seemed like the time for that to unlock, but the outfits were never made purchaseable, despite barber guy's enthusiasm about selling them in his dialogue. i thought maybe it was dlc, but it turns out it's not, so how was that meant to unlock? maybe after you marry them? nope. still no idea.
[*]i gave grace a custom pet name to call me when we got married. she just called me sugar instead.
[*]i am genuinely unsure if there are enough small items to donate to the museum to successfully fill the small item slots available
[*]the house builder interface is janky as hell. sometimes you just have to quit and go back in to get anything done as various items refuse to bring up their interaction options, become unmovable, become unresizable, or just plain disappear because of an errant click. was it a workshop machine? then don't bother checking your inventory or the ""workshop machine"" menu on the builder interface, because it's now in your mailbox. so better get your ass back home to get that item and then head back to the house builder thing to try and remember what you were doing.
[/list]

pacing issues
[list]
[*]i earned a greenhouse before i was ever able to develop a single tile of biocrust naturally, despite nonstop gardening starting the moment gardening was available. even without the greenhouse, the main story gifted me enough biocrust to make generating it manually a pointless feature.
[*]i was excited to get my max-level spear, but i earned the laser sword before i could make one and it was the indisputable optimal choice, rendering my knowledge points in spears worthless
[*]in portia the final build, a plane, blindsides you with a sudden need for truckloads of crystals you never thought to harvest before and makes you take in-game weeks just waiting for them to spawn so you can finish the quest. sandrock's elegant answer to this problem is to make the final build embarrassingly easy to complete. you'll probably have it finished in an afternoon with materials you had laying around. please, by all means, send me on a couple days of fetching to get the parts i need for this once-in-a-game build. they're never going to ask for another one, so make them unique items that i need to fight some boss monsters to obtain or something. i don't know, but ""a single expedition's worth of nanomaterial scrap and poplar wood and (checks notes) an item made a tiny amount of copper and bronze"" can't possibly be the best answer.
[*]in both portia and sandrock, the factory is a double-edged sword. it feels awesome to unlock godmode in your workshop, but you'll never have to think meaningfully about any commissions or build quests again. that's the day you go from bustling builder to rare material scavenger, and there's no going back, really. it was also too cheap and easy to have a factory in this game. couple grand, you're good to go. at least in portia you had to gather a mess of expensive materials and pony up the cash.
[*]you'll have the max-level workshop equipment by about the halfway point of the game. upgrading feels nice, so it's sad when this goes away so soon.
[/list]

[h3]conclusion[/h3]
this is a fundamentally fun game that, like its predecessor, is deeply flawed. it has heart, but it feels unfinished in a way i know they're not going to fix. i had hoped portia would serve as a learning experience that would lead to sandrock being far more optimized out the gate. instead, it's genuinely unclear if they learned much of anything from portia's issues.

would i buy a new entry in this series in the future? well... probably. because they did at least prove they have some fun new ideas that do iterate successfully on the ""my time at"" formula. but at this point pathea is cementing itself in my head as a studio with a lot of muscle in the ideas department, but anemic in the polish department. the public is growing weary of studios that can't release a finished game.",9123,H1 H1 Portia Game Finished Lots Story Expected Thumbs Caveats Hoped Time Avoid Pitfalls Portia Exotic Pitfalls Enjoy H2 Spoilers Skip Conclusion Spoilery Assessment H2 H3 H3 List Unsuur Lots Story Content Portia Feel Epic Townies Respect Civil Corps Sandrock Acknowledges Honorary Pretending Entire Game Stronger Spite Combat Prowess Civil Corps Portia Rely Pretty Workshop Machines Game Models Overlap Effective Environmental Message Portia Deliberately Odds Environmentalists Game Talk Environmentalism Voice Acting Pretty Weapon Variety Specialization Knowledge Decent Job Hunting Level Ore Minerals Track Ores Occasional Rarities Engines Stuff Datable Game Hotter Portia Women Glow Award Guys Fleshed Personalities Board Hanging Dating Instant Scheduled Specific Time Day List H3 Bad H3 List Arvio Model Permanent Feature Landscape Takes Time Load Bit Voice Acting Sound Design Questionable Bad Pacing Weird Dating Hanging Fun Contest Whatsoever Builder Rankings Beat Yan Trouble Mi Close Commission Day Miles Expected Mi Surge Claim Yan Level Yan Credit Remotely Threat Variety Commissions Metal Ingots Metal Plates Stone Slabs Petrified Wood Planks Sticks Canvas Reward Climbing Stars People Commissioning Built Stuff Happened Factory Portia Awesome Animated Interior Dedicated Upgrade Options Sandrock Ugly Living Machines Crammed Cramped Manage Portia Automated Assembly Station Sandrock Delete Assembly Station Powerstone Grade Impossible Dregs Love Merle Goat Rambo Horns Upgrade Abandoned Ruins Goggles Outline Items Scan Scannable Item Diamond Indicator Outline Portia Issue Sandrock Fails Multiple Instances Teach Functions Game Learned Camera Whopping Photos Game Aware Existence Parties Resources Learned Credits Supposed Purchase Set Banquet Table Unlock Feature Discovered Datable Npcs Outfit Options Social Menu Happen Fashion Time Unlock Outfits Purchaseable Barber Guy Enthusiasm Selling Dialogue Dlc Meant Unlock Marry Nope Idea Grace Custom Pet Married Called Sugar Genuinely Unsure Items Donate Museum Item Slots House Builder Interface Janky Quit Items Refuse Bring Interaction Options Unmovable Unresizable Plain Disappear Errant Workshop Machine Bother Checking Inventory Workshop Machine Menu Builder Interface Mailbox Ass Item Head House Builder Remember List Pacing Issues List Earned Greenhouse Develop Single Tile Biocrust Naturally Nonstop Gardening Starting Moment Gardening Greenhouse Main Story Gifted Biocrust Generating Manually Pointless Feature Excited Max Level Spear Earned Laser Sword Indisputable Optimal Choice Rendering Knowledge Spears Worthless Portia Final Build Plane Blindsides Sudden Truckloads Crystals Harvest Game Weeks Waiting Spawn Finish Quest Sandrock Elegant Answer Final Build Embarrassingly Easy Complete Finished Afternoon Materials Laying Send Couple Days Fetching Game Build Unique Items Fight Boss Monsters Single Expedition Worth Nanomaterial Scrap Poplar Wood Checks Notes Item Tiny Copper Bronze Answer Portia Sandrock Factory Double Edged Sword Feels Awesome Unlock Godmode Workshop Meaningfully Commissions Build Quests Day Bustling Builder Rare Material Scavenger Cheap Easy Factory Game Couple Grand Portia Gather Mess Expensive Materials Pony Cash Max Level Workshop Equipment Halfway Game Upgrading Feels Nice Sad List H3 Conclusion H3 Fundamentally Fun Game Predecessor Deeply Flawed Heart Feels Unfinished Hoped Portia Serve Learning Experience Lead Sandrock Optimized Gate Genuinely Unclear Learned Portia Issues Entry Series Future Prove Fun Ideas Iterate Time Formula Pathea Cementing Head Studio Lot Muscle Ideas Department Anemic Polish Department Public Growing Weary Studios Release Finished Game,POSITIVE,1,0,147,16,0.901840490797546

2023-11-22,"mtas is, from the get-go, very similar to its predecessor my time at portia and for the most part that holds true as this was supposed to be an expansion before turning into a separate project.

does it separate itself enough to warrant a separate purchase? i believe so, although i believe the price increased since early access when i purchased it.

initially i was put off by the chosen setting as having a farming game be set in a desolate desert setting seemed like a tall order but the developers managed to introduce new mechanics to account for this without removing one of the core parts of the original game. i will not go into detail as some of these mechanics are also tied to the story which is appreciated as well. they may seem a bit tedious at the beginning but eventually as with the previous games most of the energy/water requirements become trivial from simply farming out other resources which i find to be nice as the game is already pretty grindy as its predecessor was in some aspects. a quick tip: do try to get a pet asap as they help a ton.
how grindy the game feels however depends on what you as the player would like to do and how stressed you feel about worker of the month/year nominations. if you want to keep ahead you will be farming 3-4 commissions daily as well as blowing all your stamina in abandoned ruins which can become a bit of a repetitive chore (for me this feeling started somewhere around winter 1st year). in order to avoid this i would recommend engaging with other parts of the game as well (hangouts/romance/building the house/farm) and not feeling like you need to squeeze out every ounce of stamina out of every day otherwise you will burn out quickly.

in terms of the story i still have not reached the complete conclusion but i believe nobody expected this game to bring out a game of the year contender in this regard.
if there is one thing however i would say that the pacing feels off for me. lot of the progression is gated by arbitrary amounts of days that have to pass in order for you to even receive an email that will tell you (at the beginning of a given day) that the story will continue 2 days from now. after those 2 days pass you usually go to a fireside meeting where they will say something usually followed by another day or 2 of waiting which became a real point of frustration as i already blew through all the mining/building content and needed story to progress to access the 3rd abandoned ruins which never seem to come. at this point i am in year 2 spring and i have been done with all that 2nd abandoned ruins offer in year 1 day 26 autumn which means i spent most of winter just running around hoping a side-quest would appear or the story would hurry up and come but it never did as from what i read i am still a few mysterious letters off from actually getting to the ruins. feels like i am being drip fed story at this point which would be fine if i was not done with everything i can do in a given day at about 3pm with plenty of time to spare.

hangouts/romance are pretty similar to what they were in portia but i appreciate the variety of characters that are available although i do miss papa bear. i thought sandy was going to be a nice replacement for papa bear for me but the sound that camel makes evoke some primordial feelings of horror in me so i avoid her usually.
one thing that i find odd is how easy it is to become a bff with heidi specifically since many of the commissions are from her so even if i do not really care about her she is my best friend stat-wise since avoiding her commissions would be hamstringing my progress too much. of course with addition of a bounty board this levels out a bit as those requests (at least in my experience) came from a variety of characters usually not requesting standard commissions like elsie for example who in my play-through appeared on standard commission board maybe twice with a incredibly simple request that yields almost no rewards.

all in all it might seem like i am airing my grievances with the game which is true but i still really like it for what it is. it may not be perfect owing to the points above or the bugs which still plague it but i do believe it is a great experience for people who liked the first game and builds upon it well. the grind feels satisfying when done in moderation and there are a lot of options for customizing your yard and house. romance options are plenty and compared to the first game there seem to be more post-marriage content.
i do hope future brings more bugfixes and even content if we should be so lucky.

p.s.
if a sequel ever comes i do hope for a different environment though as portia was also 1/3 if not 1/2 desert which i understand is a rather major plot point in the overall story but i am kind of over sand now, thanks.",9290,Mtas Predecessor Time Portia Holds True Supposed Expansion Separate Project Separate Warrant Separate Purchase Price Increased Access Purchased Initially Chosen Setting Farming Game Set Desolate Desert Setting Tall Developers Managed Introduce Mechanics Account Removing Core Original Game Mechanics Tied Story Appreciated Bit Tedious Eventually Previous Games Energy Water Requirements Trivial Simply Farming Resources Nice Game Pretty Grindy Predecessor Aspects Quick Pet Asap Ton Grindy Game Feels Depends Player Stressed Feel Worker Month Nominations Farming 3 4 Commissions Daily Blowing Stamina Abandoned Ruins Bit Repetitive Chore Feeling Started Winter 1St Avoid Recommend Engaging Game Hangouts Romance Building House Farm Feeling Squeeze Ounce Stamina Day Burn Terms Story Reached Complete Conclusion Expected Game Bring Game Contender Regard Pacing Feels Lot Progression Gated Arbitrary Amounts Days Pass Receive Email Day Story Continue 2 Days 2 Days Pass Fireside Meeting Day 2 Waiting Real Frustration Blew Mining Building Content Story Progress Access 3Rd Abandoned Ruins 2 Spring 2Nd Abandoned Ruins Offer 1 Day 26 Autumn Spent Winter Running Hoping Quest Story Hurry Read Mysterious Letters Ruins Feels Drip Fed Story Fine Day 3Pm Plenty Time Spare Hangouts Romance Pretty Portia Variety Characters Papa Bear Sandy Nice Replacement Papa Bear Sound Camel Evoke Primordial Feelings Horror Avoid Odd Easy Bff Heidi Commissions Care Friend Stat Wise Avoiding Commissions Hamstringing Progress Addition Bounty Board Levels Bit Requests Experience Variety Characters Requesting Standard Commissions Elsie Play Appeared Standard Commission Board Incredibly Simple Request Yields Rewards Airing Grievances Game True Perfect Bugs Plague Experience People Game Builds Grind Feels Satisfying Moderation Lot Options Customizing Yard House Romance Options Plenty Compared Game Post Marriage Content Hope Future Brings Bugfixes Content Lucky Sequel Hope Environment Portia 1 3 1 2 Desert Understand Major Plot Story Sand,POSITIVE,1,0,247,20,0.9250936329588015

2023-11-26,"if you liked my time at portia, skip the review and buy the game, it's an overall improvement to his predecessor!

if you like ""stardew valley"" like games, this can be an interesting title for you!

[b]what is my time at sandrock?[/b]
sandrock is a ""you come into a run down town to take over a run down activity to improve yourself and the city"" genre (stardew valley, coral island, portia, harvest moon, etc..) but here you are not a farmer, you are a builder in a post apocalyptic (but cute-ish) world.

you will have to gather resources, build stuff, take main quests as well as commisions, with time and gifts you will slowly win the hearth of the sandrockers, unlocking their personal stories while unfolding the story of sandrock.

[b]what are the pros of sandrock?[/b]
- [i]cosy gameplay:[/i] sandrock isn't much of a grinding game, yes it may happen that you will need an extra run into the caves to get the resources you need and sometimes you will have to wait for some ingots to smelt but it's not tedious or really long.
- [i]good story:[/i] this is the big improvement from portia, the story is nice and has a couple of twist, nothing incredible but also a welcome surprise for this series. townies have some better stories as well (compared to portia) and seem more entertaining.
- [i]lots of hours of gameplay:[/i] despite it's not the most replayable of games (if not for seeing how the different romance changes some dialogues), sandrock has a solid gameplay time, around 150 hours more or less

[b]what are the cons of sandrock?[/b]
- [i]late game content:[/i] like portia, sandrock has a problem with the late/end game part, even if some quest and sidequest, i can't ignore the fact that the last part of the game feels too empty (various days without anything major to do and no more personal sidequests from townies), buggy (translation quality drops hugely in late game as well as some bugged parts, showing more care in the development of the first and central part of the game rather than the late game) and overall less interesting than the previous parts. also the last townies that join the town don't have much dialogue lines (often resorting on generic talks) and aren't befriendable.
- [i]relations with townies are not a game changer:[/i] townies that have an important arc are added to the main quests (so there is no skipping or choice on them) while lesser arcs are left to the relationship rating but really don't add anything to the story. this makes the game not really replayable as there is no much impact on the game based on how you handle the relationships.
- [i]multiplayer:[/i] this is a bitter part for me, i backed the game hoping in a full co-op experience with my wife but halfway into the development the multiplayer was changed into a sort of sandbox experience with several goal steps and almost no story. it feels empty and boring in my opinion, the best choice would have been either make a stardew-valley like mp where players can experience the original story or simply not waste resources and time on it. an half-backed multiplayer mode will not satisfy anybody, if you seek a good co-op multiplayer, do not take sandrock into consideration",9102,Time Portia Skip Review Game Improvement Predecessor Stardew Valley Games Title Time Sandrock Sandrock Town Activity Improve City Genre Stardew Valley Coral Island Portia Harvest Moon Farmer Builder Post Apocalyptic Cute Ish Gather Resources Build Stuff Main Quests Commisions Time Gifts Slowly Win Hearth Sandrockers Unlocking Personal Stories Unfolding Story Sandrock Pros Sandrock Cosy Gameplay Sandrock Grinding Game Happen Extra Caves Resources Wait Ingots Smelt Tedious Story Improvement Portia Story Nice Couple Twist Incredible Surprise Series Townies Stories Compared Portia Entertaining Lots Hours Gameplay Replayable Games Romance Dialogues Sandrock Solid Gameplay Time 150 Hours Cons Sandrock Late Game Content Portia Sandrock Late Game Quest Sidequest Ignore Game Feels Days Major Personal Sidequests Townies Buggy Translation Quality Drops Hugely Late Game Bugged Care Development Central Game Late Game Previous Townies Town Dialogue Lines Resorting Generic Talks Befriendable Relations Townies Game Changer Townies Arc Main Quests Skipping Choice Lesser Arcs Left Relationship Rating Add Story Game Replayable Impact Game Based Handle Relationships Multiplayer Bitter Game Hoping Op Experience Wife Halfway Development Multiplayer Changed Sort Sandbox Experience Goal Steps Story Feels Boring Opinion Choice Stardew Valley Players Experience Original Story Simply Waste Resources Time Multiplayer Mode Satisfy Seek Op Multiplayer Sandrock Consideration,POSITIVE,1,0,76,10,0.8837209302325582
2023-11-21,"a worthy, quality sequel. “my time at portia” was a decent game, but “my time at sandrock” takes nearly all the ideas to the next level, making it hard to go back to the previous game.

the game does a good job of combining lore and gameplay elements, which is quite unusual and pleasant for the genre. thanks to the fact that the player has a goal from the very beginning, and the set of actions is mostly based on how the world is structured, the game feels cohesive. for example, the ability to plant crops is not just given because it’s necessary, but due to certain plot events, and it’s given by an npc. the process of growing plants, although a bit tedious and requires excessive micromanagement, is still justified by the game world: water is scarce, the soil isn’t the best, so you have to put in the effort.

there’s a lot of content in the game, it unfolds quite slowly, but that’s not a downside, because there’s always something for the player to do. both the main quest and all the side quests may not be tarantino-level in terms of execution, but they’re adequately composed, always capable of keeping the game interesting.

the game has a few downsides:

[olist]
[*]clunky controls coupled with a rather primitive camera behavior. for example, you need to press a separate button for aiming, after which the camera sensitivity seems to increase due to the change in the camera’s anchor point.
[*]extremely sparse, quite primitive animation. it reveals the budget nature of the project and hinders immersion.
[*]an excess of invisible walls, especially in the local dungeons. it feels like the authors set up the walls after prototyping the levels, but forgot to put up boxes and other obstacles blocking the path in some places or placed them too far away.
[*]useless multiplayer. there is a cooperative mode in name, but it’s very primitive and boring. the authors chose an earlier time period of the city when it was under construction, were too lazy to attach a decent plot, and just allowed several players to mess around in it at the same time.

2023-11-21,"[i]my time at portia[/i] was a real surprise for me when i first played it. i'm pretty sure i got it in a bundle. it looked like someone had repurposed the assets of a korean mmo from 2010. but it turned out to be an unexpectedly feature rich game with an interesting post-apocalyptic worldbuilding, gameplay with genuinely novel ideas in combining the day-to-day work cycle and socializing of [i]harvest moon[/i] with softer factory game mechanics and combat, and just a good amount of content that was fun despite the jank.

[i]my time at sandrock[/i] takes all the good ideas of its predecessor which felt accidentally good at many times, and elevates them so you can make no mistake that pathea are actually a really talented and hardworking company that knows what they're doing. is it free of jank? no, not really. but it's so chockful of good things that even the jank becomes charming. it has a great, interesting story full of characters with vibrant personalities and not the paper-thin cutouts you get in [i]stardew valley[/i]. the world of the setting is so fully realized despite the series' cartoony nature and you feel excited to explore and learn about it. it is genuinely laugh out loud funny at many points, and genuinely emotional at others. i have to give it up for the vas who don't seem like professionals but are still giving their best. the building gameplay while its core loop is the same, sees a lot of qol improvements. the combat is more dynamic and offers a bit of challenge though it's still on the casual side. there's so many small charming details too, like when you go on dates in-game, they put in an animation where your significant other holds your hand. they didn't have to do that. it has no mechanical value. it's just cute and it makes you feel good.

stuff like that is why i think most of all, what the game nails is that it makes it good to be in sandrock, and to see sandrock grow. everyone who plays games for long enough understands the feeling where a place in a game becomes like a real place we have visited and been in, and we feel a sort of nostalgia seeing it. i think sandrock will feel that way to many people playing the game, it's such a wonderfully crafted setting, and it really fulfills the promise of the genre of ""life sim"" where you can take a break from reality and live somewhere else for a little while. i'm not even done with the main story. i restarted with 1.0 to experience it as intended since in beta lots of the quests squished together in buggy ways as they were implemented, but i feel glad to have done that. this is gonna be a game i will have good memories of and consider a favorite years from now.

2023-11-09,"this is a tremendously satisfying game about harvesting materials, crafting, completing tasks, and helping a town prosper.  it's easy to see just a few hours in just how much thought has gone into the systems.  there's plenty to do to fill a day, and new main and side quests pop up on the regular to keep you moving forward.  the game respects your time with convenient tooltips, tutorials, and things like paying to expand your bags directly from your inventory, or being able to complete objectives with materials in your storage.

the social aspect of the game is also surprisingly strong.  the characters are often interesting and the writing is genuinely funny.  there's an interplay of story and gameplay as certain events will cause prices of goods to fluctuate or prompt a community response.  there are mini-activities to do with townsfolk to increase affinity and neat holidays.  there's also lore bits here and there that i did not expect to be as poignant as they are. 

there is combat, and it is fine, but i do not think that is the main draw.  my only complaints would be nitpicks.  the random character customization produces some nightmarish results, and the house expansion system is somewhat fiddly.  

this is a strong recommend.

2023-11-18,"this game is amazing, beautiful and full of content.
something from me:
 if you haven't played my time at portia, no worries because game gives a lot of tutorials for old and new/redesigned mechanics. in my opinion it's worth to buy even though it's pretty expensive. i think it's even more understandable game than portia, but there is still one basic problem. it's about portia and sandrock, that both games can get bored with some time, and it's just important to make breaks for other games too, since when you decide to stop playing it, it's hard to come back (because of amount of stuff and mechanics you might forgot in that time). 

advantages + :
- game is very addictive
- story is very interesting
- graphic design and landscapes are not that perfect, but it's a lot better in comparision with my time at portia
- in general designs have changed, like customization, better quality textures
- omg you can literally buy horse and stable. and it's not about horses only, there are other animals you can ride too like camel
- concept with sandstorms and sandwall in your workshop is amazing
- game is just more clear than my time at portia when it comes to produice something in comparision to portia
- event quests in game are very cool
- i'm willing to play that with my best buddy in coop because game finally have that option! :))
disadvantages:
- i found some bugs, for instance character i was talking with suddenly jumped into sky and started to fall down, but game is still playable (at least for me)
and honetly i don't see any other disadvantages, i just fell in love with this game :>
so if you wonder if you should play it, ofc you shoould.

also small tip for beginners: don't take unknown commision from board because you might realize in the end that you can't produce that thing and need special machine, but to get that machine you have to wait from 2 to even 6 or 7 days in research station, and your commision might have like 2-3 days left to finish it (naaah totally not my experience)",13431,Game Amazing Beautiful Content Played Time Portia Worries Game Lot Tutorials Redesigned Mechanics Opinion Worth Pretty Expensive Understandable Game Portia Basic Portia Sandrock Games Bored Time Breaks Games Decide Playing Hard Stuff Mechanics Forgot Time Advantages Game Addictive Story Graphic Design Landscapes Perfect Lot Comparision Time Portia Designs Changed Customization Quality Textures Omg Literally Horse Stable Horses Animals Ride Camel Concept Sandstorms Sandwall Workshop Amazing Game Time Portia Produice Comparision Portia Event Quests Game Cool Play Buddy Coop Game Finally Option Disadvantages Bugs Instance Character Talking Suddenly Jumped Sky Started Fall Game Playable Honetly Disadvantages Fell Love Game Play Ofc Shoould Beginners Unknown Commision Board Realize Produce Special Machine Machine Wait 2 6 7 Days Station Commision 2 3 Days Left Finish Naaah Totally Experience,POSITIVE,1,0,32,6,0.8421052631578947
2023-11-09,"i liked ""my time at portia"" in spite of what it needed still in terms of polish. it was an ambitious game with many of the things it tried felt mostly half baked and not fully flushed out.

i can happily say that ""my time at sandrock"" not only meets the levels set up by it's predecessor, but also far exceeds them. 

first, the game proudly sticks with it's theme. every aspect of this is themed around you being in a desert, from basic crafting to even fishing. on a side note, this is easily the better fishing mini games i've played, but i wont spoil how that works.

second, the story is very engaging. ~50ish hours in, i'm very immersed in the setting and very motivated to keep going. the characters all seem to have their own motivations and there's a plethora of areas where their quests have pay off, both big and small. the small, being a mark of true craftsmanship.

third, the relationship mechanics are fantastic. they don't expand the bare bones from the previous game (if it ain't broke don't fix it) but there's more to do around sandrock than portia. i do have a favorite addition though [spoiler] you literally hold hands with your partner when you're out on a date, they'll keep up with you as you run. this is the cutest damn thing in the world. bless whomever pushed that to get in because it was worth it.[/spoiler] 

if you've played the sequel, than this should be a no brainer. if you've not played the series, if not, i'd probably recommend going with the previous game first, but don't let that stop you if you're eager to start. there's nothing in portia that's critical for sandrock to be enjoyable.

post completion update: 
i still mostly stick by what i said, albeit with a few things to call out. first, the dlc is already in the game, but they want you to pay to unlock it. it's also not fun to get an in-game ad for it, basically. dragon age did the same and i hated it then, and i hate it now.

second, there's didn't seem to be any reaction to the person i ended up marrying (ellie, in my case). cooper seems like he'd be all about spending time with his grand kids.

and the ending [spoiler] a little abrupt. it wasn't bad, but i'd prefer to end on a higher note.

2023-11-01,"i talked to a phone booth in the game that told me to leave a review with feedback, so i'm gonna do that!

this game's totally worth the asking price as-is, really elevates the farm life genre beyond stardew valley in pretty much every way (i loved stardew!), and offers a scintillating post-apocalyptic desert setting that feels really novel.

this game clearly has a lot to say about the way capital and a self-serving government can funnel money to prop up those who are already successful whilst leaving struggling communities to languish. there are tons of quests and side quests where characters ask if you can spot them money because the economy in sandrock is awful, and public servants will frequently lament the difficulty the town has getting government grants and the belief the residents should 'just move somewhere nicer' without regard for the town's unique culture or the financial hurdles one must jump over to be able to afford moving.

i'm still not done with the game's main story line even 80 hours in, but i'm excited to see how it further develops arguments between characters about the potential perils of technological advancement, because it seems like the game's religious faction is on the verge of lashing out at sandrock's local government for making use of scientific advancements to try and make the desert environment more habitable.

the game's premise also allows it to offer critique on world politics and modern society from the perspective of characters who are discovering information about us hundreds of years in the future. in the 'my time at' series' lore, to really simplify it, technology progressed with little oversight or regulation which made it trivially easy to start a world war that decimated most (all?) of the planet's surface and plunged the world into a new dark age, with people living underground until they were able to return to the surface and rebuild on top of the ruins.

i was surprised by the way this game tackles criticisms of the genre as being centered on mindless extractivism; the rationing of water from the local supply is a serious gameplay factory to account for, the logistical challenges of importing water from other towns is discussed frequently, and you're told as soon as you start the game that logging is illegal due to how few trees there are. plus there's a serious focus on scavenging for scraps and re-purposing those into materials.

this game really surprised me; i had kind of written it off because i thought the art style was a touch off-putting, but the narrative, character writing, and gameplay loops have all charmed and hooked me.

now, because that phone booth said the developers read reviews of the game for feedback, here's some very specific complaints i'd like addressed:

1. i'm in the summer of year two, partway through the bronco the kid quests, and i keep getting building commissions for items i cannot complete because i haven't met musa yet, which means i haven't gained access to the areas that unlock when he shows up in town. some of the commissions i've seen posted but can't complete are industrial machine tools, the advanced civil processor, and chromium daggers. i have these recipes already because i've been diligent about doing machine research with qi and buying recipes from the commerce guild, but i think the game should check to see whether the player has the ability to get the materials necessary to make something before it pops up as a commission.

2. after you first get the chance to express romantic interest in elsie, there's a line of dialogue where she declares 'i'm a legal adult' in frustration at the way her parents treat her. i appreciate the effort to make it clear she's not too young to ethically date, but she's very childish, and that line just makes her sound more childish. the mention of legality feels like a reassurance to the player, which doesn't make for good character dialog.

3. at some point, jumping with my camel started causing the game to freeze in the air for a half-second, after which it hits the ground and all four hoof-hitting-ground sounds play one right after the other. i swear the jumping animation used to be way smoother without that hitch and without the weird sound; i don't have performance issues in this game, so it's not lag as far as i can tell.

4. sometimes machines will get stuck saying they need to have the sand cleaned out of them, and no matter how many different positions or angles i try i cannot see a sand pile to remove with my duster. i found that picking the machine up and putting it back down fixes it temporarily, but i would prefer to just not have that issue, it's annoying having to finesse the position of a civil furnace that sits between two other furnaces.

5. i need storage to be sortable across all boxes instead of the 'sort' option just sorting that individual storage box, as well as the ability to search for an item in storage by name. i would also like for storage to always be accessible when you're gifting a character something. it's frustrating going through my 10? 12? large storage boxes, each with two pages of items to scroll through, especially since item names are only visible by using the left stick and going over every item.

6. finding relic parts for qi's side quests is too time consuming. i would prefer the quest-necessary relic pieces be located in chests in the ruins rather than in the dirt; i haven't found the scanner particularly effective at locating the quest pieces, so i've just been hitting every piece of dirt i can find on every floor hoping to uncover a relic piece eventually, which is extremely tedious when i also really need to move on to a new floor for the ores so i have the materials to complete my commissions.

7. the lack of tin scrap makes bronze more difficult to craft than stuff like chromium or manganese steel, and i'm not sure why that's the case given bronze is required for crafting so many different things.

8. there should be an option to turn on alerts for commissions that are going to expire that day. even if you're tracking your commissions that are due the soonest, you won't see when the commission expires on the main screen.

9. the shop interface should tell you whether clothing/accessories are better or worse than your current gear; i can't really compare my gear when it's all named something like 'stunt rider desert warrior visor' or 'bright defense team boots' since those names don't convey anything about their stats. it's also a struggle to remember my shirt provides, for example, '+136 health + 17 stamina +5% critical hit chance + negates poison status effects' when i'm in a shop going through a bunch of different shirts all with different stat buffs and effects.

10. add a setting that lets run be set as the default movement speed, please. using the 'toggle' doesn't work because there a bunch of annoying circumstances where the game toggles the player back to walking.

11. it's pretty easy to get stuck on obstacles in the sandrunning competition, and i lost a race because i got stuck under a boost pad ramp after hitting it from the side and had to forfeit to get out.

all of that said though, it's a great game, i'm looking forward to getting through the main story so i can go try my time at portia after this!",2157,Talked Phone Booth Game Told Leave Review Feedback Gonna Game Totally Worth Price Elevates Farm Life Genre Stardew Valley Pretty Loved Stardew Offers Scintillating Post Apocalyptic Desert Setting Feels Game Lot Capital Serving Government Funnel Money Prop Successful Leaving Struggling Communities Languish Tons Quests Quests Characters Spot Money Economy Sandrock Awful Public Servants Frequently Lament Difficulty Town Government Grants Belief Residents Nicer Regard Town Unique Culture Financial Hurdles Jump Afford Moving Game Main Story 80 Hours Excited Develops Arguments Characters Potential Perils Technological Advancement Game Religious Faction Verge Lashing Sandrock Local Government Scientific Advancements Desert Environment Habitable Game Premise Offer Critique Politics Modern Society Perspective Characters Discovering Hundreds Future Time Series Lore Simplify Technology Progressed Oversight Regulation Trivially Easy Start War Decimated Planet Surface Plunged Dark Age People Living Underground Return Surface Rebuild Ruins Surprised Game Tackles Criticisms Genre Centered Mindless Extractivism Rationing Water Local Supply Gameplay Factory Account Logistical Challenges Importing Water Towns Discussed Frequently Told Start Game Logging Illegal Trees Focus Scavenging Scraps Purposing Materials Game Surprised Written Art Style Touch Putting Narrative Character Writing Gameplay Loops Charmed Hooked Phone Booth Developers Read Reviews Game Feedback Specific Complaints Addressed 1 Summer Partway Bronco Kid Quests Building Commissions Items Complete Met Musa Gained Access Unlock Town Commissions Posted Complete Industrial Machine Tools Advanced Civil Processor Chromium Daggers Recipes Diligent Machine Qi Buying Recipes Commerce Guild Game Check Player Ability Materials Pops Commission 2 Chance Express Romantic Elsie Dialogue Declares Legal Adult Frustration Parents Treat Effort Ethically Childish Sound Childish Mention Legality Feels Reassurance Player Character Dialog 3 Jumping Camel Started Causing Game Freeze Air Hits Ground Hoof Hitting Ground Sounds Play Swear Jumping Animation Smoother Hitch Weird Sound Performance Issues Game Lag 4 Machines Stuck Sand Cleaned Matter Positions Angles Sand Pile Remove Duster Picking Machine Putting Fixes Temporarily Prefer Issue Annoying Finesse Position Civil Furnace Sits Furnaces 5 Storage Sortable Boxes Sort Option Sorting Individual Storage Box Ability Search Item Storage Storage Accessible Gifting Character Frustrating 12 Storage Boxes Items Scroll Item Names Visible Left Stick Item 6 Finding Relic Qi Quests Time Consuming Prefer Quest Relic Pieces Located Chests Ruins Dirt Scanner Effective Locating Quest Pieces Hitting Piece Dirt Floor Hoping Uncover Relic Piece Eventually Extremely Tedious Floor Ores Materials Complete Commissions 7 Lack Tin Scrap Bronze Difficult Craft Stuff Chromium Manganese Steel Bronze Required Crafting 8 Option Alerts Commissions Expire Day Tracking Commissions Soonest Commission Expires Main Screen 9 Shop Interface Clothing Accessories Worse Current Gear Compare Gear Named Stunt Rider Desert Warrior Visor Bright Defense Team Boots Names Convey Stats Struggle Remember Shirt 136 Health 17 Stamina 5 Critical Hit Chance Negates Poison Status Effects Shop Bunch Shirts Stat Buffs Effects Add Setting Set Default Movement Speed Toggle Bunch Annoying Circumstances Game Toggles Player Walking 11 Pretty Easy Stuck Obstacles Sandrunning Competition Lost Race Stuck Boost Pad Ramp Hitting Forfeit Game Main Story Time Portia,POSITIVE,1,0,17,0,1.0
2023-10-24,"my time at sandrock is a fun farm/life sandbox game and the sequel to my time at portia, which i also recommend.

good:

housing is a big factor when it comes to farming games, in this game you can customize your farm however you want, you can make your land mainly like a factory, farm or a beautiful homestead while not worrying about the other two as much.

commissions are the main money maker in the game that also rewards you with a good amount of relationship for certain characters and workshop reputation points. i highly recommend doing these daily and picking the most profitable ones as money is more important than the other two rewards.

saving midday is not a common thing to happen in farm/life sim games and that is why i really like this game, (portia doesn't have this feature). also that comes with midday saves is when you complete a quest or commission you auto save and have a quick save which is really handy to have.

there are a large variety of weapons, you can have 4 types of melee weapons, multiple ranged weapons and even some unique weapons that can't be crafted. each melee weapon has its own style and combo, whether it be daggers for fast but weak attacks or a greatsword which is slow but does a lot of damage.

decent:

relationships in this game follows every other farm/life sim game, there isn't a weekly limit but if you give an item too much they will like it less. the game is good at indicating if there is a relationship event going on as it will be marked on your map but the game doesn't really tell you if you even have events available for a character or if it is just end of current build.

there is a skill tree that you can do, but maxing out those 4 skills basically just fill up the entire tree leaving no real choice in the end. skill points are only gained by doing those specific skills. though i do think this idea is pretty neat, i will always prefer character levels rewarding skill points (portia did this).

farming had a step-up from portia, where you are able to place farming plots anywhere on your land instead of planter boxes. you can easily and efficiently plant items the higher the toolbox up to a 4x4 planting/watering/fertilizing area which is quick and easy. farming has some flaws as well, farming early game is terrible. since it is just inefficient. you have to apply a lot of fertilizer, water and straw just to make a profit, you can't automate farming either so you have to constantly be on watch to water.

bad:

!!they added the feature to group items and move them in bulk in the 1.0 update!!

moving housing items is a real chore, there is no area select so you have to move each individual item one by one (including farming plots). i would just recommend using your character instead at some points. moving your house with 2+ stories is also annoying as whenever you move it, you have to move each individual story top to bottom and if you had items in the house after reapplying those stories, some might get removed since staircases don't remember their last known location but instead have a predetermined location every time you add a new floor.",2332,Time Sandrock Fun Farm Life Sandbox Game Sequel Time Portia Recommend Housing Factor Farming Games Game Customize Farm Land Factory Farm Beautiful Homestead Worrying Commissions Main Money Maker Game Rewards Relationship Characters Workshop Reputation Highly Recommend Daily Picking Profitable Money Rewards Saving Midday Common Happen Farm Life Sim Games Game Portia Feature Midday Saves Complete Quest Commission Auto Save Quick Save Handy Variety Weapons 4 Types Melee Weapons Multiple Ranged Weapons Unique Weapons Crafted Melee Weapon Style Combo Daggers Fast Weak Attacks Greatsword Slow Lot Damage Decent Relationships Game Farm Life Sim Game Weekly Limit Item Game Indicating Relationship Event Marked Map Game Events Character Current Build Skill Tree Maxing 4 Skills Basically Entire Tree Leaving Real Choice Skill Gained Specific Skills Idea Pretty Neat Prefer Character Levels Rewarding Skill Portia Farming Step Portia Farming Plots Land Planter Boxes Easily Efficiently Plant Items Toolbox 4X4 Planting Watering Fertilizing Quick Easy Farming Flaws Farming Game Terrible Inefficient Apply Lot Fertilizer Water Straw Profit Automate Farming Constantly Watch Water Bad Feature Items Bulk 1 0 Update Moving Housing Items Real Chore Select Individual Item Including Farming Plots Recommend Character Moving House 2 Stories Annoying Individual Story Items House Reapplying Stories Removed Staircases Remember Location Predetermined Location Time Add Floor,POSITIVE,1,0,6,0,1.0

2023-10-20,"this game is so much fun, i think i enjoyed all the character's personalities and the many voice actors the game had. i read a review before that said there is always a reason to do just one more day. this is so true. i'm about 120 hours game play in. i like to spend a lot of time doing side quests, gathering, and building. i want to be a rich builder. i just now got through a major plot in the story. i'm sure there is still hours of game play left. i played portia before when it first came out on switch. i struggled with it for some reason. building was hard for me and... i gave up. now that i played this one on pc, i think i'm actually ready to go back and give portia a try again. the story and all the mentions of portia makes me want to play it because i read that the timelines of the game are actually parallel? so while we are working hard to grow sandrock, there is a ""star builder"" in portia working hard to grow portia. now i must know the story! 
what i disliked is a pretty small list. the mounts can be a little glitch sometimes when they are following you. other times for some reason i can't seem to interact with an object, i have to run around and click on other things then try to come back to it. the most annoying one is sometimes if i have to pause and go out of game to do something on my desktop. when i come back, the mouse is missing and i can't click on stuff in my inventory. i normally have to save and restart for it to fix. pretty minor dislikes, none of them break the game. oh and for some reason when i pose with my camel a certain pose, the bottom of his mouth disappears! its creepy what the inside of his mouth looks like with no bottom of his face.",2515,Game Fun Enjoyed Character Personalities Voice Actors Game Read Review Reason Day True 120 Hours Game Play Spend Lot Time Quests Gathering Building Rich Builder Major Plot Story Hours Game Play Left Played Portia Switch Struggled Reason Building Hard Played Pc Ready Portia Story Mentions Portia Play Read Timelines Game Parallel Hard Grow Sandrock Star Builder Portia Hard Grow Portia Story Disliked Pretty List Mounts Glitch Times Reason Interact Object Annoying Pause Game Desktop Mouse Missing Stuff Inventory Save Restart Pretty Minor Dislikes Break Game Reason Pose Camel Pose Mouth Disappears Creepy Mouth,POSITIVE,1,0,6,0,1.0

2023-10-20,"wanted to write this before the official release of the game. 

i have 221 hours played on this game, spread over about three saves. if that doesn't speak about how much stuff there is to do, even in early access, then i don't know what would. 

obviously, the start was a bit rough, but overall the game was still pretty good. it continued improving as pathea kept listening to player feedback and making good decisions, eventually leaving me to believe it's one of, if not the, best game of its kind. beating even, i know i'll get questioned for this but whatever, stardew. it easily crushes portia, too. i loved portia, but sandrock improved on soooo much. in portia, it feels like you were just shoved into having to make a bunch of commissions, but in sandrock you get introduced to everything one at a time, which makes it easy to pick up. it also made it so it's much easier (and quicker) to start a relationship with a person, but i'll get into that later.

the main thing of the story is uncovering the truth about what's been going on in sandrock. the geeglers, the insidious, but dashingly handsome bandit logan, and even... an evil empire?! you'll play throughout all these events and make the town a thriving success like it used to be. you'll meet a ton of loveable, or annoying (yan), characters and get to know them and their story as you progress through the game.

another improvement is the combat. combat felt slow and sluggish in portia, and most farming/sim/crafting/rpg games do it poorly, but sandrock makes combat interesting and a little more interactive. it may not be overwhelmingly complex, but it's also not move and click. there are a few different melee weapons, each with their own bonus stat and fighting style, and then three, i think, ranged weapons: a pistol, rifle, shotgun. as i said, combat isn't super easy or simple, but it also isn't too hard. i think it's a definite improvement from portia and games like coral island or stardew that just have you face an enemy and spam click.

now i know i've compared this game to stardew twice already, and i will admit, it's not fair. both are great games with two massively different playstles. but i am judging both as a game about farming and/or crafting and social sims, like they both are, to some degree, but sandrock is a lot more story-oriented and emphasizes on combat, crafting, and exploration. so i'll stop comparing the two!

now on to make this simple:

character creation + development - 7/10. i want to give this a higher rating, but the character customization is lacking, especially for the males with no good facial hair options. maybe that'll change in the official release? idunno. anyway, i give it a 7 because you can get your character to a good looking person, and then the development of that character, including the adventures they go through and how you choose to treat people, matters too. i think it's a beautiful example of the fact that, sometimes, one person can make all the difference.

combat - 8/10. a good rating, i enjoyed the combat greatly. obviously it's no dark souls or anything like that, but it's a huge improvement from portia. and being able to choose a weapon you specialize in, or just specializing into all of them and switching between them, is so fluid and nice; especially when you get the shotgun. good lord is that fun.

exploration - 6/10. this would also be higher, but sadly a lot of the exploration is gated behind time and requirements. but when you do unlock a new zone, there isn't much to explore. yeah you get new materials to craft new and better equipment, but it does feel like you're stuck in a desert and can't go anywhere. 

socializing/romance - 9/10 beautiful! i loved getting to know all the characters in sandrock. i even got to bff with almost every available npc and got to know their story, though some of it came from game progression. but the romance is so much easier and better than portia. you can give gifts, go on ""play dates"" and eventually go on real dates and then get married! i haven't really dabbled in the marriage part because nia isn't available for romance yet as of writing this. *shakes fist* but i do know there are even children to be had! exciting! you won't get bored of any of these lovely sandrockers. 

graphics - 10/10 for the type of the game it is, the graphics are gorgeous. i love farming/dating sims, but usually have to settle for less-than appealing graphics, like potion permit, sun haven, etc. but with sandrock, you don't have to settle! they definitely made better looking people and areas than in portia. i hated how the heads were in portia, but in sandrock, it's all good, baby!

overall; the game is just.. awesome. i give it a solid 8/10, i have a few gripes and problems with it, as with every game to be fair, but maybe that'll change in the official release. is it worth it full price? heck yes! buy it. you will not be disappointed. it has a lot of replay-ability and tons of content. and here's hoping we'll get more content as time goes on! but yeah, that's my review of sandrock. i never write reviews for games unless they leave a great impression on me, i think the only other review i've ever made is on stardew. but yeah, anyway, sorry to digress. i definitely recommend the game, especially if it's on sale? heck of a deal. 

get it. play it.

2023-10-11,"if you liked my time at portia, then you'll like this game too, or perhaps even better.
after 100 hours into sandrock in 9 days, it's probably time for me to take it slow from now on. i've finished most of the main story stuff at this point but i think there's still a new area to unlock. it's been a long wait for sure. i bought the game the first day it was available on steam and waited till the main story questline was finished to finally play it. i'd say that the wait was worth it. overall, sandrock is better than portia in almost every aspect. i especially enjoyed the story and the characters. however, the game still feels a bit glitchy. there were a few crashes, the interact option sometimes won't appear immediately, my horse can fly, etc. i'll definitely have another playthrough once the definitive version is out (likely a year or so later i guess). 

here's a few things that i enjoyed the most:

1. the world

the view of sandrock is quite breathtaking and i often find it enjoyable just walking amongst the wilderness while gazing at the mountains. the biome and monster design is certainly a whole level better than portia (at least they make sense now). it's also quite rewarding to find little bits of lore here and there. 

2. story and characters

there's a lot more to the story of sandrock than portia, but in order to not spoil anything i'll just say that i liked it a lot. kudos to the writers. it also fleshes out the world a lot more that i'm now looking forward to the third game (please let there be a third game). i like the villains a lot, too. i especially like relatable villains. most of the romanceable characters are interesting and unique. i really enjoyed learning more and more about them and seeing some of them grow as a person. i might be biased, but i feel like the guys have more diverse personalities than the girls? like, i feel like all of the girls are the friendly and approachable type, but some of the guys need a lot more time to warm up to you. i kinda want to see a girl character being a jerk for a change. also, i suspect that unsuur is the dev's favorite considering how many quests he gets lol. 

despite how much i enjoyed the game, here's a few things that i didn't enjoy:

1. pacing (somewhere around mid-game to be more exact)
there's too much waiting mid-game that the game became kinda boring. since i played portia before, i was fairly familiar with the mechanics from the get go so i almost never wasted time on completing mandatory commissions. yet almost every main story quest requires you to wait for at least a day for the story to progress after you finished the job. maybe that's not so bad in itself, but nothing else was going on meanwhile except the main quests. the lag between the second abandoned ruins and the third was ridiculously long, while the forth was unlocked far too quickly in comparison (i hadn't even gotten to the bottom of the third ruins when the next was unlocked). the extremely repetitive guild commissions made it even worse. day in and day out, i was just handing out the same three or four items to the same people. the only thing i needed to gather was ores during that period and digging dirt for ores isn't exactly my idea of fun.

2. rival (or the lack of it...)
higgins was one of my favorite characters in portia and i was pretty disappointed with mi-an. it felt like she was just arbitrarily included in some parts of the story and absent in the rest. her character was rather uninteresting as well to the point the i rarely bothered talk to her. i'd talk to the non-romanceable townsfolk after most main story events but not her, that's how uninterested i was. her character is just inherently 'good' that she never had any character development (or perhaps there is but i'm not friends with her so i didn't get to see her events). the rest of the guild was just a joke. i don't feel any sense of accomplishment being called 'the best'. (my workshop score is currently around 20,000 and the second place is around 3,000. i almost feel bad for them.)

3. play and date
i haven't dated anyone yet since a certain someone only becomes available very late into the game, so i've only been hanging out with characters as friends so far. i noticed that characters now have multiple possible responses to each dialogue option so it's more worthwhile to chat with them multiple times. however, the activities available aren't that much of an improvement compared to portia imo. there are a few different mini-games, and that's it. it's basically the same formula. i was hoping that they could've made the dates less awkward  but perhaps romantic dates are better? oh well, i guess i'll find out soon. i know that with so many dateable characters in game it would be quite difficult to make the socializing aspect of the game more engaging, but still, no improvement or whatsoever is kind of a let down.",2579,Time Portia Game 100 Hours Sandrock 9 Days Time Slow Finished Main Story Stuff Unlock Wait Bought Game Day Steam Waited Main Story Questline Finished Finally Play Wait Worth Sandrock Portia Aspect Enjoyed Story Characters Game Feels Bit Glitchy Crashes Interact Option Horse Fly Playthrough Definitive Version Guess Enjoyed 1 View Sandrock Breathtaking Enjoyable Walking Wilderness Gazing Mountains Biome Monster Design Level Portia Sense Rewarding Bits Lore 2 Story Characters Lot Story Sandrock Portia Spoil Lot Kudos Writers Fleshes Lot Game Game Villains Lot Relatable Villains Romanceable Characters Unique Enjoyed Learning Grow Person Biased Feel Guys Diverse Personalities Girls Feel Girls Friendly Approachable Type Guys Lot Time Warm Kinda Girl Character Jerk Change Suspect Unsuur Dev Favorite Quests Lol Enjoyed Game Enjoy 1 Pacing Mid Game Exact Waiting Mid Game Game Kinda Boring Played Portia Familiar Mechanics Wasted Time Completing Mandatory Commissions Main Story Quest Requires Wait Day Story Progress Finished Job Bad Main Quests Lag Abandoned Ruins Ridiculously Unlocked Comparison Ruins Unlocked Extremely Repetitive Guild Commissions Worse Day Day Handing Items People Gather Ores Period Digging Dirt Ores Idea Fun 2 Rival Lack Higgins Favorite Characters Portia Pretty Disappointed Mi Arbitrarily Included Story Absent Rest Character Uninteresting Rarely Bothered Talk Talk Romanceable Townsfolk Main Story Events Uninterested Character Inherently Character Development Friends Events Rest Guild Joke Feel Sense Accomplishment Called Workshop Score 20 000 3 000 Feel Bad 3 Play Dated Late Game Hanging Characters Friends Noticed Characters Multiple Responses Dialogue Option Worthwhile Chat Multiple Times Activities Improvement Compared Portia Imo Mini Games Basically Formula Hoping Dates Awkward Romantic Dates Guess Dateable Characters Game Difficult Socializing Aspect Game Engaging Improvement Whatsoever,POSITIVE,1,0,5,1,0.8333333333333334

2023-11-04,"this is a general improvement of portia, with numerous qol improvements and better graphics.  if you want a chill builder sim game with a side of combat, this is a decent pick up.  that said there's a few things from the original that haven't improved:

-the combat is still too simplistic.  there are still no special attacks (the enemies get them, but not the player) so all you do for the most part is mash lmb and roll dodge once in a while.  there are ranged weapons, but having to constantly build more ammo is annoying so you'll just melee everything for the most part.
-the main story drags on way too long.  this was probably my main complaint about portia as well.  as another reviewer put it, there's an interesting major plotline where you fully expect the story to end afterwards but it drags on with more mundane busywork for another 10-15 hours.
-waiting on things.  you can speed up time to 3x speed at least without mods, but it can still take 15+ minutes of real time to smelt a stack of bars so a lot of the time you'll just toss stuff in and end the day to skip time.
-relation grind.  like the first game it is slow and tedious.  some characters aren't too bad because they constantly put up commissions which give a big chunk for something you want to do anyways, or are heavily involved in story missions.  others, like the doctor, require you go out of your way to talk to and constantly do boring crap like play critters (basically rock paper scissors with cards) over and over.  as a bonus middle finger, [spoiler]several characters leave partway through main story and get replaced by new ones[/spoiler].  hope you didn't waste your time on those ones!

2023-11-01,"i talked to a phone booth in the game that told me to leave a review with feedback, so i'm gonna do that!

this game's totally worth the asking price as-is, really elevates the farm life genre beyond stardew valley in pretty much every way (i loved stardew!), and offers a scintillating post-apocalyptic desert setting that feels really novel.

this game clearly has a lot to say about the way capital and a self-serving government can funnel money to prop up those who are already successful whilst leaving struggling communities to languish. there are tons of quests and side quests where characters ask if you can spot them money because the economy in sandrock is awful, and public servants will frequently lament the difficulty the town has getting government grants and the belief the residents should 'just move somewhere nicer' without regard for the town's unique culture or the financial hurdles one must jump over to be able to afford moving.

i'm still not done with the game's main story line even 80 hours in, but i'm excited to see how it further develops arguments between characters about the potential perils of technological advancement, because it seems like the game's religious faction is on the verge of lashing out at sandrock's local government for making use of scientific advancements to try and make the desert environment more habitable.

the game's premise also allows it to offer critique on world politics and modern society from the perspective of characters who are discovering information about us hundreds of years in the future. in the 'my time at' series' lore, to really simplify it, technology progressed with little oversight or regulation which made it trivially easy to start a world war that decimated most (all?) of the planet's surface and plunged the world into a new dark age, with people living underground until they were able to return to the surface and rebuild on top of the ruins.

i was surprised by the way this game tackles criticisms of the genre as being centered on mindless extractivism; the rationing of water from the local supply is a serious gameplay factory to account for, the logistical challenges of importing water from other towns is discussed frequently, and you're told as soon as you start the game that logging is illegal due to how few trees there are. plus there's a serious focus on scavenging for scraps and re-purposing those into materials.

this game really surprised me; i had kind of written it off because i thought the art style was a touch off-putting, but the narrative, character writing, and gameplay loops have all charmed and hooked me.

now, because that phone booth said the developers read reviews of the game for feedback, here's some very specific complaints i'd like addressed:

1. i'm in the summer of year two, partway through the bronco the kid quests, and i keep getting building commissions for items i cannot complete because i haven't met musa yet, which means i haven't gained access to the areas that unlock when he shows up in town. some of the commissions i've seen posted but can't complete are industrial machine tools, the advanced civil processor, and chromium daggers. i have these recipes already because i've been diligent about doing machine research with qi and buying recipes from the commerce guild, but i think the game should check to see whether the player has the ability to get the materials necessary to make something before it pops up as a commission.

2. after you first get the chance to express romantic interest in elsie, there's a line of dialogue where she declares 'i'm a legal adult' in frustration at the way her parents treat her. i appreciate the effort to make it clear she's not too young to ethically date, but she's very childish, and that line just makes her sound more childish. the mention of legality feels like a reassurance to the player, which doesn't make for good character dialog.

3. at some point, jumping with my camel started causing the game to freeze in the air for a half-second, after which it hits the ground and all four hoof-hitting-ground sounds play one right after the other. i swear the jumping animation used to be way smoother without that hitch and without the weird sound; i don't have performance issues in this game, so it's not lag as far as i can tell.

4. sometimes machines will get stuck saying they need to have the sand cleaned out of them, and no matter how many different positions or angles i try i cannot see a sand pile to remove with my duster. i found that picking the machine up and putting it back down fixes it temporarily, but i would prefer to just not have that issue, it's annoying having to finesse the position of a civil furnace that sits between two other furnaces.

5. i need storage to be sortable across all boxes instead of the 'sort' option just sorting that individual storage box, as well as the ability to search for an item in storage by name. i would also like for storage to always be accessible when you're gifting a character something. it's frustrating going through my 10? 12? large storage boxes, each with two pages of items to scroll through, especially since item names are only visible by using the left stick and going over every item.

6. finding relic parts for qi's side quests is too time consuming. i would prefer the quest-necessary relic pieces be located in chests in the ruins rather than in the dirt; i haven't found the scanner particularly effective at locating the quest pieces, so i've just been hitting every piece of dirt i can find on every floor hoping to uncover a relic piece eventually, which is extremely tedious when i also really need to move on to a new floor for the ores so i have the materials to complete my commissions.

7. the lack of tin scrap makes bronze more difficult to craft than stuff like chromium or manganese steel, and i'm not sure why that's the case given bronze is required for crafting so many different things.

8. there should be an option to turn on alerts for commissions that are going to expire that day. even if you're tracking your commissions that are due the soonest, you won't see when the commission expires on the main screen.

9. the shop interface should tell you whether clothing/accessories are better or worse than your current gear; i can't really compare my gear when it's all named something like 'stunt rider desert warrior visor' or 'bright defense team boots' since those names don't convey anything about their stats. it's also a struggle to remember my shirt provides, for example, '+136 health + 17 stamina +5% critical hit chance + negates poison status effects' when i'm in a shop going through a bunch of different shirts all with different stat buffs and effects.

10. add a setting that lets run be set as the default movement speed, please. using the 'toggle' doesn't work because there a bunch of annoying circumstances where the game toggles the player back to walking.

11. it's pretty easy to get stuck on obstacles in the sandrunning competition, and i lost a race because i got stuck under a boost pad ramp after hitting it from the side and had to forfeit to get out.

all of that said though, it's a great game, i'm looking forward to getting through the main story so i can go try my time at portia after this!",2157,Talked Phone Booth Game Told Leave Review Feedback Gonna Game Totally Worth Price Elevates Farm Life Genre Stardew Valley Pretty Loved Stardew Offers Scintillating Post Apocalyptic Desert Setting Feels Game Lot Capital Serving Government Funnel Money Prop Successful Leaving Struggling Communities Languish Tons Quests Quests Characters Spot Money Economy Sandrock Awful Public Servants Frequently Lament Difficulty Town Government Grants Belief Residents Nicer Regard Town Unique Culture Financial Hurdles Jump Afford Moving Game Main Story 80 Hours Excited Develops Arguments Characters Potential Perils Technological Advancement Game Religious Faction Verge Lashing Sandrock Local Government Scientific Advancements Desert Environment Habitable Game Premise Offer Critique Politics Modern Society Perspective Characters Discovering Hundreds Future Time Series Lore Simplify Technology Progressed Oversight Regulation Trivially Easy Start War Decimated Planet Surface Plunged Dark Age People Living Underground Return Surface Rebuild Ruins Surprised Game Tackles Criticisms Genre Centered Mindless Extractivism Rationing Water Local Supply Gameplay Factory Account Logistical Challenges Importing Water Towns Discussed Frequently Told Start Game Logging Illegal Trees Focus Scavenging Scraps Purposing Materials Game Surprised Written Art Style Touch Putting Narrative Character Writing Gameplay Loops Charmed Hooked Phone Booth Developers Read Reviews Game Feedback Specific Complaints Addressed 1 Summer Partway Bronco Kid Quests Building Commissions Items Complete Met Musa Gained Access Unlock Town Commissions Posted Complete Industrial Machine Tools Advanced Civil Processor Chromium Daggers Recipes Diligent Machine Qi Buying Recipes Commerce Guild Game Check Player Ability Materials Pops Commission 2 Chance Express Romantic Elsie Dialogue Declares Legal Adult Frustration Parents Treat Effort Ethically Childish Sound Childish Mention Legality Feels Reassurance Player Character Dialog 3 Jumping Camel Started Causing Game Freeze Air Hits Ground Hoof Hitting Ground Sounds Play Swear Jumping Animation Smoother Hitch Weird Sound Performance Issues Game Lag 4 Machines Stuck Sand Cleaned Matter Positions Angles Sand Pile Remove Duster Picking Machine Putting Fixes Temporarily Prefer Issue Annoying Finesse Position Civil Furnace Sits Furnaces 5 Storage Sortable Boxes Sort Option Sorting Individual Storage Box Ability Search Item Storage Storage Accessible Gifting Character Frustrating 12 Storage Boxes Items Scroll Item Names Visible Left Stick Item 6 Finding Relic Qi Quests Time Consuming Prefer Quest Relic Pieces Located Chests Ruins Dirt Scanner Effective Locating Quest Pieces Hitting Piece Dirt Floor Hoping Uncover Relic Piece Eventually Extremely Tedious Floor Ores Materials Complete Commissions 7 Lack Tin Scrap Bronze Difficult Craft Stuff Chromium Manganese Steel Bronze Required Crafting 8 Option Alerts Commissions Expire Day Tracking Commissions Soonest Commission Expires Main Screen 9 Shop Interface Clothing Accessories Worse Current Gear Compare Gear Named Stunt Rider Desert Warrior Visor Bright Defense Team Boots Names Convey Stats Struggle Remember Shirt 136 Health 17 Stamina 5 Critical Hit Chance Negates Poison Status Effects Shop Bunch Shirts Stat Buffs Effects Add Setting Set Default Movement Speed Toggle Bunch Annoying Circumstances Game Toggles Player Walking 11 Pretty Easy Stuck Obstacles Sandrunning Competition Lost Race Stuck Boost Pad Ramp Hitting Forfeit Game Main Story Time Portia,POSITIVE,1,0,17,0,1.0

2023-11-12,"my time at sandrock is an amazing sequel to my time at portia. it improves on most parts while only keeping a few weaknesses it's predecessor had. to keep it short:

+runs better
+no more inventory management (your machines automatically use items from your chests, and you can scroll through all chests at once), but it still keeps the inventory when gifting items/donating to the museum (why though? please fix this)
+an interesting story (it's nothing groundbreaking, but it keeps you hooked), however the story has 2 plotlines and the 2nd one keeps dragging on for just a bit too long imo (if the pacing was improved, a solid 10 hours of gametime could be cut, which would fix this imo)
+improved overall gameplay (combat is better, mines are now actually designed instead of randomly generated, big enemy variety, several weapon options)
+better cast (i disliked it more in the first few hours, but the more time i put into it, the more i grew to prefer it over the first cast), additionally, the game doesnt shy from adding or taking away characters halfway through the story, keeping the cast fresh
+improved farming, improved pet keeping, improved mount-system and unlockable options to modify your house and workshop from home (no more running to the upgrade-store)

~new building system for housing. originally i liked it a lot, but its very shallow. the lack of options to build as well as the lack of forms for building really put a dent into this for me (no triangles, round houses etc.) and the factory and greenhouse also got worked into this and are now basically quadratic blocks with little to no customization, so they look worse like the old versions but also dont improve on them gameplaywise.
~bigger focus on socializing - the game has a lot of small quests which tell you stories about the individual characters, their relationships with each others and their backstories. i put it in mixed because some people prefer the core gameplay loop, but if you enjoy the social-part, this puts games like sdv in the dust
~bigger focus on combat and platforming - i mentioned earlier that sandrock improved on combat. however, it's still not good. you can work with it, it does what it has to do, but thats it. and focusing a big part of the story on the workable combat and clunky platforming simply doesnt work and is frustrating. personally, those were the most dreadful parts, despite the devs working some of the best ideas into them.

-all those nitpicks i had lead to me feeling like the game was simply not quite finished. it reminded me a lot of baldurs gate 3, where the start was so well thought through and everything worked perfectly but as you got into the later parts of the game it starts to feel as if they didnt work it through enough.
-same goes for performance. the game runs overall a lot better than portia, but as you get into the later parts of the game, you get more bugs, such as textures not loading, small lagspikes and characters not working or completely disappearing.

overall i give sandrock a 7/10. if they fix the bugs and improve on the factory and greenhouse the game can easily become an 8-9/10 and one of the strongest condenders in the genre, next to stardew valley.",18838,Time Sandrock Amazing Sequel Time Portia Improves Keeping Weaknesses Predecessor Short Runs Inventory Management Machines Automatically Items Chests Scroll Chests Inventory Gifting Items Donating Museum Story Groundbreaking Hooked Story 2 Plotlines 2Nd Dragging Bit Imo Pacing Improved Solid Hours Gametime Cut Imo Improved Gameplay Combat Mines Designed Randomly Generated Enemy Variety Weapon Options Cast Disliked Hours Time Grew Prefer Cast Additionally Game Shy Adding Characters Halfway Story Keeping Cast Fresh Improved Farming Improved Pet Keeping Improved Mount Unlockable Options Modify House Workshop Running Upgrade Store Building Housing Originally Lot Shallow Lack Options Build Lack Forms Building Dent Triangles Houses Factory Greenhouse Basically Quadratic Blocks Customization Worse Versions Improve Gameplaywise Bigger Focus Socializing Game Lot Quests Stories Individual Characters Relationships Backstories Mixed People Prefer Core Gameplay Loop Enjoy Social Games Sdv Dust Bigger Focus Combat Platforming Mentioned Earlier Sandrock Improved Combat Focusing Story Workable Combat Clunky Platforming Simply Frustrating Personally Dreadful Devs Ideas Nitpicks Lead Feeling Game Simply Finished Reminded Lot Baldurs Gate 3 Start Perfectly Game Starts Feel Performance Game Runs Lot Portia Game Bugs Textures Loading Lagspikes Characters Completely Disappearing Sandrock 7 Bugs Improve Factory Greenhouse Game Easily 8 9 Strongest Condenders Genre Stardew Valley,POSITIVE,1,0,50,8,0.8620689655172413

2023-11-15,"he's a 10, buuuuut.....

overall this is a pretty good game, and there's a lot of fun to be had in it. despite my negative review, i will keep playing it. and if you like games like stardew valley, you'll almost certainly like this one. the basic gameplay loop is fine - great even, if a little stale after awhile. and the story - likewise very enjoyable! the characters are, for the most part, unique and interesting and generally quite humorous. overall i should be able to recommend this game. so why don't i?

it's the little things. lots and lots of little things. for me, i play a game like this as a kind of escapism. i lose myself in the story and in getting to know the cast of characters - however cheesy it all might be. and in general, this game provides that better than most you might play, without the heaping dose of grim reality and tragedy you'll get from something like baldur's gate 3. it's a happy escapist fantasy. until you encounter (not bugs, because i did not encounter any that were not ultimately harmless and funny) some of the poorly or lazily implemented features.

obviously, you can date and marry and have kids with a good number of the characters. this is to be expected of this genre, and the process of getting to know these characters, through a variety of quests and events both focused on them and not, is quite a bit of fun. you will probably become quite invested in them. until you finish their content and they become hollow and uninteresting shells. they don't do or say anything new or interesting past a certain point - which is to be expected, but it is exacerbated by other things as i will point out. the dating/hangout mini game becomes a chore because after a couple of those you will have exhausted the dialogue with a given character - and that dialogue will not update even if you are actively in a relationship or married to the character. 

to make matters even worse, the story will not take any of this into account. whether or not you are dating a given character, or married to them even, will never come up outside of the one off wedding event or when talking to that character directly to get one of their canned lines of repetitive marriage dialogue - which are cute sure enough, but you can only hear them so many times before they lose all their charm. 

for a truly horrible example of how absurd this can get, at one point during the story you are to venture into a toxic environment full of extremely hostile enemies that want to kill you. all well and good, yea? well, if you are married to one of the characters involved, that character could be pregnant at the time of this quest. this does not come up...so your fun little happy escapism is irreparably ruined because the game is now sending your pregnant wife into a life and death situation because the smallest effort was not made to actually integrate the relationship and marriage system into the story in any way. 

and speaking of pregnancy, it's hilarious - from  a male character's perspective, i do not know how it differs if you play a female character and are the one to get pregnant. you will be teleported one morning to the hospital to see your spouse holding the baby, you will be prompted to name it, pick what the child will call you, and then you will be returned home. your spouse will be gone, already off following their preset schedule (which does not change even when you marry them by the way, they still follow the same routine as they do by default, except when it is interupted by the tasks you can choose to assign them). when you catch up to them...not a single damn mention of the baby they just pushed out. the entire system is barely implemented and it's kind of ridiculous. harvest moon 64 almost 30 years ago had a more robust and interesting system of marriage and children. what they've cobbled together here has the bones of something perfectly adequate, great even, but there is basically no connective tissue to bring it all together. 

overall, the game is quite good for what it is, and despite my negativity there is much to enjoy. but this is a life sim game, and the quite frankly pathetic implementation of some very important systems to the success of a game in that genre - dating, marriage, and children - leave a massive gaping hole in it. fixing these things would not even require a massive revamp of the game. just some basic time and care to make these choices feel as impactful as they should. lockout marriage until a point in the story where it cant create awkward situations, for example. implement new dialogues to accurately reflect relationship changes - despite all the voice acting a significant amount of the dialogue is unvoiced, so it is not even a question of needing to record new lines. just write more dialogue and shove it in there.",11594,Buuuuut Pretty Game Lot Fun Negative Review Playing Games Stardew Valley Basic Gameplay Loop Fine Stale Awhile Story Enjoyable Characters Unique Humorous Recommend Game Lots Lots Play Game Escapism Lose Story Cast Characters Cheesy Game Play Heaping Dose Grim Reality Tragedy Baldur Gate 3 Happy Escapist Fantasy Encounter Bugs Encounter Ultimately Harmless Funny Lazily Implemented Features Marry Kids Characters Expected Genre Process Characters Variety Quests Events Focused Bit Fun Invested Finish Content Hollow Uninteresting Shells Expected Exacerbated Dating Hangout Mini Game Chore Couple Exhausted Dialogue Character Dialogue Update Actively Relationship Married Character Matters Worse Story Account Dating Character Married Wedding Event Talking Character Canned Lines Repetitive Marriage Dialogue Cute Hear Times Lose Charm Horrible Absurd Story Venture Toxic Environment Extremely Hostile Enemies Kill Yea Married Characters Involved Character Pregnant Time Quest Fun Happy Escapism Irreparably Ruined Game Sending Pregnant Wife Life Death Situation Effort Integrate Relationship Marriage Story Speaking Pregnancy Hilarious Male Character Perspective Differs Play Female Character Pregnant Teleported Morning Hospital Spouse Holding Baby Prompted Pick Child Returned Spouse Preset Schedule Change Marry Follow Routine Default Interupted Tasks Choose Assign Catch Single Damn Mention Baby Pushed Entire Barely Implemented Ridiculous Harvest Moon 64 30 Robust Marriage Children Cobbled Bones Perfectly Adequate Basically Connective Tissue Bring Game Negativity Enjoy Life Sim Game Frankly Pathetic Implementation Systems Success Game Genre Dating Marriage Children Leave Massive Gaping Hole Fixing Require Massive Revamp Game Basic Time Care Choices Feel Impactful Lockout Marriage Story Create Awkward Situations Implement Dialogues Accurately Reflect Relationship Voice Acting Dialogue Unvoiced Question Record Lines Write Dialogue Shove,POSITIVE,1,0,42,1,0.9767441860465116
2023-11-15,"this is a hard one to judge. this game is a culmination of both what i love and hate about modern video games.

pros:
* the game loop isn't bad. it's similar to the predecessor and they didn't modify it much from there. 
* the characters in the game are pretty decent and distinct. some of them develop in unexpected ways which is neat.
* there ""larger than life"" events that do better than what its predecessor had.
* the conveniences later on are better than what was in its predecessor (with unfortunate caveats due to bugs).
* a cozy quality-of-life game.

cons:
* this game is buggy to a point i'm not sure how the hell it was released like it was. some of the bugs are similar to what i saw in early versions of its predecessor game which tells me they didn't learn much from their mistakes in implementation. i've made a list i can remember off the top of my head below.

* the combat is pretty weak. i didn't pay much attention to the early access but i was hoping they'd really make the combat more interesting. make no mistake that it's definitely better than what portia had. there's more variety here but it's literally ""smash the x button"" when you get down to it.

* after awhile, farming and mining stuff becomes repetitive which thankfully becomes easier. [strike]unfortunately, because the factory has such a fucked up implementation and literally doesn't work half the time, that convenience can be more irritating than helpful.[/strike] there's also no way to farm certain stuff or to get someone else to fetch it like agate. you have to go out and spend 5-10 minutes picking them 2 at a time. this isn't as big of a deal though, you don't generally need agate that often but for example, flourite you do since certain items that show up on commission require it to increase rarity. the only other way to get that is through ruin tokens which is already expensive and time consuming to obtain....

* some commissions are a trap. it might look easy but they want increased rarity on something like a steel bar which requires flourite to create which is an absolute pain in the ass to get. these commissions are never worth the gold they give (and they don't give much generally). they're there to make you feel miserable. the game should give double gold for such requests or triple gold for rare quality items.

all that said... i've already gotten over 100 hours out of it and i'll probably finish it. i'd wait for a sale but i'd be lying if i said i didn't enjoy it. there isn't really any challenge to it which kinda kills it a little bit. you can fail some stuff but you either have to try to fail it or fail it via a bug. 

bugs i saw while playing:
* literally first five minutes into the game, you'll notice that coco the bird fly's sideways and slow as if running into a wall. literally shows in one of the earliest cutscenes as you start playing.

* mobs and npcs end up your workshop seemingly lost, as if their pathing is telling them to go there for some reason and then they just literally run around doing nothing.

* soft locks are brimming in this game. they seem to be worse when you play the game for extended periods of time which brings me to...

* the game has some issues when played for long periods of time. things load slower or not at all, animations are wonkier, sound may not occur at all having you miss actually interesting voice lines.

* [strike]the factory you get later into the game is a broken mess. the ui doesn't update properly, parts of the ui doesn't work with controller for some reason, and multiple times now i've had the recycler ""production queue"" absolutely busted to where it was unusable. things that should produce more than one of a thing, for example bullets (5 each) or copper screws (2 each), will only produce one which is a clear bug since it shouldn't take fucking 20 steel bars and 50 gunpowder to make literally 10 rifle bullets, but doing the same thing directly on a forge would give you 50.[/strike] this was fixed in latest patch of this writing.

* npcs will fall to the bottom of the map, teleport endlessly, float in the sky or just out of reach, or not be able to interact with them at all until you leave the room or restart the game even.

* npc pathing will often put them smack dab in the middle of a cutscene where they mob pile to the point you can't see anything going on anymore.

* i've softlocked on a lot of scenes that want your character to automatically moved but apparently, i'm alone in this according to the forums.

* i've had the planting grid get stuck in 5x5 when in 4x4 mode, then plant incorrectly. this was with the robot: f machine. edit: there is a 5x5 mode later in the game but the robot isn't supposed to have it. 

* quests not triggering which would then fail after time passes.

* too many events scheduled at once. i had several quests on the same day as the day of memories, all at 1600.  they not only won't reschedule any of them, they also will cause bugs like not letting you join the ghost hunting event.

* probably more i'm not thinking of or too small of a bug to care.",11594,Hard Judge Game Culmination Love Hate Modern Video Games Pros Game Loop Bad Predecessor Modify Characters Game Pretty Decent Distinct Develop Unexpected Neat Larger Life Events Predecessor Conveniences Predecessor Unfortunate Caveats Bugs Cozy Quality Life Game Cons Game Buggy Released Bugs Versions Predecessor Game Tells Learn Mistakes Implementation List Remember Head Combat Pretty Weak Pay Attention Access Hoping Combat Mistake Portia Variety Literally Smash Button Awhile Farming Mining Stuff Repetitive Thankfully Easier Strike Factory Fucked Implementation Literally Time Convenience Irritating Helpful Strike Farm Stuff Fetch Agate Spend 5 Minutes Picking 2 Time Deal Agate Flourite Items Commission Require Increase Rarity Ruin Tokens Expensive Time Consuming Commissions Trap Easy Increased Rarity Steel Bar Requires Flourite Create Absolute Pain Ass Commissions Worth Gold Feel Miserable Game Double Gold Requests Triple Gold Rare Quality Items 100 Hours Finish Wait Sale Lying Enjoy Challenge Kinda Kills Bit Fail Stuff Fail Fail Bug Bugs Playing Literally Minutes Game Notice Coco Bird Fly Sideways Slow Running Wall Literally Earliest Cutscenes Start Playing Mobs Npcs Workshop Seemingly Lost Pathing Telling Reason Literally Soft Locks Brimming Game Worse Play Game Extended Periods Time Brings Game Issues Played Periods Time Load Slower Animations Wonkier Sound Occur Voice Lines Strike Factory Game Broken Mess Ui Update Properly Ui Controller Reason Multiple Times Recycler Production Queue Absolutely Busted Unusable Produce Bullets 5 Copper Screws 2 Produce Bug Fucking 20 Steel Bars 50 Gunpowder Literally Rifle Bullets Forge 50 Strike Fixed Patch Writing Npcs Fall Map Teleport Endlessly Float Sky Reach Interact Leave Restart Game Npc Pathing Smack Dab Middle Cutscene Mob Pile Softlocked Lot Scenes Character Automatically Moved Forums Planting Grid Stuck 5X5 4X4 Mode Plant Incorrectly Robot Machine Edit 5X5 Mode Game Robot Supposed Quests Triggering Fail Time Passes Events Scheduled Quests Day Day Memories 1600 Reschedule Bugs Letting Ghost Hunting Event Thinking Bug Care,POSITIVE,1,0,42,1,0.9767441860465116
2023-11-14,"if you love farming/building simulation games, you will most likely love this one. i have not even finished the game yet, but i wanted to post an honest and informative review while the game is at the height of attention. this is by far the #1 game in the genre for me. i normally do short and sweet reviews, but for a game like this i want to go over some of the important aspects of it that may make or break the players experience. so let me explain the good, the bad, and the ugly.

[b]the good[/b]:
-outstanding amount of content. you can see by my playtime that i have put in a significant amount of time. i have not even finished the main story yet, and i am not actually sure how close i am to the end. there is plenty of upgrades, levels, npc content, and building/farming to be done here

-you can have a farm with plants, chickens, buffalo, bunnies, and mounts

-there are about 20 or so romance-able npc's, all with their own character growth and story arcs along side the main story. some of them are very well done and interesting while others are not quite as fleshed out, but still enjoyable

-combat in the game is quick-paced hack-n-slash shoot-em-up style. there are ""dungeons"" to breeze through where you can get treasure, materials, and glory

-festivals are a lot of fun. you unlock more festivals as the game progresses and there are fun little mini games and unique events for each one of them.

-character creation is a bit similar to my time at portia and there are a lot of lore-friendly outfits and accessories you can use to personalize your builder. the hairstyles and coloring can be customized quite a bit to give you a unique look as well

-you can go on dates and hangout with the friends you meet in town, you can play mini games in an arcade and even mahjong at a later portion of the game.

-progression is slow but it feels great. every new house and machine upgrade you get feels like an achievement. you can upgrade your mounts, raise animals, have a huge farm, and it all feels earned. once you get more levels for your workshop and character and progress the main story you can automate collection of resources to help your progression quite a bit.

-the developers are awesome and are constantly replying to concerns and bug reports in the forums, as well as trying to improve the game.

[b]the bad[/b]:
-progression is slow. i know i stated this above, but people with not a lot of time on their hands may feel that they are not getting anywhere. a lot of this probably has a lot to do with how fast you decide to progress time. you can choose anywhere from 0.6x-3.0 time progression speed, and i believe that can have an impact on the pace of the game and how quickly it goes by. i like to take things slow and experience everything the game has to offer, so i have it set at 0.6.

-stamina and time can be hard to manage at first. you may feel a struggle early game trying to get the resources you need and finishing missions on time. this caveat goes away after getting some levels and experience under your belt. a lot of people feel a struggle at the beginning. taking the game slow is a good idea at the beginning until you get used to it.

-certain resources are very hard to get such as electronics, certain plants, trees, or animal resources. some of this stuff you need for progression but it is hard or impossible to automate in any way at the beginning. when you do commissions/missions for townsfolk, if you are not careful then you won't be able to complete them on time. this is why it is good to take it slow at the beginning and learn the ins-and-outs. this adds to early game struggle and gives a sense of not getting anywhere.

-some of the romance-able npc's don't really have much character development or story missions, decreasing their interesting aspect.

-the house building/decorating leaves much to be desired. it is difficult to place objects or know what objects to place in certain circumstances. the building ui is clunky and not user friendly. it can be struggle to get a look that you like. there are mismatched patterns or just plain ugly ones when making roofs or rooms. they honestly should have hired a color expert or interior decorator because some combinations of design can be atrocious. this part of the game is passable and you can get something that you are satisfied with, but it could take some workaround.

-workshop upgrades are incredibly expensive, to the point where you have to grind money for a long time to get room for all of the workshop add-ons, machines, and other goodies. it took me a good month of in game time to get an upgrade that would give me enough building space to extend my house because of how much money it was to get it. this part of the game feels a bit unbalanced, especially with how much money you will be spending elsewhere.

[b]the ugly[/b]
-this game is bethesda level buggy as of right now. i am not even remotely exaggerating. there are issues with npc's disappearing out of nowhere, floating mounts that you can't ride because they are stuck in the air, a visual bug that messes with some resource contracts, unclear missions markers or explanations etc.

-some missions have a timer on them. so you need to complete it in a certain number of days. there are several missions that you will fail for no reason at all with no in-game timer attached to them. these missions show no sign and give no hint of a fail-trigger, but if you don't do them then you will fail them at some point for what seems like no reason. i have had this happen a few times. this is usually with side missions. 

-you need to save a lot. there are some potentially game breaking bugs and missions you can screw up through no fault of your own, as stated above. it is a good idea to have several hard saves just in case something undesirable happens that messes up your progress with missions, npc's, or other aspects.

-the game does not run well sometimes. i get around ~60 fps pretty consistently, but certain areas, scenes, or events can cause huge framerate drops to as low as 15 fps, and i have had the game crash on me once. some people report even worse performance, but for me it is tolerable. i have a pretty decent gaming computer. i can run cyberpunk on max with a constant 60-70 fps, and this game performs slightly worse in certain cases. i will say that it seems they have ironed out some of this in the last week or so since my performance seems to have improved over the last couple days. in particular, when the train comes into town is one of the points where i get an fps drop to 15, but earlier today it did not drop when the train came in.

the game is by no means perfect, but it is my favorite game in the genre. if you liked portia or games like stardew valley, coral island, or any other popular sim games like this, then you will probably love this one. the developers are constantly looking at feedback and improving the game, so i am almost positive all of the negatives i pointed out will be fixed at some point in the future. they have already been actively releasing post-launch updates and they even intend to add more content eventually from what i have read. the developers and this game have my full confidence and support!

2023-11-14,"let's just get the important bit out of the way first: this is my 2023 game of the year. it was only a matter of when the game would come out of early access to claim its crown. since this game hit on nov. 2, i nominated it for the steam award.

now then, on to why this game is, as of this writing, my 6th most-played title in terms of hours on my steam account.

it's basically everything from my time at portia, but improved upon and made better in every possible way. the world is bigger, the building mechanics refined to a visible-from-space shine, the action rpg story fleshed out in a way that makes it the primary driver of gameplay rather than purely a framing device.

indeed, this is less a cozy game with action-rpg elements and more a reimagining of the action rpg formula where cozy game mechanics are the primary driver of progression. the genres blend seamlessly in a way that they never have before—looking at you, horizon zero dawn and forbidden west and every ubisoft game, where the crafting is tedious and feels unnecessary.

but at the same time, this game also has a cozy soul. if you're played any harvest moon-like, the life sim elements are exactly what you want them to be and then some. building relationships with villagers, romance, family life, it's all there with plenty of choices and some remarkably well-written relationship and character backstory dialogue. there are just so many ways to get a villager's friendship up compared to, say, stardew valley's more traditional talk-and-gift approach, and with the anti-frustration feature of not having to talk to every villager every day just to keep their relationship level from backsliding.

speaking of anti-frustration features, there are plenty more in this game as well. none of the main story quests are timed; complete them at your leisure. get overleveled if the combat's not your strong suit. rush the main story quests to unlock more of the crafting recipes if that's your jam. speedrunners and challenge runners? go to town, the game's got plenty of measurable ways to keep score. 

almost none of the sidequests are timed. if you unlock them too fast, as happens when you're powering through the main quest and hitting every character's sidequest trigger faster than you can bang them out, well, take a step back and take your time. the devs listened to players during the early access stage of the process and took the most common frustration—players felt rushed—out of the game. you want to complete them as fast as possible, nothing's stopping you. but it all fits in with the overarching theme of well-camouflaged accessibility that never feels like it's being dumbed down.

as for the action and combat in the action rpg, well, the devs know they're not from software. this isn't going to challenge anyone with a firm grounding in action games. you can overpower just about anything in the game because the devs have consciously avoided the bethesda syndrome of level-scaling enemies. well, with one exception—going too far afield in a sandstorm is going to surprise you the first time you run into high-level versions of basic enemies—but even that is a smart stylistic choice that makes sandstorms feel appropriately dangerous and threatening for a game set against the backdrop of a desert environment with a strong ""green aesop"" running through the main story.

is the game perfect? well, no, no game is perfect, not even games that are otherwise among the greatest of all time (i say this as someone who loved everything about red dead redemption 2 except for the on-rails quest design, for example.)

for one thing, the fishing minigame is one of the weakest i've seen in this genre. it's simplistic and repetitive and offers almost no challenge and very little reason to even engage with it beyond a couple of cooking recipes. this is a shame, especially since portia's fishing minigame was quite fun and other games like stardew, animal crossing (and dinkum, which cribs heavily from it), and even red dead 2 have great outdoorsman-style fishing gameplay.

in addition, there are a couple of dungeons in the midgame that have a jarring tonal shift toward platformer gameplay. thankfully the devs refined it a bit after its initial introduction; jumps are more forgiving, there's plenty of ""coyote time"" with ledges, and there's the option to skip the trickiest segments if you fail them enough times, but for a game that otherwise has good dungeon design, there's a heavy ""why, devs?"" when playing the two dungeons in question.

but those are minor quibbles in a game that is otherwise the absolute apex of the cozy game genre with one heck of a story rpg to go with it.

absolutely, by miles, my 2023 game of the year. 10/10.",12878,Bit 2023 Game Matter Game Access Claim Crown Game Hit Nov 2 Nominated Steam Award Game Writing 6Th Played Title Terms Hours Steam Account Basically Time Portia Improved Bigger Building Mechanics Refined Visible Space Shine Action Rpg Story Fleshed Primary Driver Gameplay Purely Framing Device Cozy Game Action Rpg Elements Reimagining Action Rpg Formula Cozy Game Mechanics Primary Driver Progression Genres Blend Seamlessly Horizon Dawn Forbidden West Ubisoft Game Crafting Tedious Feels Unnecessary Time Game Cozy Soul Played Harvest Moon Life Sim Elements Building Relationships Villagers Romance Family Life Plenty Choices Remarkably Written Relationship Character Backstory Dialogue Villager Friendship Compared Stardew Valley Traditional Talk Gift Approach Anti Frustration Feature Talk Villager Day Relationship Level Backsliding Speaking Anti Frustration Features Plenty Game Main Story Quests Timed Complete Leisure Overleveled Combat Strong Suit Rush Main Story Quests Unlock Crafting Recipes Jam Speedrunners Challenge Runners Town Game Plenty Measurable Score Sidequests Timed Unlock Fast Powering Main Quest Hitting Character Sidequest Trigger Faster Bang Step Time Devs Listened Players Access Stage Process Common Frustration Players Rushed Game Complete Fast Stopping Fits Overarching Theme Camouflaged Accessibility Feels Dumbed Action Combat Action Rpg Devs Software Challenge Firm Grounding Action Games Overpower Game Devs Consciously Avoided Bethesda Syndrome Level Scaling Enemies Exception Afield Sandstorm Surprise Time Level Versions Basic Enemies Smart Stylistic Choice Sandstorms Feel Appropriately Dangerous Threatening Game Set Backdrop Desert Environment Strong Green Aesop Running Main Story Game Perfect Game Perfect Games Time Loved Red Dead Redemption 2 Rails Quest Design Fishing Minigame Weakest Genre Simplistic Repetitive Offers Challenge Reason Engage Couple Cooking Recipes Shame Portia Fishing Minigame Fun Games Stardew Animal Crossing Dinkum Cribs Heavily Red Dead 2 Outdoorsman Style Fishing Gameplay Addition Couple Dungeons Midgame Jarring Tonal Shift Platformer Gameplay Thankfully Devs Refined Bit Initial Introduction Jumps Forgiving Plenty Coyote Time Ledges Option Skip Trickiest Segments Fail Times Game Dungeon Design Heavy Devs Playing Dungeons Question Minor Quibbles Game Absolute Apex Cozy Game Genre Heck Story Rpg Absolutely Miles 2023 Game,POSITIVE,1,0,49,3,0.9423076923076923
2023-11-14,"pretty full synopsis, no spoilers... except for the stupid actor part... which doesn't really spoil anything... it's the equivalent of saying, ""guy walks outside"" oh my gosh... he really did walk outside! spoilersss. i'm confident it wouldn't be the thing that kept me out of heaven by saying no spoilers...

if you liked my time at portia, you'll like this one. the controls are  basically the same with some minor differences that take getting used to. key difference i find amazing is that your storage is linked to your inventory when building, as well as most cases when giving gifts or completing quests. i found one instance where i couldn't give something in my storage and it's probably a bug. if a developer ever reads this, it was when one of the npc's was craving a ""copper plate"" i had to have it physically on me to give in that case... or maybe i'm dumb and haven't realized that all gifts must be in inventory to give and that's just a feature. in other words you don't need to spend hours organizing your storage... just throw it in and call it a day (except for clothes you want to keep... that's worth putting in it's own storage... everything else? who cares?)

relic hunting... is more exciting... maybe some won't like the change but i especially love it. instead of a giant cube room it's multiple floors of some building or something, and there are specific items you can get per floor. it makes it less of a ""find one of 50 relics which each have 2-7 pieces in this one giant room! didn't find them? well then do it all over again!"" now it's more like 5 relics per floor in a designed building that has multiple floors and start from whichever floor you want so long as you've gone deep enough to find the entrance to that floor. huge improvement in my book.

combat... i can't say about all the weapons... i started with the daggers tried, the others once, i love the daggers.... call me thorfin. 

combat is pretty similar to the old game, but just better. from armor breaking/staggering, to varying stats on the same item because of it's quality, which can range from low, to perfect, and then there's rare, which adds some cool features.... whether it's crafting, buying or finding. the items are all much more exciting in this game.

i was disappointed.... that everything feels mostly the same as the original game, but happy it's better. you're basically getting the same game but part two. 

the dialogue is mostly skipable, with the occasional choose your response, in which cases i regret not reading the dialogue... buuuut 95% of the time... totally skipable. unless i'm in a reading mood, i find it average, and occasionally good.

cut scenes.... are extremely lacking... it's like a low quality first time actor playing a major roll in a lead film, and the director says after each scene, ""cut.. that's a wrap... send it to production."" when they should've said, ""cut! that sucks! what are you doing! you're entering a scene where all the monsters are already gone, you've just barely shown up, and then you do a front roll into the room... from the middle of the room... you then aim your pistol, stand up, smile doing a finger spin with the pistol... catch it, blow the smoke off the tip of the pistol, when there is no smoke, because you haven't fired a single shot?... are you stupid? did you take acting lessons from stupid school? did you graduate top of your stupid class with stupid honors? because that was pretty stupid!""

now if they added a character to come in and say those exact words to that silly dude who did all those things... then it would've been hilarious, and we all would've understood... that's the stupid guy... but no, every cut scene is pretty much like that.

i love the game... plenty to make fun of, and critique, but that doesn't stop me from loving it. leave a comment/question if you have any specific inquiries.

dlc worth it?..... you aren't missing anything by not buying any of the dlc items... sure they'll give you a nice head start, but even though i had them i found myself not using any of them because i like starting a game with nothing and then building up to something awesome. if you're the same, save yourself a few bucks, otherwise if you just want some gear for some different looks, then maybe you'll like it.

character creation.... well at least you won't look like you have down syndrome in the game... unless that's what you're going for i'm sure you can pull it off!!! there is a major improvement on the quality of character in the creation tab... but i just want more!!! 

you really don't have a lot of options, and they don't leave you thinking, ""that character i made looks so bad a!!!"" it's more of a, ""well... i guess that's as good as it gets."" i liked how mine turned out, but it took 3 hours of messing around with every possibility, starting and deleting 3 games (the character never looks exactly the same in the game play)...before i finally got to ""my guy looks really kind of okay!""

(example... i put lipstic and changed the coloring on my guy to make him look like he had actual lips... not feminine lips... just dude lips... i get into the game... feminine af! deleted, and then did the same thing except made the lipstick lighter than what looked good... in the gameplay it looked pretty good. i mean.....i'm the equivalent of brad freaking pitt in this character creation screen! i look so good! kindof... joking aside i was happy with the final result. i can't say whether it's the same for making a girl since i didn't try.)

2023-11-12,"[h1] my time at sandrock: an amazingly massive game, a great story line, and some occasional faults. ~ [/h1]

[h3] okay, so i have obviously played this game a lot, and it's because it is that good! if you're a return player from portia, i can confirm to you that sandrock is a massive upgrade in almost all aspects! if you have never played a game in the my time at series, don't worry! you absolutely do not have to play portia to enjoy sandrock! after over 200 hours of game play, here's my major takeaways ~ [/h3]

[u] the great ~ [/u] 

[b] the story line [/b]
- sandrock has a really great main story quest line, with enough twist and turns to keep you interested and immersed. it truly was a pleasure to play through it! there's a good mix of resource gathering, social aspects, combat, farming, and advancement required that keeps you motivated to continue grinding towards completion. also, if you're a return player from portia, i personally believe that sandrock has a better story line, and has increased difficulty.
[b] the characters [/b]
- wow! sandrock truly has some very colorful characters! without giving anything away, these side characters have a variety of personalities that are genuinely fun to interact with. in a lot of other games from this genre i tend to stop talking to a lot of the npcs around town, but i actually like hearing what the characters in sandrock have to say! it also helps that every character is given new unique dialogue after progress in the story is made, so they're not just constantly spouting the same lines all the time, regardless of development. there's a lot of great romance options as well, with there being someone for everyone. 
[b] the dialogue [/b]
- there's no other way to say this ~ this game just has straight up hilarious lines! from a farmer who's a part-time conspiracy theorist to a rock obsessed wannabe deputy, there's no shortage of great lines from the characters around the game. the dialogue also makes you want to befriend more of the citizens to see their extra events because of how hilarious they can be. your player character can even give some golden one-liners as the game progresses! 
[b] the grind [/b] 
- you really have to get involved in all aspects of the game when playing. you're going to need a lot of wood to complete projects, i mean, you are a builder. however, sandrock is desolate and cutting down trees and cacti is a big no-no. this means you have to cut down tiny bushes, dead logs, etc. which do not give you a lot of resources, meaning you've got to keep at the grind! also, as you unlock more areas and more of the story, you find yourself having to go back to previous ruins/areas in order to get different types of materials, as they're not in the same place. don't forget that water powers all of your machines, so you have to keep your tank full in the middle of the desert! 

[u] the lacking~ [/u]

[b] the family issue [/b]
- in short, because there's so many elements in sandrock, they eventually fizzle out in unsatisfactory ways. a good example can be seen with married and family life, which is just not fleshed out enough. considering characters around the game continuously sing praises towards your character, and comment on the various things going on around, it's strange that basically nobody acknowledges your spouse and children. so far, there's no family events, and once your children exit the baby stage, you literally never see them interact with anyone, including your spouse. they wake up and essentially go to one place (the train station) for the entire day.  it would've been nice to have them as actual members of the town, with their own events as they age, and a routine that mimics other npcs. as for your spouse, the married events currently in game are very boring and out of place for some characters. i would really love to see married life and family life be more fleshed out in the future, whether in another my time game, or in an expansion/update! i would rather have less romance options and just one child if that means that the additional content that comes with them would be stronger. 
[b] character favoritism + strange depth [/b]
- it's very obvious that, because of fan reception, some characters are more favored than others. by this i mean that they have way more content. take fang and logan as an example. both characters are fan favorites, and they have some really cool events! these events also work really well with what has been presented with their characters, which gives not only their characters, but the game, more depth. it really makes you believe that they had a life before you, and have a life despite you. i suppose this makes me more critical of the other characters in the game. director qi is a good example of this. you actually get to know so much about his character! for example, he's the grandson of a successful scientist who appears to be very strict, his parent's had more ""lowly"" jobs in comparison and qi appears to sort of look down on them, and he even states that his parents were shocked to find out that you exist (if you romance him), and that when he was younger he calculated that there was only a 3.14% chance of him finding love. these all combine to create such an interesting character, and gives you a plethora of ideas of how his character will/can progress. however, despite these tidbits that you can gather, that's basically it. his character, as well as a large portion of characters in the game, plateau. this is what i mean about strange depth, it's like they had more planned for certain characters, and it just never came to fruition. i was so certain when romancing qi's character that there was going to be some really cool events regarding his past, him falling in love with you, having children of his own, etc., and it just never happened. it honestly was a big disappointment because i saw all the makings of a great side story for a lot of the romance-able characters, but it's just not there. 

[h3] in conclusion, i honestly feel like i have so much more to say, which isn't surprising considering how much i loved the game. additionally, i would say that because i love the game and series so much i am probably more critical of it in certain ways! i think that's truly the hallmark sign of a great game, liking it so much that you want to make certain changes to perfect it! all in all, sandrock was truly an amazing experience and i would recommend it to all lovers of the genre. however, keep in mind that there are going to be aspects of the game that will leave you frustrated. these frustrations, at least for me, have a lot to do with the fact that i just want more! keep it up devs! you're doing great sweeties, and the improvement from portia is massive!

2023-11-11,"overall, i recommend the game - 480 hours played across early release - but that doesn't mean the game is perfect. much has been made of the voiceover issues with this game, so i'll bypass those, other than to add that changing the voiceover artist for later updates compounded the issue.

it's less clunky (although arguable less realistic, as a consequence) than its predecessor, my time at portia, which may make for a less than satisfying experience for anyone who chooses to play that game after this one. the characters in sandrock are less bobble-headed, too, which is an improvement. portia and sandrock happen in a simultaneous timelime, which leads to some quietly-amusing references to, effectively, your portia character at points during sandrock, another reason to consider playing portia first.

of the five bachelors i romanced, three of them exhibited behaviour that, in real life, should set major alarm bells ringing, which is quite concerning. a couple of the npcs are genuinely unlikeable, which is fine and reflective of real life; but i found myself resenting completing lucrative contracts for one of them by late game, as their relationship with me continued to increase even as my loathing of them grew.

as i did play this through early release, some things may have changed by full release, but a few niggly annoyances stood out: at times, lucrative commissions for machinery would appear on the commission board; but without having any in-game ability to know what was required to complete construction, it was quite frustrating to accept these commissions, research the manufacturing plans, discover you needed more advanced equipment yourself, research that, then find that you needed components you either didn't have materials for, or didn't have the ability to make. in one instance, the 'base' instructions for making the refined material i needed to make one component didn't even become available until nearly two months after i'd failed the commission. if the capacity to complete the commission doesn't exist, don't make it available.

secondly, there were times when it became impossible to complete tasks because the final act clashed with some other event. some of these may have since been resolved. in a related annoyance, there are times when the pc wakes up with awareness of events it is literally impossible for them to have any knowledge of. often this is minor: calendar events added on rising in the morning that are explained when mail is read. occasionally, however, these are quite significant. just as bed, there are some events involving npcs that clearly acknowledge the passage of a significant period of time (a minimum two weeks would be essential in one case), yet those events conclude within a day or so. then there is the issue of being 'transported' to major events when you get up. on one occasion, running back home after such an event, i encountered a minor task simply by talking with an npc that i had no means of answering because the task was outlined in a letter i hadn't yet had a chance to read. more concerningly, the non-committal answer i gave may have broken the character, who never moved from the spot i encountered him for the remainder of the game, unless needed elsewhere.

the nanny-nag that says ""you can't use that possibly rude word!"" when naming things in single-player is both ludicrous and offensive: i'm an adult, not six years old, and i can make my own decisions. if it's important that any vaguely-implied rudeness must be leapt on with extreme prejudice, then i would suggest that eliminating toxic behaviours from a multitude of npcs would be a better use of censorship - especially if (and i am forced to assume that this must be the case) the game makers are trying to avoid corrupting sweet childish innocence.

similarly, an in-game swimwear fashion show basically designed to sell dlcs is both sexist and cowardly in dressing the female models in bikins and the males in shorts. the game designers may have jumped on the 'it's okay to be gay"" bandwagon; but their moral code is severely lacking in other areas (most particularly regarding toxic behaviours).

one in-game shop has a link to actual character figurines on amazon: if you follow the link you find that you're being asked to pay an offensively-large amount of money for a blind-box figurine, so that's a definitive 'no' on both counts. still, that annoyance is easily-avoided, although it does make me less-inclined to consider buying other pathea games products, up to and including dlcs, so they may like to rethink their approach.

yes, i have concentrated on the negatives in this review. on the positive side, the game is immensely-playable. for an obsessive such as me, there is always something to do, with the essential wait-times scattered throughout the game usually not too much of a trial. some npcs are clearly on the autism spectrum, and this is treated respectfully (albeit occasionally with not-unreasonable impatience) by other npcs and player choices, which is to be commended. apart from some built-in sexism, the character design is generally appealing, and the capacity to 'hide the hat' via the settings is appreciated: having put a lot of effort into designing my character, i like being able to see them. the storylines are often engaging, although i wish the character-based relationship-building tasks had a time expiry if unselected, because having them sit constantly on the map when i have no interest in following them through is annoying.

in summary, an enjoyable, very playable game with a number of flaws, some of them significant.",18231,Recommend Game 480 Hours Played Release Game Perfect Voiceover Issues Game Bypass Add Changing Voiceover Artist Updates Compounded Issue Clunky Arguable Realistic Consequence Predecessor Time Portia Satisfying Experience Chooses Play Game Characters Sandrock Bobble Headed Improvement Portia Sandrock Happen Simultaneous Timelime Leads Quietly Amusing References Effectively Portia Character Sandrock Reason Playing Portia Bachelors Romanced Exhibited Behaviour Real Life Set Major Alarm Bells Ringing Couple Npcs Genuinely Unlikeable Fine Reflective Real Life Resenting Completing Lucrative Contracts Late Game Relationship Continued Increase Loathing Grew Play Release Changed Release Niggly Annoyances Stood Times Lucrative Commissions Machinery Commission Board Game Ability Required Complete Construction Frustrating Accept Commissions Manufacturing Plans Discover Advanced Equipment Components Materials Ability Instance Base Instructions Refined Material Component Months Failed Commission Capacity Complete Commission Exist Times Impossible Complete Tasks Final Clashed Event Resolved Annoyance Times Pc Wakes Awareness Events Literally Impossible Knowledge Minor Calendar Events Rising Morning Explained Mail Read Occasionally Bed Events Involving Npcs Acknowledge Passage Period Time Minimum Weeks Essential Events Conclude Day Issue Transported Major Events Occasion Running Event Encountered Minor Task Simply Talking Npc Answering Task Outlined Letter Chance Read Concerningly Committal Answer Broken Character Moved Spot Encountered Remainder Game Nanny Nag Rude Word Naming Single Player Ludicrous Offensive Adult Decisions Vaguely Implied Rudeness Leapt Extreme Prejudice Eliminating Toxic Behaviours Multitude Npcs Censorship Forced Assume Game Makers Avoid Corrupting Sweet Childish Innocence Game Swimwear Fashion Basically Designed Sell Dlcs Sexist Cowardly Dressing Female Models Bikins Males Shorts Game Designers Jumped Gay Bandwagon Moral Code Severely Lacking Toxic Behaviours Game Shop Link Actual Character Figurines Amazon Follow Link Pay Offensively Money Blind Box Figurine Definitive Counts Annoyance Easily Avoided Inclined Buying Pathea Games Products Including Dlcs Rethink Approach Concentrated Negatives Review Positive Game Immensely Playable Obsessive Essential Wait Times Scattered Game Trial Npcs Autism Spectrum Treated Respectfully Albeit Occasionally Unreasonable Impatience Npcs Player Choices Commended Built Sexism Character Design Appealing Capacity Hide Hat Settings Appreciated Lot Effort Designing Character Storylines Engaging Character Based Relationship Building Tasks Time Expiry Unselected Sit Constantly Map Annoying Summary Enjoyable Playable Game Flaws,POSITIVE,1,0,53,15,0.7794117647058824
2023-11-11,"having played portia, and having played this a bit while in ea, i can definitively say that this is a straight upgrade in many ways compared to the previous game and that time spent in ea was well spent to make a generally well-polished experience on release. 

the thing that stood out to me as vastly improved in comparison to portia is the combat, which, for a game that has utilized this mechanic in a more intimate way that other farming/building/life simulation games, i think really nails the good balance in necessity to being enjoyable to engage with. especially when you start upgrading the combat skills, getting more combos, getting the flow of the enemy actions and dodging and timing strikes, while not particularly profound, still feels enjoyable and far more engaging than the previous games and others in the same genre i've experienced. it feels simple enough though that even if you're not really playing this game to partake in the combat-portion of the game, it's easy enough to out-level the enemies by performing other tasks that simple button mashing to get the mats you need from lower level monsters won't pose much of an obstacle.

outside of combat, i've always enjoyed the commission system in both games, and i think it serves well here for giving yourself a sense of progression and direction. while being rewarding enough that, while being somewhat repetitive in what you'll be building for the various residents of sandrock, serves more as the foundation for pursuing other enjoyable ventures like upgrading your workshop, buying mats that you need either directly at stores or commissioning deliveries while giving you enough of a reward in not only the money you need, but additional materials and easy relationship improvements outside of the, arguably, rather shallow and repetitive npc conversational engagements quickly enough to give you variety in other things to do without feeling like too much of a grind.

the story is also rather cute, if not a bit on the simple side, which imo, is fine for what it is - it gives you a further sense of purpose and a meaningful way to progress unlockable areas, residents, and mechanics. i feel several of the npcs have notable quirks that make them memorable enough to want to engage with them and their missions, although at times, even with the characters that are not designed to be long-winded (like cooper), i found myself wanting to read the dialog faster than i wanted to hear it from them because there's just something about the way they talk and the flow that just made me frequently want to skip it. can't really put my finger on why exactly, but this was especially true when interacting with them daily during the regular chat interactions. with that said though, one really nice touch is how npcs all have their own individual reactions to story events that are enjoyable to listen to, even if they can be a bit long-winded sometimes. it's a nice touch to detail that somewhat makes your accomplishments in the game feel more relevant to your place in the world.

lastly, while i haven't played much of it since ea, the multiplayer seems way more polished (and was non-existent in the previous game) and has been pretty fun so far. if you've got friends to play with, while it's completely separate from the base instance of the game, the co-op workspace and co-op commissions and being able to engage in spelunking and combat with friends gives it a fresh feel from the base, single-player, portion of the game.

[h3][u]tl:dr[/u][/h3]
- solid improvement from the previous game in almost every way.
- combat improvements especially feel much better from previous games.
- story is fine, albeit a bit on the simple side. more focus made on the mechanics.
- many npcs are memorable in their own way if not a bit long-winded and the base chat mechanic is a bit bleh but the ""play"" mechanics make up for it a bit (albeit, get a bit repetitive with the limited options and expensive energy costs to engage in them). 
- multiplayer is a separate instance from the base, single-player, game, but having all the same mechanics being applied while playing with friends has, so far, been a very enjoyable experience and is way more polished than when it was introduced in ea.",18231,Played Portia Played Bit Ea Definitively Straight Upgrade Compared Previous Game Time Spent Ea Spent Polished Experience Release Stood Vastly Improved Comparison Portia Combat Game Utilized Mechanic Intimate Farming Building Life Simulation Games Nails Balance Necessity Enjoyable Engage Start Upgrading Combat Skills Combos Flow Enemy Actions Dodging Timing Strikes Profound Feels Enjoyable Engaging Previous Games Genre Experienced Feels Simple Playing Game Partake Combat Portion Game Easy Level Enemies Performing Tasks Simple Button Mashing Mats Level Monsters Pose Obstacle Combat Enjoyed Commission Games Serves Sense Progression Direction Rewarding Repetitive Building Residents Sandrock Serves Foundation Pursuing Enjoyable Ventures Upgrading Workshop Buying Mats Stores Commissioning Deliveries Reward Money Additional Materials Easy Relationship Improvements Arguably Shallow Repetitive Npc Conversational Engagements Variety Feeling Grind Story Cute Bit Simple Imo Fine Sense Purpose Meaningful Progress Unlockable Residents Mechanics Feel Npcs Notable Quirks Memorable Engage Missions Times Characters Designed Winded Cooper Read Dialog Faster Hear Talk Flow Frequently Skip Finger True Interacting Daily Regular Chat Interactions Nice Touch Npcs Individual Reactions Story Events Enjoyable Listen Bit Winded Nice Touch Accomplishments Game Feel Relevant Lastly Played Ea Multiplayer Polished Existent Previous Game Pretty Fun Friends Play Completely Separate Base Instance Game Op Workspace Op Commissions Engage Spelunking Combat Friends Fresh Feel Base Single Player Portion Game H3 Tl Dr H3 Solid Improvement Previous Game Combat Improvements Feel Previous Games Story Fine Albeit Bit Simple Focus Mechanics Npcs Memorable Bit Winded Base Chat Mechanic Bit Bleh Play Mechanics Bit Albeit Bit Repetitive Limited Options Expensive Energy Costs Engage Multiplayer Separate Instance Base Single Player Game Mechanics Applied Playing Friends Enjoyable Experience Polished Introduced Ea,POSITIVE,1,0,53,15,0.7794117647058824

2023-11-16,"under 30 hours of game play, but i can confidently say this is my new go-to game. i sort of liked my time at portia ... i mean, it was ok. but sandrock is something else entirely! there's so much to do you'll never feel bored - every day there are new quests (at least 4) that you can chose - or not, on top of game progressing quests and commissions (side jobs to make money). like i said, you'll never be bored. 

the relationships are easy to maintain. i always find, in other similar games, it can take a while to gain friendships, but i guess everyone in sandrock is just really friendly, lol. plenty of good romantic partners to choose from - i think i'm going to need at least 5 saves to marry different villagers. you can take your friends on hang outs and participate in a few activities (like playing at the game centre or chatting by the oasis to learn more about them). this is a really neat feature, and i can honestly say i don't know if portia was the same or similar because i simply didn't make it that far, lol. if you chose to date someone, you can do different activities with them as well, and even hug and kiss them when you  want to (so cute).

2023-11-01,"i talked to a phone booth in the game that told me to leave a review with feedback, so i'm gonna do that!

this game's totally worth the asking price as-is, really elevates the farm life genre beyond stardew valley in pretty much every way (i loved stardew!), and offers a scintillating post-apocalyptic desert setting that feels really novel.

this game clearly has a lot to say about the way capital and a self-serving government can funnel money to prop up those who are already successful whilst leaving struggling communities to languish. there are tons of quests and side quests where characters ask if you can spot them money because the economy in sandrock is awful, and public servants will frequently lament the difficulty the town has getting government grants and the belief the residents should 'just move somewhere nicer' without regard for the town's unique culture or the financial hurdles one must jump over to be able to afford moving.

i'm still not done with the game's main story line even 80 hours in, but i'm excited to see how it further develops arguments between characters about the potential perils of technological advancement, because it seems like the game's religious faction is on the verge of lashing out at sandrock's local government for making use of scientific advancements to try and make the desert environment more habitable.

the game's premise also allows it to offer critique on world politics and modern society from the perspective of characters who are discovering information about us hundreds of years in the future. in the 'my time at' series' lore, to really simplify it, technology progressed with little oversight or regulation which made it trivially easy to start a world war that decimated most (all?) of the planet's surface and plunged the world into a new dark age, with people living underground until they were able to return to the surface and rebuild on top of the ruins.

i was surprised by the way this game tackles criticisms of the genre as being centered on mindless extractivism; the rationing of water from the local supply is a serious gameplay factory to account for, the logistical challenges of importing water from other towns is discussed frequently, and you're told as soon as you start the game that logging is illegal due to how few trees there are. plus there's a serious focus on scavenging for scraps and re-purposing those into materials.

this game really surprised me; i had kind of written it off because i thought the art style was a touch off-putting, but the narrative, character writing, and gameplay loops have all charmed and hooked me.

now, because that phone booth said the developers read reviews of the game for feedback, here's some very specific complaints i'd like addressed:

1. i'm in the summer of year two, partway through the bronco the kid quests, and i keep getting building commissions for items i cannot complete because i haven't met musa yet, which means i haven't gained access to the areas that unlock when he shows up in town. some of the commissions i've seen posted but can't complete are industrial machine tools, the advanced civil processor, and chromium daggers. i have these recipes already because i've been diligent about doing machine research with qi and buying recipes from the commerce guild, but i think the game should check to see whether the player has the ability to get the materials necessary to make something before it pops up as a commission.

2. after you first get the chance to express romantic interest in elsie, there's a line of dialogue where she declares 'i'm a legal adult' in frustration at the way her parents treat her. i appreciate the effort to make it clear she's not too young to ethically date, but she's very childish, and that line just makes her sound more childish. the mention of legality feels like a reassurance to the player, which doesn't make for good character dialog.

3. at some point, jumping with my camel started causing the game to freeze in the air for a half-second, after which it hits the ground and all four hoof-hitting-ground sounds play one right after the other. i swear the jumping animation used to be way smoother without that hitch and without the weird sound; i don't have performance issues in this game, so it's not lag as far as i can tell.

4. sometimes machines will get stuck saying they need to have the sand cleaned out of them, and no matter how many different positions or angles i try i cannot see a sand pile to remove with my duster. i found that picking the machine up and putting it back down fixes it temporarily, but i would prefer to just not have that issue, it's annoying having to finesse the position of a civil furnace that sits between two other furnaces.

5. i need storage to be sortable across all boxes instead of the 'sort' option just sorting that individual storage box, as well as the ability to search for an item in storage by name. i would also like for storage to always be accessible when you're gifting a character something. it's frustrating going through my 10? 12? large storage boxes, each with two pages of items to scroll through, especially since item names are only visible by using the left stick and going over every item.

6. finding relic parts for qi's side quests is too time consuming. i would prefer the quest-necessary relic pieces be located in chests in the ruins rather than in the dirt; i haven't found the scanner particularly effective at locating the quest pieces, so i've just been hitting every piece of dirt i can find on every floor hoping to uncover a relic piece eventually, which is extremely tedious when i also really need to move on to a new floor for the ores so i have the materials to complete my commissions.

7. the lack of tin scrap makes bronze more difficult to craft than stuff like chromium or manganese steel, and i'm not sure why that's the case given bronze is required for crafting so many different things.

8. there should be an option to turn on alerts for commissions that are going to expire that day. even if you're tracking your commissions that are due the soonest, you won't see when the commission expires on the main screen.

9. the shop interface should tell you whether clothing/accessories are better or worse than your current gear; i can't really compare my gear when it's all named something like 'stunt rider desert warrior visor' or 'bright defense team boots' since those names don't convey anything about their stats. it's also a struggle to remember my shirt provides, for example, '+136 health + 17 stamina +5% critical hit chance + negates poison status effects' when i'm in a shop going through a bunch of different shirts all with different stat buffs and effects.

10. add a setting that lets run be set as the default movement speed, please. using the 'toggle' doesn't work because there a bunch of annoying circumstances where the game toggles the player back to walking.

11. it's pretty easy to get stuck on obstacles in the sandrunning competition, and i lost a race because i got stuck under a boost pad ramp after hitting it from the side and had to forfeit to get out.

all of that said though, it's a great game, i'm looking forward to getting through the main story so i can go try my time at portia after this!",2157,Talked Phone Booth Game Told Leave Review Feedback Gonna Game Totally Worth Price Elevates Farm Life Genre Stardew Valley Pretty Loved Stardew Offers Scintillating Post Apocalyptic Desert Setting Feels Game Lot Capital Serving Government Funnel Money Prop Successful Leaving Struggling Communities Languish Tons Quests Quests Characters Spot Money Economy Sandrock Awful Public Servants Frequently Lament Difficulty Town Government Grants Belief Residents Nicer Regard Town Unique Culture Financial Hurdles Jump Afford Moving Game Main Story 80 Hours Excited Develops Arguments Characters Potential Perils Technological Advancement Game Religious Faction Verge Lashing Sandrock Local Government Scientific Advancements Desert Environment Habitable Game Premise Offer Critique Politics Modern Society Perspective Characters Discovering Hundreds Future Time Series Lore Simplify Technology Progressed Oversight Regulation Trivially Easy Start War Decimated Planet Surface Plunged Dark Age People Living Underground Return Surface Rebuild Ruins Surprised Game Tackles Criticisms Genre Centered Mindless Extractivism Rationing Water Local Supply Gameplay Factory Account Logistical Challenges Importing Water Towns Discussed Frequently Told Start Game Logging Illegal Trees Focus Scavenging Scraps Purposing Materials Game Surprised Written Art Style Touch Putting Narrative Character Writing Gameplay Loops Charmed Hooked Phone Booth Developers Read Reviews Game Feedback Specific Complaints Addressed 1 Summer Partway Bronco Kid Quests Building Commissions Items Complete Met Musa Gained Access Unlock Town Commissions Posted Complete Industrial Machine Tools Advanced Civil Processor Chromium Daggers Recipes Diligent Machine Qi Buying Recipes Commerce Guild Game Check Player Ability Materials Pops Commission 2 Chance Express Romantic Elsie Dialogue Declares Legal Adult Frustration Parents Treat Effort Ethically Childish Sound Childish Mention Legality Feels Reassurance Player Character Dialog 3 Jumping Camel Started Causing Game Freeze Air Hits Ground Hoof Hitting Ground Sounds Play Swear Jumping Animation Smoother Hitch Weird Sound Performance Issues Game Lag 4 Machines Stuck Sand Cleaned Matter Positions Angles Sand Pile Remove Duster Picking Machine Putting Fixes Temporarily Prefer Issue Annoying Finesse Position Civil Furnace Sits Furnaces 5 Storage Sortable Boxes Sort Option Sorting Individual Storage Box Ability Search Item Storage Storage Accessible Gifting Character Frustrating 12 Storage Boxes Items Scroll Item Names Visible Left Stick Item 6 Finding Relic Qi Quests Time Consuming Prefer Quest Relic Pieces Located Chests Ruins Dirt Scanner Effective Locating Quest Pieces Hitting Piece Dirt Floor Hoping Uncover Relic Piece Eventually Extremely Tedious Floor Ores Materials Complete Commissions 7 Lack Tin Scrap Bronze Difficult Craft Stuff Chromium Manganese Steel Bronze Required Crafting 8 Option Alerts Commissions Expire Day Tracking Commissions Soonest Commission Expires Main Screen 9 Shop Interface Clothing Accessories Worse Current Gear Compare Gear Named Stunt Rider Desert Warrior Visor Bright Defense Team Boots Names Convey Stats Struggle Remember Shirt 136 Health 17 Stamina 5 Critical Hit Chance Negates Poison Status Effects Shop Bunch Shirts Stat Buffs Effects Add Setting Set Default Movement Speed Toggle Bunch Annoying Circumstances Game Toggles Player Walking 11 Pretty Easy Stuck Obstacles Sandrunning Competition Lost Race Stuck Boost Pad Ramp Hitting Forfeit Game Main Story Time Portia,POSITIVE,1,0,17,0,1.0

2023-11-26,"this is really more of a neutral review.  the game does a lot right, but it has a major flaw that really need to be addressed if they make another ""my time..."" game.  

the world is way too constrained by the story.  it acts like an open world game, but plays like a linear one.  there are invisible walls all over the place, which make exploring frustrating.  these walls are in both the actual invisible wall form (where you just can't move in a direction for no other reason than the game not allowing you to), to story elements that don't let you progress (which i have less of an issue with but could still be a lot better).

why not open up the world and have the progression mechanics define your limits?  these mechanics are already in place.  i can't mine/cut things without a certain level of tool.  i can't really defeat high level enemies without being closer to their level.  so let me explore and run into those limits, don't just put walls everywhere and then have the story open it up.  it feels like they didn't trust the player to be able to play the game and they wanted to really hold your hand by limiting what you could interact with.  this made the game feel like it was unnecessarily on rails.

this point grated on me the entire game, and i kept getting frustrated by not being able to explore.  by the mid/end game i just followed the story and stopped even trying to explore.  which is really a shame.

that point aside, the game is solid and if you enjoyed portia you will probably enjoy this.  i don't remember the same constrained feeling from portia, but that could be my faulty memory.",9102,Neutral Review Game Lot Major Flaw Addressed Time Game Constrained Story Acts Game Plays Linear Invisible Walls Exploring Frustrating Walls Actual Invisible Wall Form Direction Reason Game Allowing Story Elements Progress Issue Lot Progression Mechanics Define Limits Mechanics Cut Level Tool Defeat Level Enemies Closer Level Explore Limits Walls Story Feels Trust Player Play Game Hold Hand Limiting Interact Game Feel Unnecessarily Rails Grated Entire Game Frustrated Explore Mid Game Story Stopped Explore Shame Game Solid Enjoyed Portia Enjoy Remember Constrained Feeling Portia Faulty Memory,POSITIVE,1,0,76,10,0.8837209302325582

list of bugs i encountered throughout playing:
- characters get stuck into each other trying to exit a building
- you can climb along the cliff when you get to the ""mama tree"" and fall down the other side of the cliff of the desert and get stuck
- ""into the abyss"" mission you get a slow debuff that says 0sec duration but remains throughout the mission so i just spam roll everywhere.
- in the next dungeon after i had a slow and poison debuff of 0 sec that was permanent until i died and reloaded.
- once or twice loading screen didnt work when entering the house so i lost 20-30mins of progress (autosaves saved the day)
- everyone gets handed a medal but mc does a t-pose when receiving the medal
- mc becomes semi/fully transparent/invisible when mounting a horse and then briefly when dismounting.
- mounts and npcs constantly teleport to get to where they need to go so u have to ""catch them"" via dialogue before they fade with the wind.
- married amirah and her bd party is during one of the festivals so she didnt even attend her own party
- built the sand buggy on the assembly station and it was literally invisible
- was outside the house and my pet was stuck in the walls of my house
- bumble ants like to walk into the walls of my property (bad pathing)
- there are two enemies that no longer spawn due to game progression but civil commissions are still posted asking you to wipe them out.
- there were a couple instances where commissions are posted asking you to create an item using resources that are farmed in an area you dont have access to yet.

list of stuff i didnt like:
- too many relic pieces and i didnt want to spend the time looking/sorting through each storage box to find the duplicates so i would make multiple storage boxes which would have the same duplicate in multiple boxes
- max backpack space is a lot, but was still maxing it out more often than i wanted to as there are items (like gifts) i always kept on hand
- to 100% steam achievements in a reasonable time you need to talk and gift everyone from day 1 as social exp is a big grind otherwise
- weapon perks are unbalanced; why pick a 10% slow/burn/poison chance on hit when u can just go raw crit build with crit dmg, crit chance and lifedrain
- cant keep track of items donated to the museum unless you manually track it on spreadsheet (see guide in forums)
- when npc's steal your kill, you dont have that enemy registered to the bestiary, so if that enemy is a boss enemy that only spawns once, glhf. you also get no exp
- npc's run as fast as a slow horse, but you're stuck with the same runspeed throughout the game (exception is temporary buff in dungeon).
- read in forums automation doesnt give you workshop exp
- animals seemed like an afterthought since those buildings are maxed at lv 1, otherwise is a decent choice for extra side income
- thrown items were meh, and you cant use them to mine ores
- hard to build relationship pts with kids or animals since they dont post commissions so with animals you can only talk and gift once a day, (with kids you can also play critters)
- non essential npc's have nothing better to say other than ""...""
- va for musa is also a soldier.

things i did like:
- items from storage can be used to turn in items for quests
- good variety of characters/memorable personalities, but then there's people like jensen who has no backstory
- get to see how your projects build sandrock up, enjoyed the story and how it related to the last game
- ranged weapons are a pretty cheesy way of beating combat content 
- melee combat was good for a game not focused on combat
- enough perks to make more gol, make friends faster, make stuff faster, etc
- steam achievements are not difficult to achieve, but some are somewhat grindy unless you plan ahead. i think roughly 140hrs until i get 100%.
- you can go to options menu to speed up or slow down the game at leisure 0.6-3x so waiting for time related events doesnt take forever.

2023-11-26,"overall impression: 4.3 out of 5. a great follow-up to my time in portia that improves on its key formulas. however, it takes steps backwards in a couple of areas in ways that are frustrating.

my time at sandrock is a huge step forward from my time at portia. the inventory system has been much improved. combat, while still basic, is more engaging. the story is much better. while there are still vast expanses of empty space outside of the town, it does not feel as lifeless as the wildernesses in my time at portia. the main quest line is also much more fleshed out and fun.

however, the later upgrades to your production tools are a pain to work with compared to what was available in my time at portia. the factory and greenhouse additions to your house are frankly horrible. they are not smooth to work with; they require fiddling with your house, which is no fun, and the system feels stuck on as an extra rather than a key functioning tool.

so much fun in single player, and even more fun with friends.

this game is definitely for the girlies. you can fall in love with a rogue bandit, a handsome and warm saloon owner, or even a mysterious doctor who barely speaks. oh and there's a nerd who collects rocks who may also have my heart :) 

the npcs feel very fleshed out, and all feel very unique and have their own personalities. i haven't even begun to touch the heart of the story (i'm still trying to nab logan!!!!) and i can't get enough.

i would recommend playing portia before sandrock so you can know the delight of the world, become familiar with the characters, and get a feel of how the game works. 

not a fan of microtransactions, but they're merely cosmetics so i can't complain too much (thank you for not locking quests behind a paywall)

2023-11-04,"this is a general improvement of portia, with numerous qol improvements and better graphics.  if you want a chill builder sim game with a side of combat, this is a decent pick up.  that said there's a few things from the original that haven't improved:

-the combat is still too simplistic.  there are still no special attacks (the enemies get them, but not the player) so all you do for the most part is mash lmb and roll dodge once in a while.  there are ranged weapons, but having to constantly build more ammo is annoying so you'll just melee everything for the most part.
-the main story drags on way too long.  this was probably my main complaint about portia as well.  as another reviewer put it, there's an interesting major plotline where you fully expect the story to end afterwards but it drags on with more mundane busywork for another 10-15 hours.
-waiting on things.  you can speed up time to 3x speed at least without mods, but it can still take 15+ minutes of real time to smelt a stack of bars so a lot of the time you'll just toss stuff in and end the day to skip time.
-relation grind.  like the first game it is slow and tedious.  some characters aren't too bad because they constantly put up commissions which give a big chunk for something you want to do anyways, or are heavily involved in story missions.  others, like the doctor, require you go out of your way to talk to and constantly do boring crap like play critters (basically rock paper scissors with cards) over and over.  as a bonus middle finger, [spoiler]several characters leave partway through main story and get replaced by new ones[/spoiler].  hope you didn't waste your time on those ones!

overall though, it's a decent game for the price.  i never finished portia, i tried twice and got bored halfway through both times.  sandrock at least improved the gameplay enough to make me finish it this time.",16806,Improvement Portia Numerous Qol Improvements Graphics Chill Builder Sim Game Combat Decent Pick Original Improved Combat Simplistic Special Attacks Enemies Player Mash Lmb Roll Dodge Ranged Weapons Constantly Build Ammo Annoying Melee Main Story Drags Main Complaint Portia Reviewer Major Plotline Expect Story Drags Mundane Busywork 15 Hours Waiting Speed Time 3X Speed Mods 15 Minutes Real Time Smelt Stack Bars Lot Time Toss Stuff Day Skip Time Relation Grind Game Slow Tedious Characters Bad Constantly Commissions Chunk Heavily Involved Story Missions Doctor Require Talk Constantly Boring Crap Play Critters Basically Rock Paper Scissors Cards Bonus Middle Finger Spoiler Characters Leave Partway Main Story Replaced Spoiler Hope Waste Time Decent Game Price Finished Portia Bored Halfway Times Sandrock Improved Gameplay Finish Time,POSITIVE,1,0,56,7,0.8888888888888888

2023-11-01,"i talked to a phone booth in the game that told me to leave a review with feedback, so i'm gonna do that!

this game's totally worth the asking price as-is, really elevates the farm life genre beyond stardew valley in pretty much every way (i loved stardew!), and offers a scintillating post-apocalyptic desert setting that feels really novel.

this game clearly has a lot to say about the way capital and a self-serving government can funnel money to prop up those who are already successful whilst leaving struggling communities to languish. there are tons of quests and side quests where characters ask if you can spot them money because the economy in sandrock is awful, and public servants will frequently lament the difficulty the town has getting government grants and the belief the residents should 'just move somewhere nicer' without regard for the town's unique culture or the financial hurdles one must jump over to be able to afford moving.

i'm still not done with the game's main story line even 80 hours in, but i'm excited to see how it further develops arguments between characters about the potential perils of technological advancement, because it seems like the game's religious faction is on the verge of lashing out at sandrock's local government for making use of scientific advancements to try and make the desert environment more habitable.

the game's premise also allows it to offer critique on world politics and modern society from the perspective of characters who are discovering information about us hundreds of years in the future. in the 'my time at' series' lore, to really simplify it, technology progressed with little oversight or regulation which made it trivially easy to start a world war that decimated most (all?) of the planet's surface and plunged the world into a new dark age, with people living underground until they were able to return to the surface and rebuild on top of the ruins.

i was surprised by the way this game tackles criticisms of the genre as being centered on mindless extractivism; the rationing of water from the local supply is a serious gameplay factory to account for, the logistical challenges of importing water from other towns is discussed frequently, and you're told as soon as you start the game that logging is illegal due to how few trees there are. plus there's a serious focus on scavenging for scraps and re-purposing those into materials.

this game really surprised me; i had kind of written it off because i thought the art style was a touch off-putting, but the narrative, character writing, and gameplay loops have all charmed and hooked me.

now, because that phone booth said the developers read reviews of the game for feedback, here's some very specific complaints i'd like addressed:

1. i'm in the summer of year two, partway through the bronco the kid quests, and i keep getting building commissions for items i cannot complete because i haven't met musa yet, which means i haven't gained access to the areas that unlock when he shows up in town. some of the commissions i've seen posted but can't complete are industrial machine tools, the advanced civil processor, and chromium daggers. i have these recipes already because i've been diligent about doing machine research with qi and buying recipes from the commerce guild, but i think the game should check to see whether the player has the ability to get the materials necessary to make something before it pops up as a commission.

2. after you first get the chance to express romantic interest in elsie, there's a line of dialogue where she declares 'i'm a legal adult' in frustration at the way her parents treat her. i appreciate the effort to make it clear she's not too young to ethically date, but she's very childish, and that line just makes her sound more childish. the mention of legality feels like a reassurance to the player, which doesn't make for good character dialog.

3. at some point, jumping with my camel started causing the game to freeze in the air for a half-second, after which it hits the ground and all four hoof-hitting-ground sounds play one right after the other. i swear the jumping animation used to be way smoother without that hitch and without the weird sound; i don't have performance issues in this game, so it's not lag as far as i can tell.

4. sometimes machines will get stuck saying they need to have the sand cleaned out of them, and no matter how many different positions or angles i try i cannot see a sand pile to remove with my duster. i found that picking the machine up and putting it back down fixes it temporarily, but i would prefer to just not have that issue, it's annoying having to finesse the position of a civil furnace that sits between two other furnaces.

5. i need storage to be sortable across all boxes instead of the 'sort' option just sorting that individual storage box, as well as the ability to search for an item in storage by name. i would also like for storage to always be accessible when you're gifting a character something. it's frustrating going through my 10? 12? large storage boxes, each with two pages of items to scroll through, especially since item names are only visible by using the left stick and going over every item.

6. finding relic parts for qi's side quests is too time consuming. i would prefer the quest-necessary relic pieces be located in chests in the ruins rather than in the dirt; i haven't found the scanner particularly effective at locating the quest pieces, so i've just been hitting every piece of dirt i can find on every floor hoping to uncover a relic piece eventually, which is extremely tedious when i also really need to move on to a new floor for the ores so i have the materials to complete my commissions.

7. the lack of tin scrap makes bronze more difficult to craft than stuff like chromium or manganese steel, and i'm not sure why that's the case given bronze is required for crafting so many different things.

8. there should be an option to turn on alerts for commissions that are going to expire that day. even if you're tracking your commissions that are due the soonest, you won't see when the commission expires on the main screen.

9. the shop interface should tell you whether clothing/accessories are better or worse than your current gear; i can't really compare my gear when it's all named something like 'stunt rider desert warrior visor' or 'bright defense team boots' since those names don't convey anything about their stats. it's also a struggle to remember my shirt provides, for example, '+136 health + 17 stamina +5% critical hit chance + negates poison status effects' when i'm in a shop going through a bunch of different shirts all with different stat buffs and effects.

10. add a setting that lets run be set as the default movement speed, please. using the 'toggle' doesn't work because there a bunch of annoying circumstances where the game toggles the player back to walking.

11. it's pretty easy to get stuck on obstacles in the sandrunning competition, and i lost a race because i got stuck under a boost pad ramp after hitting it from the side and had to forfeit to get out.

all of that said though, it's a great game, i'm looking forward to getting through the main story so i can go try my time at portia after this!",2157,Talked Phone Booth Game Told Leave Review Feedback Gonna Game Totally Worth Price Elevates Farm Life Genre Stardew Valley Pretty Loved Stardew Offers Scintillating Post Apocalyptic Desert Setting Feels Game Lot Capital Serving Government Funnel Money Prop Successful Leaving Struggling Communities Languish Tons Quests Quests Characters Spot Money Economy Sandrock Awful Public Servants Frequently Lament Difficulty Town Government Grants Belief Residents Nicer Regard Town Unique Culture Financial Hurdles Jump Afford Moving Game Main Story 80 Hours Excited Develops Arguments Characters Potential Perils Technological Advancement Game Religious Faction Verge Lashing Sandrock Local Government Scientific Advancements Desert Environment Habitable Game Premise Offer Critique Politics Modern Society Perspective Characters Discovering Hundreds Future Time Series Lore Simplify Technology Progressed Oversight Regulation Trivially Easy Start War Decimated Planet Surface Plunged Dark Age People Living Underground Return Surface Rebuild Ruins Surprised Game Tackles Criticisms Genre Centered Mindless Extractivism Rationing Water Local Supply Gameplay Factory Account Logistical Challenges Importing Water Towns Discussed Frequently Told Start Game Logging Illegal Trees Focus Scavenging Scraps Purposing Materials Game Surprised Written Art Style Touch Putting Narrative Character Writing Gameplay Loops Charmed Hooked Phone Booth Developers Read Reviews Game Feedback Specific Complaints Addressed 1 Summer Partway Bronco Kid Quests Building Commissions Items Complete Met Musa Gained Access Unlock Town Commissions Posted Complete Industrial Machine Tools Advanced Civil Processor Chromium Daggers Recipes Diligent Machine Qi Buying Recipes Commerce Guild Game Check Player Ability Materials Pops Commission 2 Chance Express Romantic Elsie Dialogue Declares Legal Adult Frustration Parents Treat Effort Ethically Childish Sound Childish Mention Legality Feels Reassurance Player Character Dialog 3 Jumping Camel Started Causing Game Freeze Air Hits Ground Hoof Hitting Ground Sounds Play Swear Jumping Animation Smoother Hitch Weird Sound Performance Issues Game Lag 4 Machines Stuck Sand Cleaned Matter Positions Angles Sand Pile Remove Duster Picking Machine Putting Fixes Temporarily Prefer Issue Annoying Finesse Position Civil Furnace Sits Furnaces 5 Storage Sortable Boxes Sort Option Sorting Individual Storage Box Ability Search Item Storage Storage Accessible Gifting Character Frustrating 12 Storage Boxes Items Scroll Item Names Visible Left Stick Item 6 Finding Relic Qi Quests Time Consuming Prefer Quest Relic Pieces Located Chests Ruins Dirt Scanner Effective Locating Quest Pieces Hitting Piece Dirt Floor Hoping Uncover Relic Piece Eventually Extremely Tedious Floor Ores Materials Complete Commissions 7 Lack Tin Scrap Bronze Difficult Craft Stuff Chromium Manganese Steel Bronze Required Crafting 8 Option Alerts Commissions Expire Day Tracking Commissions Soonest Commission Expires Main Screen 9 Shop Interface Clothing Accessories Worse Current Gear Compare Gear Named Stunt Rider Desert Warrior Visor Bright Defense Team Boots Names Convey Stats Struggle Remember Shirt 136 Health 17 Stamina 5 Critical Hit Chance Negates Poison Status Effects Shop Bunch Shirts Stat Buffs Effects Add Setting Set Default Movement Speed Toggle Bunch Annoying Circumstances Game Toggles Player Walking 11 Pretty Easy Stuck Obstacles Sandrunning Competition Lost Race Stuck Boost Pad Ramp Hitting Forfeit Game Main Story Time Portia,POSITIVE,1,0,17,0,1.0

so far there's only one point where i still have doubts and that is what is the replacement for the quest with the crane in order to be able to farm tin properly :d but i suspect that the error is more mine than the game :d but i'm open to any advice thankful :)

2023-11-12,"[h1] my time at sandrock: an amazingly massive game, a great story line, and some occasional faults. ~ [/h1]

[h3] okay, so i have obviously played this game a lot, and it's because it is that good! if you're a return player from portia, i can confirm to you that sandrock is a massive upgrade in almost all aspects! if you have never played a game in the my time at series, don't worry! you absolutely do not have to play portia to enjoy sandrock! after over 200 hours of game play, here's my major takeaways ~ [/h3]

[u] the great ~ [/u] 

[b] the story line [/b]
- sandrock has a really great main story quest line, with enough twist and turns to keep you interested and immersed. it truly was a pleasure to play through it! there's a good mix of resource gathering, social aspects, combat, farming, and advancement required that keeps you motivated to continue grinding towards completion. also, if you're a return player from portia, i personally believe that sandrock has a better story line, and has increased difficulty.
[b] the characters [/b]
- wow! sandrock truly has some very colorful characters! without giving anything away, these side characters have a variety of personalities that are genuinely fun to interact with. in a lot of other games from this genre i tend to stop talking to a lot of the npcs around town, but i actually like hearing what the characters in sandrock have to say! it also helps that every character is given new unique dialogue after progress in the story is made, so they're not just constantly spouting the same lines all the time, regardless of development. there's a lot of great romance options as well, with there being someone for everyone. 
[b] the dialogue [/b]
- there's no other way to say this ~ this game just has straight up hilarious lines! from a farmer who's a part-time conspiracy theorist to a rock obsessed wannabe deputy, there's no shortage of great lines from the characters around the game. the dialogue also makes you want to befriend more of the citizens to see their extra events because of how hilarious they can be. your player character can even give some golden one-liners as the game progresses! 
[b] the grind [/b] 
- you really have to get involved in all aspects of the game when playing. you're going to need a lot of wood to complete projects, i mean, you are a builder. however, sandrock is desolate and cutting down trees and cacti is a big no-no. this means you have to cut down tiny bushes, dead logs, etc. which do not give you a lot of resources, meaning you've got to keep at the grind! also, as you unlock more areas and more of the story, you find yourself having to go back to previous ruins/areas in order to get different types of materials, as they're not in the same place. don't forget that water powers all of your machines, so you have to keep your tank full in the middle of the desert! 

[u] the lacking~ [/u]

[b] the family issue [/b]
- in short, because there's so many elements in sandrock, they eventually fizzle out in unsatisfactory ways. a good example can be seen with married and family life, which is just not fleshed out enough. considering characters around the game continuously sing praises towards your character, and comment on the various things going on around, it's strange that basically nobody acknowledges your spouse and children. so far, there's no family events, and once your children exit the baby stage, you literally never see them interact with anyone, including your spouse. they wake up and essentially go to one place (the train station) for the entire day.  it would've been nice to have them as actual members of the town, with their own events as they age, and a routine that mimics other npcs. as for your spouse, the married events currently in game are very boring and out of place for some characters. i would really love to see married life and family life be more fleshed out in the future, whether in another my time game, or in an expansion/update! i would rather have less romance options and just one child if that means that the additional content that comes with them would be stronger. 
[b] character favoritism + strange depth [/b]
- it's very obvious that, because of fan reception, some characters are more favored than others. by this i mean that they have way more content. take fang and logan as an example. both characters are fan favorites, and they have some really cool events! these events also work really well with what has been presented with their characters, which gives not only their characters, but the game, more depth. it really makes you believe that they had a life before you, and have a life despite you. i suppose this makes me more critical of the other characters in the game. director qi is a good example of this. you actually get to know so much about his character! for example, he's the grandson of a successful scientist who appears to be very strict, his parent's had more ""lowly"" jobs in comparison and qi appears to sort of look down on them, and he even states that his parents were shocked to find out that you exist (if you romance him), and that when he was younger he calculated that there was only a 3.14% chance of him finding love. these all combine to create such an interesting character, and gives you a plethora of ideas of how his character will/can progress. however, despite these tidbits that you can gather, that's basically it. his character, as well as a large portion of characters in the game, plateau. this is what i mean about strange depth, it's like they had more planned for certain characters, and it just never came to fruition. i was so certain when romancing qi's character that there was going to be some really cool events regarding his past, him falling in love with you, having children of his own, etc., and it just never happened. it honestly was a big disappointment because i saw all the makings of a great side story for a lot of the romance-able characters, but it's just not there. 

[h3] in conclusion, i honestly feel like i have so much more to say, which isn't surprising considering how much i loved the game. additionally, i would say that because i love the game and series so much i am probably more critical of it in certain ways! i think that's truly the hallmark sign of a great game, liking it so much that you want to make certain changes to perfect it! all in all, sandrock was truly an amazing experience and i would recommend it to all lovers of the genre. however, keep in mind that there are going to be aspects of the game that will leave you frustrated. these frustrations, at least for me, have a lot to do with the fact that i just want more! keep it up devs! you're doing great sweeties, and the improvement from portia is massive!

2023-11-09,"please note that i am a kickstarter backer.

sandrock improves on portia by leaps and bounds. it takes the addicting loop of gathering resources to build machines to finish projects to build better machines to work with other resources and wraps it in a cozy blanket of interesting npcs and a deep setting. 

this is not a farming game. even though it will inevitably be compared to stardew and the wave of other similar games that have been released over the years, this is not a farming game. to me personally, sandrock is much closer to modded minecraft, factorio, or satisfactory. what you do get, inspired by stardew (harvest moon, shout out to the og) and its legacy, are npcs to talk to and romance, quests to fulfil for said npcs, and regular festivals.

i personally enjoy the very clear loop of resource gathering and refinement to fulfil quests immensely. like portia (as rough around the edges as it was), sandrock is very good at finding the balance between regular resource gathering to make any progress, without becoming too grindy (but! i'd guess i am in the latter first third of the game, so who knows if this stays true). resources can be acquired in many ways, and there's always one that is easiest or most enjoyable to do. 

npcs feel much deeper than in your average cozy farming game, with several of them having their own agency beyond reacting to your input. you might want to romance one of the bachelorettes, but she might not be sure that it's something that fits into her or your life - and so you have to do quests and navigate dialogue to figure the problem out together.
many of the npcs also step out of the typical archetypes as you get to know them, or offer archetypes from the get-go that aren't often used in these types of games. 

i thoroughly enjoy the writing, which i did not expect to this amount. i certainly liked portia, but i feel like the localisation of sandrock is a big improvement (except for not giving us qi's or fang's full names!). there are plenty of references to popular culture that actually made me chuckle. 

several - but not all - voice actors are also doing a fantastic job. i had pen written off as uninteresting from the start, but his voice actor is doing an incredible job with his character, and i have come to enjoy him much more than i thought. however, some voice actors keep throwing me off with their line deliveries, or their accents. nothing i could not see beyond or that would fully break immersion, but still noticeable if contrasted with the excellent other cast members.

at time of writing this review, i have played through 1.5 seasons in about 30 hours of gameplay. i do not rush any quests and make full use of the non-existent deadlines for major plot quests. i feel like i am just about have the plot open up for me, and have not even arrived at later content that is hailed to be the best. i'm certainly looking forward to experiencing the rest of this game, and would recommend this game to anyone.",15069,Note Kickstarter Backer Sandrock Improves Portia Leaps Bounds Takes Addicting Loop Gathering Resources Build Machines Finish Projects Build Machines Resources Wraps Cozy Blanket Npcs Deep Setting Farming Game Inevitably Compared Stardew Wave Games Released Farming Game Personally Sandrock Closer Modded Minecraft Factorio Satisfactory Inspired Stardew Harvest Moon Shout Og Legacy Npcs Talk Romance Quests Fulfil Npcs Regular Festivals Personally Enjoy Loop Resource Gathering Refinement Fulfil Quests Immensely Portia Rough Edges Sandrock Finding Balance Regular Resource Gathering Progress Grindy Guess Game Stays True Resources Acquired Easiest Enjoyable Npcs Feel Deeper Average Cozy Farming Game Agency Reacting Input Romance Bachelorettes Fits Life Quests Navigate Dialogue Figure Npcs Step Typical Archetypes Offer Archetypes Types Games Enjoy Writing Expect Portia Feel Localisation Sandrock Improvement Qi Fang Names Plenty References Popular Culture Chuckle Voice Actors Fantastic Job Pen Written Uninteresting Start Voice Actor Incredible Job Character Enjoy Voice Actors Throwing Deliveries Accents Break Immersion Noticeable Contrasted Excellent Cast Time Writing Review Played 1 5 Seasons 30 Hours Gameplay Rush Quests Existent Deadlines Major Plot Quests Feel Plot Arrived Content Hailed Experiencing Rest Game Recommend Game,POSITIVE,1,0,61,9,0.8714285714285714

2023-11-03,"185 hours. this was the total hours i played on this game while it was still on early access and now that my time at sandrock is officially released this will easily double. i play a ton of farming/building/life sims but never quite as much as i have for this one (barring animal crossing which i feel is in a sub genre of it's own when it comes to sim games because of its real life time shenanigans).

the gameplay loop is addictive and will definitely give you that ""just one more day"" feeling in games like this one. if you ever played my time at portia (which i also have over 100 hours on) then let me just say that this one is better in every single aspect. the environment is much different than the storybook style that portia has. you live in a harsh dessert and very much feels like starved for important resources like water (water is very important in this game) but i feel like seeing it transform with your help as the new ""builder"" makes it feel all the more rewarding. 

the npcs feel very engaging and alive and react based on interactions you have with them (i had one npc propose to start dating that i had to turn down and even though they seem to have taken the rejection well, you can still feel the heartbreak in the rejection with the ensuing dialogue you get from them when you try to talk to them again the following days). and yes! reverse proposals are a thing!

the storyline is probably one of the best ones i have seen in all the games i played in this genre. it pushes you to keep getting the resources and fulfilling the requests as soon as you can to see what happens next.

now though there is a bit of farming, the main focus of the game is more on building the town and creating the things needed for said town building. from stage displays, mining lifts, ""bus stops"" to even having to plant flowers and crafting benches to beautify the town-these are responsibilities that fall on you as the builder.

there are so many other great things to be said about my time at sandrock but i will say as someone who has stardew valley near and dear to my heart (i have 100% that game on my switch like twice already), that this is probably the only game so far that can rival the kind of enjoyment and satisfaction that stardew gives. honestly, even more so.",11835,185 Hours Total Hours Played Game Access Time Sandrock Officially Released Easily Double Play Ton Farming Building Life Sims Barring Animal Crossing Feel Genre Sim Games Real Life Time Shenanigans Gameplay Loop Addictive Day Feeling Games Played Time Portia 100 Hours Single Aspect Environment Storybook Style Portia Live Harsh Dessert Feels Starved Resources Water Water Game Feel Transform Builder Feel Rewarding Npcs Feel Engaging Alive React Based Interactions Npc Propose Start Dating Rejection Feel Heartbreak Rejection Ensuing Dialogue Talk Days Reverse Proposals Storyline Games Played Genre Pushes Resources Fulfilling Requests Bit Farming Main Focus Game Building Town Creating Town Building Stage Displays Mining Lifts Bus Stops Plant Flowers Crafting Benches Beautify Town Responsibilities Fall Builder Time Sandrock Stardew Valley Heart 100 Game Switch Game Rival Enjoyment Satisfaction Stardew Honestly,POSITIVE,1,0,74,8,0.9024390243902439

2023-11-17,"so, i beat my time at sandrock in a little over 122 hours. quite frankly, i felt the game could have been longer. i mean, by the time i felt like i resolved my money issues, the story was over. with how much world building the developers have done between sandrock and portia, the game could have and in my opinion, should have been a lot longer. i don't want to spoil the game too much for those still playing but with duvos representing the evil empire and how many open ended story lines they could have expanded upon, the game was just too short.  

the pathea games developers could have had the builder after the story line in sandrock was finished tp then travel to the other free cities building them up and connecting them while fighting duvos along the way with the story ending in the victory against the evil empire.

with my playthrough, i focused solely on the quests and commissions, i didn't dabble much in anything else. i imagine you would get a lot more out of my time at sandrock if you did all the social stuff. but for me, i never got around to marrying anyone or having a kid because i was always so broke to afford a bigger home. i was going by how my time at portia went with you needing to have a little bit of income, a nest egg if you will, in  order to establish a family, and all my gols went towards upgrading the shop and buying land.  

perhaps though, that is my own fault. still, with how expensive land expansion is and the higher tier of houses, i do wonder if the amount of gols provided to the player was too few and far between. 

granted, i know the objective is to earn your money, but as i found out later in the game the shops never had enough gols themselves to buy my crops and i ended up having to travel all the way to the ruins to sell them in the vending machine, which is good that was an option, it is just a bit of an inconvenience. i was also disappointed in the lack of enemies there was to fight after the last ruin diving location as i bought and crafted some of the best, if not the best gear in the game but never got the chance to use it on enemies that would challenge me. i know it sounds like i am complaining a lot, i just wanted more.

i may continue playing for the achievements but with the story progression done, i have lost that drive to want to boot up the game. grievances aside though, i still recommend this game, it was fun to play and it definitely had a fair amount of improvements over portia - overall, i rate it 4 out of 5.",10875,Beat Time Sandrock 122 Hours Frankly Game Time Resolved Money Issues Story Building Developers Sandrock Portia Game Opinion Lot Spoil Game Playing Duvos Representing Evil Empire Story Lines Expanded Game Short Pathea Games Developers Builder Story Sandrock Finished Travel Cities Building Connecting Fighting Duvos Story Victory Evil Empire Playthrough Focused Solely Quests Commissions Dabble Imagine Lot Time Sandrock Social Stuff Marrying Kid Broke Afford Bigger Time Portia Bit Income Nest Egg Establish Family Gols Upgrading Shop Buying Land Fault Expensive Land Expansion Tier Houses Gols Player Granted Objective Earn Money Game Shops Gols Crops Travel Ruins Sell Vending Machine Option Bit Inconvenience Disappointed Lack Enemies Fight Ruin Diving Location Bought Crafted Gear Game Chance Enemies Challenge Sounds Complaining Lot Continue Playing Achievements Story Progression Lost Drive Boot Game Grievances Recommend Game Fun Play Fair Improvements Portia Rate 4 5,POSITIVE,1,0,42,8,0.84

2023-11-16,"pros:
•	gameplay: at core my time at sandrock has simple gameplay: to advance the story you need to build x thing. but before that you need diagram for it, for x items you need z number of materials which you can get with upgraded tools and in specific dungeon. basically, it is a very intricate dopamine infused web which works quite well.
•	graphics: a vast improvement over last entry my time at portia.
•	storyline: i really enjoyed that writers expanded the lore about overall state of the known world. there are no promises given, but they left nice options for future games. the characters are fleshed out nicely. they all have their things, motives, and stories.
•	voiceacting: kudos to all voice actors, they did a great job.

cons:
•	pacing: the game clearly wants you to stop and grind. probably it shouldn’t be a surprise at this kind of game, but it started getting ridiculous once i started getting 10-15 levels higher than me. i finished the game at level 43 and carried level 55 gear in inventory in hopes i will level up. the problem is that there aren’t that many activities to do that. unless you want to repeat same 3 dungeons all over again, search for some enemies in open areas or grind for materials. there are commissions too, but unfortunately a limited amount per day. 
same pacing issues with the story. it seems like at first the scope was smaller but as they got the funds from kickstarter they started adding more and more things. the ending feels like very long epilogue. it is better than previous game, but this could really be improved.
•	silent protagonist: are we saving the resources, or the idea was that voice will break the immersion. for me it is opposite. i got used to it, but please voice for next protagonist.

neutral:
•	technical performance: i have way above recommended system requirements, but last 15 hours was really a pain at times. characters loading slightly 2-3 seconds into the cutscene, overall, longer loading times, even game crashing few times. most of it is annoying. nothing game breaking. and i believe these things will be fixed, but for now be cautious and have patience. factory seems the most broken feature, but at the time of the writing there is already one fix released addressing it. i really like factory in previous game, in my mind this is a step backwards, but maybe it will be changed too.
•	audio: there are few great songs in the game. i would suggest improving on this, to maybe add a radio or more tracks.
verdict:
the game is a major improvement from the previous entry. i supported both games in kickstarter and will support another entry which will hopefully come. i rarely write reviews as detailed as this one, seems i really cared??",11028,Pros Gameplay Core Time Sandrock Simple Gameplay Advance Story Build Diagram Items Materials Upgraded Tools Specific Dungeon Basically Intricate Dopamine Infused Graphics Vast Improvement Entry Time Portia Storyline Enjoyed Writers Expanded Lore Promises Left Nice Options Future Games Characters Fleshed Nicely Motives Stories Voiceacting Kudos Voice Actors Job Cons Pacing Game Grind Surprise Game Started Ridiculous Started 15 Levels Finished Game Level 43 Carried Level 55 Gear Inventory Hopes Level Activities Repeat 3 Dungeons Search Enemies Grind Materials Commissions Limited Day Pacing Issues Story Scope Funds Kickstarter Started Adding Feels Epilogue Previous Game Improved Silent Protagonist Saving Resources Idea Voice Break Immersion Voice Protagonist Neutral Technical Performance Recommended Requirements 15 Hours Pain Times Characters Loading 2 3 Cutscene Loading Times Game Crashing Times Annoying Game Breaking Fixed Cautious Patience Factory Broken Feature Time Writing Released Addressing Factory Previous Game Mind Step Changed Audio Songs Game Improving Add Radio Tracks Verdict Game Major Improvement Previous Entry Supported Games Kickstarter Support Entry Rarely Write Reviews Detailed Cared,POSITIVE,1,0,35,4,0.8974358974358975

i love portia and overall crafting games and this one is really one of the best the last years, the whole workshop feels great, the characters are great, the romance stuff feels great and making money feels good in it.

it hast like a 70-120 hour story depending on your speed that feels engaging and fun, thats one thing i miss from the most ""cozy"" games, but here you get a good story and world building.

2023-11-12,"for the first few hours i was kind of iffy on this game. i love the stardew genre of games though and the initial grid didn't deter me. i'm now 78 hours in and i can safely say this game is an absolute gem. it has everything you'd expect in a game like this, tool progression, a passable combat system, a modest tech tree and progressive efficiency gains, but there are a few things that put it above the rest of the competition within this genre.

1. inventory management is an absolute breeze. when crafting and turning in quests you have access to every item in every chest that you own. furthermore, when you go to any chest in your base to deposit items after a day of gathering, you can press a single button to automatically deposit all like-items into stacks across all of your chests. this game has completely solved the inventory management issue that bogs down mid and late-game in this genre and for that i tip my hat.

2. the writing in this game is phenomenal! the story is pretty bonkers and while being pretty cutesy and family friendly, crams in a lot of humor and some genuinely wild twists and turns. this game isn't high-drama, but it's just so much fun that i can't recommend it enough. the characters are also very well-written and unique.

3. the art design for this game is very unique and i think it'll age fairly well. the customization options you get on your character are pretty fun. i like seeing what other people made their avatars to look like. you also get an outfit tab separate from your equipment tab so you have total freedom to customize your look.

so all that said, there are a few cons that whittle this game down from being perfect to being in the 9/10 bracket.

1. the map is fairly limited in size. you'll spend a lot of time going back and forth through the same areas for dozens of hours.

2. the game is pretty grindy if you're looking to upgrade your farm to the largest possible size. it requires an absolutely diabolical amount of money and there aren't a lot of ways to make said money as easily as you can in stardew valley. there's a barn and coop structure that you can build, but they aren't very good revenue sources; the same can be said about farming. the real way to make money in this game is to fulfill a limited amount of crafting requests each day and then just grind the mines over and over. i wish there were more options for money making or that the farm plot upgrades were cheaper.

2023-11-09,"i liked ""my time at portia"" in spite of what it needed still in terms of polish. it was an ambitious game with many of the things it tried felt mostly half baked and not fully flushed out.

i can happily say that ""my time at sandrock"" not only meets the levels set up by it's predecessor, but also far exceeds them. 

first, the game proudly sticks with it's theme. every aspect of this is themed around you being in a desert, from basic crafting to even fishing. on a side note, this is easily the better fishing mini games i've played, but i wont spoil how that works.

second, the story is very engaging. ~50ish hours in, i'm very immersed in the setting and very motivated to keep going. the characters all seem to have their own motivations and there's a plethora of areas where their quests have pay off, both big and small. the small, being a mark of true craftsmanship.

third, the relationship mechanics are fantastic. they don't expand the barebones from the previous game (if it ain't broke don't fix it) but there's more to do around sandrock than portia. i do have a favorite addition though [spoiler] you literally hold hands with your partner when you're out on a date, they'll keep up with you as you run. this is the cutest damn thing in the world. bless whomever pushed that to get in because it was worth it.[/spoiler] 

if you've played the sequel, than this should be a no brainer. if you've not played the series, if not, i'd probably recommend going with the previous game first, but don't let that stop you if you're eager to start. there's nothing in portia that's critical for sandrock to be enjoyable.",15069,Time Portia Spite Terms Polish Ambitious Game Baked Flushed Happily Time Sandrock Meets Levels Set Predecessor Exceeds Game Proudly Sticks Theme Aspect Themed Desert Basic Crafting Fishing Note Easily Fishing Mini Games Played Spoil Story Engaging 50Ish Hours Immersed Setting Motivated Characters Motivations Plethora Quests Pay Mark True Craftsmanship Relationship Mechanics Fantastic Expand Barebones Previous Game Broke Sandrock Portia Favorite Addition Spoiler Literally Hold Hands Partner Cutest Damn Bless Pushed Worth Spoiler Played Sequel Brainer Played Series Recommend Previous Game Eager Start Portia Critical Sandrock Enjoyable,POSITIVE,1,0,61,9,0.8714285714285714

better than portia in every way, and i'm having a lot of fun.
- much higher production quality, as is apparent from cutscenes, voice acting, artwork, character designs, quests, writing, etc.
- many much appreciated qol improvements, such as being able to pet multiple farm animals at once.
- combat has been markedly improved (thank god), but still nothing to write home about.
- production loop has been vastly improved. no longer will your machines run 24/7 producing bronze plates. commissions and constructions ask for varied items in reasonably quantities.
- home customization has been introduced, letting you create whatever size and layout you like.

critiques:
- character customization is very basic, unfortunately.
- fishing! fish variety has been vastly trimmed down, and you're no longer incentivized to catch one of every fish; the fish tank is gone.
- many tooltips are holdovers from beta and therefore now inaccurate.
- 60 hours in and i have had 2 bugs that forced me to restart the client.
- inconsistencies in certain cutscenes.
- distinct lack of diversity in romanceable women. for men there's skinny dudes, chunky dudes, big dudes, older dudes, fem dudes, but for women there's only skinny young lady. some big girls or older ladies would have been nice.",19735,Sequel Disappoint Portia Lot Fun Production Quality Apparent Cutscenes Voice Acting Artwork Character Designs Quests Writing Appreciated Qol Improvements Pet Multiple Farm Animals Combat Markedly Improved God Write Production Loop Vastly Improved Machines 24 7 Producing Bronze Plates Commissions Constructions Varied Items Quantities Customization Introduced Letting Create Size Layout Critiques Character Customization Basic Fishing Fish Variety Vastly Trimmed Incentivized Catch Fish Fish Tank Tooltips Holdovers Beta Inaccurate 60 Hours 2 Bugs Forced Restart Client Inconsistencies Cutscenes Distinct Lack Diversity Romanceable Women Skinny Dudes Chunky Dudes Dudes Dudes Fem Dudes Women Skinny Lady Girls Ladies Nice,POSITIVE,1,0,49,11,0.8166666666666667

2023-11-21,"[i]my time at portia[/i] was a real surprise for me when i first played it. i'm pretty sure i got it in a bundle. it looked like someone had repurposed the assets of a korean mmo from 2010. but it turned out to be an unexpectedly feature rich game with an interesting post-apocalyptic worldbuilding, gameplay with genuinely novel ideas in combining the day-to-day work cycle and socializing of [i]harvest moon[/i] with softer factory game mechanics and combat, and just a good amount of content that was fun despite the jank.

[i]my time at sandrock[/i] takes all the good ideas of its predecessor which felt accidentally good at many times, and elevates them so you can make no mistake that pathea are actually a really talented and hardworking company that knows what they're doing. is it free of jank? no, not really. but it's so chockful of good things that even the jank becomes charming. it has a great, interesting story full of characters with vibrant personalities and not the paper-thin cutouts you get in [i]stardew valley[/i]. the world of the setting is so fully realized despite the series' cartoony nature and you feel excited to explore and learn about it. it is genuinely laugh out loud funny at many points, and genuinely emotional at others. i have to give it up for the vas who don't seem like professionals but are still giving their best. the building gameplay while its core loop is the same, sees a lot of qol improvements. the combat is more dynamic and offers a bit of challenge though it's still on the casual side. there's so many small charming details too, like when you go on dates in-game, they put in an animation where your significant other holds your hand. they didn't have to do that. it has no mechanical value. it's just cute and it makes you feel good.

stuff like that is why i think most of all, what the game nails is that it makes it good to be in sandrock, and to see sandrock grow. everyone who plays games for long enough understands the feeling where a place in a game becomes like a real place we have visited and been in, and we feel a sort of nostalgia seeing it. i think sandrock will feel that way to many people playing the game, it's such a wonderfully crafted setting, and it really fulfills the promise of the genre of ""life sim"" where you can take a break from reality and live somewhere else for a little while. i'm not even done with the main story. i restarted with 1.0 to experience it as intended since in beta lots of the quests squished together in buggy ways as they were implemented, but i feel glad to have done that. i feel this is gonna be a game i will have good memories of and consider a favorite years from now.

2023-11-21,"for the portia enthusiasts; i found everything in sandrock to be as good as or better than it was in portia. they made an amazing number of quality-of-life improvements to the crafting system, made firesides and important events much easier to remember with fully customizable calendar reminders, and vastly expanded your ability to design your house and workshop buildings. characters and story are also far more fleshed out compared to portia, and the relationship system felt more organic, especially dating/hanging out. finally, combat feels smoother and more satisfying, with excellent use of ramping and sound effects to make your combos feel weighty and dangerous. all in all, i think if you like portia, you're going to love this game! 

for those coming into the ""my time"" series for the first time: i don't know what you look for in your simulation games, but i look for a sense of progression and accomplishment that are sometimes difficult to get in real life. i have yet to encounter another simulation game which accomplishes this end as well as sandrock does. you play a ""builder"" charged with crafting and installing objects  large and small to improve the town and the lives of the people who live there. over the course of the game's gargantuan (~100hr) main quest, your actions have noticeable and immense effects on the landscape and the citizens around you. citizens react to the things you've done and appreciate you for what you've done. by the end of the game, you really feel like you are a valued part of a precious community. i can't recommend this title highly enough. my only warning is that if you start with sandrock, you might find it difficult to go back and play the earlier title in the series, my time at portia, since sandrock makes a number of quality-of-life improvements that i no longer want to play without!",9327,Portia Enthusiasts Sandrock Portia Amazing Quality Life Improvements Crafting Firesides Events Easier Remember Customizable Calendar Reminders Vastly Expanded Ability Design House Workshop Buildings Characters Story Fleshed Compared Portia Relationship Organic Dating Hanging Finally Combat Feels Smoother Satisfying Excellent Ramping Sound Effects Combos Feel Weighty Dangerous Portia Love Game Coming Time Series Time Simulation Games Sense Progression Accomplishment Difficult Real Life Encounter Simulation Game Accomplishes Sandrock Play Builder Charged Crafting Installing Objects Improve Town Lives People Live Game Gargantuan 100Hr Main Quest Actions Noticeable Immense Effects Landscape Citizens Citizens React Game Feel Valued Precious Community Recommend Title Highly Warning Start Sandrock Difficult Play Earlier Title Series Time Portia Sandrock Quality Life Improvements Play,POSITIVE,1,0,165,11,0.9375

there's absolutely no challenge at all. fighting is less than trivial (making armor and everything pretty meaningless), there's not the slightest punishment for errors, and you can't even make wrong decisions, even if you'd try.

but that's also the charm of it if you're into those casual relaxing games with no challenge. it's kinda like the exact opposite of a souls-like.

2023-11-21,"? total: 9/10 ?

if you loved my time at portia, or in general you like chilled crafting/farming/mining and doing quests in your own pace, then you will love my time at sandrock too! 

long version: i am playing since the game was in early access (didn't have too much time back then, but i am starting now to put more time into it), and the game has improved a lot with the recent release and the devs are always fixing and adding stuff. i am sure i will spend many more hours as the storyline goes on, as there are always many things to do and you never get bored.  
i did not face any bugs/issues myself until now.
the only hurdle was in the beginning of the game to figure out the whole water/fuel situation for the machines (it took me a while to get the whole system and i was a bit frustrated back then, but i am glad i came back and figured it out). it could be that i missed something on my end/things are easier now. 

plus point: we have the option for multiplayer! i haven't tried it yet, but i am excited to do so with my friends!

i've played 116 hours so far.  some of the quality of life changes are excellent. the story like is great and has some twists that i didn't see coming. 
there are a couple things you need to be aware of before you start out in my time at sandrock.
1)  some of the side quests need to be completed or the main story will not progress.  not sure why they are marked, but my suggestion is to just do all the side quests as the story progresses.
2) there is a small area that requires platforming.. not a bid deal, but i hate platforming so i did find it a little frustrating.  but if i can get thru it anyone can.
3) you do have to fight and kill animals.  there isn't a way around this that i can tell.  so if you don't like to fight or kill monsters, then maybe reconsider getting this game.
4) i do not have good hand eye coordination so some of the boss battles are problematic for me.  i am at a point in the story where i've tried to beat a specific boss at least 1o times.   so for me... i will not be completing the game, it's just to frustrating for me.  i play to relax.
all that being said, i still think it's a great game and worth getting if you are more skilled than i am.

i feel like a lot of indie farming/cozy sims do not focus a lot on the characters and dialogue, but every npc in sandrock feels alive and it just gives me a different cozy feeling no other sim game has before. the voice acting is really good for the most part, they comment on a new hairstyle you have, they comment on you not going to bed early enough, sometimes characters talk to each other and you can listen in. i am sure the very long story has a lot to do with it too, which i have not finished yet, but is way more involved and in depth than other games of this kind (from what i know).
personally i have had no bugs on pc in the full release, but i do know that there are things to be fixed, which the developers are very quick to address, from what i have seen. i am really glad i picked this up, and i am sure it will be one of my favourites in this genre for a long time!",10875,Totally Clicked Time Portia Creepy Feeling Character Models Sandrock Gameplay Loop Fun Relaxing Lots Qol Features Saving Anytime Pulling Items Chests Crafting Fulfilling Requests Enjoy Game Writing Social Aspect Feel Lot Indie Farming Cozy Sims Focus Lot Characters Dialogue Npc Sandrock Feels Alive Cozy Feeling Sim Game Voice Acting Comment Hairstyle Comment Bed Characters Talk Listen Story Lot Finished Involved Depth Games Personally Bugs Pc Release Fixed Developers Quick Address Glad Picked Favourites Genre Time,POSITIVE,1,0,42,8,0.84
2023-11-17,"this is 2 games in one. i play multiplayer and single player and i'm so wonderfully surprised that there's new things to experience in both modes. multiplayer has its own missions/focus when i play with friends. when i play single player, it has it's own story and depth that is very different from multiplayer. so to me, going back and forth doesn't feel repetitive to me. 
what i loved about multiplayer that made it stand out from the crowd is that the host does not have to be online to play. anyone can hop in at anytime and that was a huge game changer for me. 

achievement hunters take note: no achievements can be earned in multiplayer. they are single player exclusive. 

as for the actual gameplay, it's been jaw droppingly sensational. i played my time at portia, and i went from not wanting to marry anyone because the character models were bleh, to now wanting to marry everyone because they're all hot!

for real though, if you played portia, this is an absolute must to play. no doubt about it. there's improvements across the board. if you've never played portia, but liked stardew or rune factory, then get his game. its not just farming. it has combat, building, workshop customization, story, collecting, etc. just about anything you'd want in this kind of game.

2023-11-16,"i bounced off my time at portia quite hard so i was really surprised how much i really enjoyed my time at sandrock. 

is the game still far too grindy? yes. i really wish they could tone down how much busywork is in these games and the reliance of in-game timers to finish crafting items and juggling between multiple devices. but this is really my only strong criticism other than fairly weak combat.

but this life sim does one thing better than any other released this year or in recent memory - it creates a real sense of community and growth. my biggest bugbear about games like animal crossing is that you, the player, are the only person doing anything to help the world around you while everyone just sits pretty and asks you to do the work. sandrock has you working with other characters to produce a better world and that's great. is this a facade most of the time where you're doing exactly the same amount of work as in any other game? probably - but it helps to see the other builders put in work and to see donation boxes already partially full from other members of the community even if it is a trick. 

the characters are mostly pretty memorable and interesting - i usually struggle in other games of this type with remembering who is who, especially with romance-able characters who all seem bland and slapdash - and it does a good job of creating pricks in the community who you really wish you didn't have to deal with but have to because that's how a community is sometimes. 

the final 'act' of the game is quite special and while it had some of the grindiest components, i was glad i stuck through it because it was good to see how much of a difference i had made from when the game started and where i ended up in a way these games often don't really do. 

all in all, i highly recommend it as one of my favourite games of 2023 but i'd like to see future entries in the series maybe tone down the grind.",11028,Bounced Time Portia Hard Surprised Enjoyed Time Sandrock Game Grindy Tone Busywork Games Reliance Game Timers Finish Crafting Items Juggling Multiple Devices Strong Criticism Weak Combat Life Sim Released Memory Creates Real Sense Community Growth Biggest Bugbear Games Animal Crossing Player Person Sits Pretty Sandrock Characters Produce Facade Time Game Helps Builders Donation Boxes Partially Community Trick Characters Pretty Memorable Struggle Games Type Remembering Romance Characters Bland Slapdash Job Creating Pricks Community Deal Community Final Game Special Grindiest Components Glad Stuck Difference Game Started Games Highly Recommend Favourite Games 2023 Future Entries Series Tone Grind,POSITIVE,1,0,35,4,0.8974358974358975

2023-11-06,"as you can probably tell from the playtime, i adore this game. coming in at the 200 hour mark (and possibly a few more) is no mean feat.

my time at sandrock took the formula pathea started in portia and dialed it up to the next level. the game plays roughly the same. you're a brand new builder that arrived at a town that is in decline and it is up to you to turn your talents to improve the lives of those around you.

the gameplay loop is fairly simple. go out into the wilds, gather resources, bring them back to your workshop and get your machines turning out the components necessary to fulfill your commissions, upgrade your capabilities and home, repeat. to do this, you manage stamina as you gather materials and also engage in light, fairly simple combat.

what pathea does well is package this up in a charming setting with an amazing cast of characters. the graphics engine, while simple, is supported by a unique art style that allows for a wide range of colorful residents of sandrock while keeping the system demand to a minimum. my 7800x3d and 7900xtx are utter overkill for this game. that said, don't let the relatively mild requirements fool you - the game is beautiful. the art style is timeless, the town has a unique feel and the landscape vistas are wonderful. i found myself taking in-game photos of things to take advantage of the customizable portrait decorations you can hang in your house and, later, factory.

the engine does have a few hitches. the draw distance is rather poor and there aren't intermediate level of detail models. objects will sort of pop into existence and if you have the lod bias set to anything less than maximum, you'll see the outline of a bubble immediately around you while the supports on your workshop's border fence pop into existence. it also struggles with longer game sessions, so if you play four hours at a time, you'll start to notice pathfinding breaking or weird artifacts like bushes floating up in space out in front of the temple of the light.

all in all though, i find the graphics and engine appealing. there are a few hitches and bugs here, though nothing experience breaking.

what really makes sandrock shine is the world pathea created. running in parallel with the events of portia, sandrock casts you as a builder that arrived in the town of the same name. the town is suffering from severe decline due to decades of resource mismanagement and environmental degradation. water is in short supply and routine sandstorms buffet the town, slowly chewing away what little life is left in the area. had it not been for a rich deposit of old world ruins, the town would have long since died and been left to vanish in the dunes of the euphala desert.

the town is populated with a rich cast of colorful characters with their own distinct personalities. my personal favorites are cooper, a local rancher who has a habit of speaking in lengthy diatribes and has a conspiracy theory streak (i swear cooper's voice actor had more lines than the next five characters combined), and unsuur, a well meaning but not too bright local deputy who loves rocks a bit too much who i liken to a combination of drax from guardians of the galaxy and barnie fife from the andy griffith show.

surprisingly, the plot is actually quite deep. there is more going on than a simple tale of you building up stuff. there is banditry, a conspiracy and more going on that has a surprising climax. sandrock not only has an interesting story, it goes well beyond what a charming life sim should be and fleshes out the broader world of the free cities alliance and the surrounding nations.

my time at sandrock is a solid combination of life sim and narrative experience combined with a light factory inventory management game. if you're looking for a nice change of pace, you can't go wrong here.",16388,Playtime Adore Game Coming 200 Hour Mark Feat Time Sandrock Formula Pathea Started Portia Dialed Level Game Plays Roughly Brand Builder Arrived Town Decline Talents Improve Lives Gameplay Loop Simple Wilds Gather Resources Bring Workshop Machines Components Fulfill Commissions Upgrade Capabilities Repeat Manage Stamina Gather Materials Engage Light Simple Combat Pathea Package Charming Setting Amazing Cast Characters Graphics Engine Simple Supported Unique Art Style Wide Range Colorful Residents Sandrock Keeping Demand Minimum 7800X3D 7900Xtx Utter Overkill Game Mild Requirements Fool Game Beautiful Art Style Timeless Town Unique Feel Landscape Vistas Wonderful Game Photos Advantage Customizable Portrait Decorations Hang House Factory Engine Hitches Draw Distance Poor Intermediate Level Models Objects Sort Pop Existence Lod Bias Set Maximum Outline Bubble Supports Workshop Border Fence Pop Existence Struggles Game Sessions Play Hours Time Start Notice Pathfinding Breaking Weird Artifacts Bushes Floating Space Temple Light Graphics Engine Appealing Hitches Bugs Experience Breaking Sandrock Shine Pathea Created Running Parallel Events Portia Sandrock Casts Builder Arrived Town Town Suffering Severe Decline Decades Resource Mismanagement Environmental Degradation Water Short Supply Routine Sandstorms Buffet Town Slowly Chewing Life Left Rich Deposit Ruins Town Died Left Vanish Dunes Euphala Desert Town Populated Rich Cast Colorful Characters Distinct Personalities Personal Favorites Cooper Local Rancher Habit Speaking Lengthy Diatribes Conspiracy Theory Streak Swear Cooper Voice Actor Lines Characters Combined Unsuur Meaning Bright Local Deputy Loves Rocks Bit Liken Combination Drax Guardians Galaxy Barnie Fife Andy Griffith Surprisingly Plot Deep Simple Tale Building Stuff Banditry Conspiracy Surprising Climax Sandrock Story Charming Life Sim Fleshes Broader Cities Alliance Surrounding Nations Time Sandrock Solid Combination Life Sim Narrative Experience Combined Light Factory Inventory Management Game Nice Change Pace Wrong,POSITIVE,1,0,45,6,0.8823529411764706

2023-11-06,"unpopular opinion but i wasn't a fan of my time at portia and found it kind of overrated, so i was very surprised when my time at sandrock ended up being one of my favourite games of all time. i've played a lot of life sim style games and this is one of the best by far - it's the only one i've played to rival my love of rune factory 4 in terms of gameplay, story and character dialogue.

i have 110+ hours in the game (started a bit before the 1.0 release) and i'm not even finished the main story quests yet, i thought i was almost done a while back and it turned out i was only 2/3 of the way through. there are always meaningful story events happening and new characters being introduced to keep things interesting. 

there are a lot of activities to do each day to stop things getting too monotonous - a mix of exploration, dungeon crawling, mining or hanging around town. you can also fish and farm, which i'm not too fond of doing in this game but are totally optional outside of a couple of quests. 

the characters are where this game stands out - the localization team did a great job with the dialogue because it's full of personality and can be pretty hilarious at times. the town is very lively with the characters all having different relationships to each other and having a lot of joint quests and scenes so it feels like a real community. one downside is the day to day dialogue lines can get kind of repetitive but there are a lot of character related events which is where the bulk of the content is. their faces are also not that expressive in dialogue which would be my main complaint, but the voice acting is very expressive and fills that gap. 

there are some bugs at the moment but the devs seem very active and engaged with the community. aside from the bugs the game feels very polished, and i'm honestly blown away at the sheer scale of it for a relatively small company. there is so much content, from the very long main story, to the numerous character quests, to the new locations, mines and dungeons to unlock. and unlike portia each mine/ruin feels unique and has distinct level design features to keep things interesting. honestly huge props to the devs for what they've achieved here, you can tell a lot of love was put into the game and they genuinely had fun with the world and characters they created (speaking of the world, the worldbuilding is pretty in depth and the setting is very interesting - i did love the concept of my time at portia despite my criticisms of the game, and that interesting history continues to be explored here).",16388,Unpopular Opinion Fan Time Portia Overrated Surprised Time Sandrock Favourite Games Time Played Lot Life Sim Style Games Played Rival Love Rune Factory 4 Terms Gameplay Story Character Dialogue 110 Hours Game Started Bit 1 0 Release Finished Main Story Quests 2 3 Meaningful Story Events Happening Characters Introduced Lot Activities Day Monotonous Mix Exploration Dungeon Crawling Mining Hanging Town Fish Farm Fond Game Totally Optional Couple Quests Characters Game Stands Localization Team Job Dialogue Personality Pretty Hilarious Times Town Lively Characters Relationships Lot Joint Quests Scenes Feels Real Community Downside Day Day Dialogue Lines Repetitive Lot Character Events Bulk Content Expressive Dialogue Main Complaint Voice Acting Expressive Fills Gap Bugs Moment Devs Active Engaged Community Bugs Game Feels Polished Honestly Blown Sheer Scale Company Content Main Story Numerous Character Quests Locations Mines Dungeons Unlock Portia Ruin Feels Unique Distinct Level Design Features Honestly Huge Props Devs Achieved Lot Love Game Genuinely Fun Characters Created Speaking Worldbuilding Pretty Depth Setting Love Concept Time Portia Criticisms Game History Continues Explored,POSITIVE,1,0,45,6,0.8823529411764706
2023-11-06,"let me preface this by saying that i played my time at portia and didn't enjoy it at all. my time at sandrock absolutely blows it out of the water, and addresses my two most standout grievances about the first.

this time, they have designed the map properly so that your character never spends too long traversing from one location to another. the town map/level is beautifully made so that your workshop is never too far from any npcs you might need to reach/chat with daily. secondly, this is the most fun i've had with a towns' npc population in a while. a lot of cozy game developers forget to develop their characters beyond the basic, typical strokes. at first i felt like this would be the case for sandrock too, but i found myself genuinely enjoying a lot of the town's npc personalities that shine through their questlines. the writing isn't nearly the best i've seen in a game, but it's definitely a step above most cozy games i've played recently. at least more fun, if anything!

if i had to pick at any obvious downsides, i'd say that some voice actors are clearly uncomfortable in their characters' accents and inflections and it shows. i don't mind it too much but it might be grating to some.

i'm not much of a reviewer so he's my highlights.

good

-the visuals-the visual presentation is great. the style they started with in portia was kept for sandrock and tightened, cleaned, and it really pops. a straight improvement from its predecessor.

-characters-the characters fit with the world that these games take place in. goofballs on the one hand but can be serious on the other. it does a good job of portraying a tight knit group that has history with each other and rely on each other. the vas do a good job and you never really feel like its being phoned in.

-story-so, you've played some harvest moon games, stardew valley, and similar games...whelp, you know what kind of story you're getting into. that's not a bad thing though, we love those stories and that's why we scoop games like these up because while every story in these style of games has a similar foundation what's built on top of it gives us an insight into the biggest character in these games, the town. the town is a character all its own, a combination of its past, present, environment, and the characters living in, around, or otherwise interacting with it throughout the story. it takes on a life of its own and sandrock, as a town/character, is fun to see develop.

-qol-there were so many improvements to make life much easier in sandrock, it would almost make portia a little harder to go back to. but i very much appreciate everything they implemented in sandrock to make a builders life easier when it comes to making your shop hum along and get those contracts done. something a portia player can appreciate more than a newbie but a thumbs up from me.

bad

let me preface this by saying i'm not a tech savvy man, what you know about the power of rigs and all of the bells and whistles is probably beyond me so take this short section of bad with a grain of salt, your results may vary.

when i'd start up the game, while my load times were rather quick when i'd get into the game it could take a solid minute, at max, for the world to load everything. if i got into the game and i was loading in while in the house, that was fine but once i left the house or would load into a game that had me outside there could be a bit of a wait for things to load. i never found it a terrible thing but a rig that's a little on the lower end might have more of an issue.

the other thing i noticed is that if i played for a block of 3-4 hours in a row i could start to experience slowdown that became much more significant as the time would go on and control inputs would also be laggy. a couple times character path-finding became erratic and would be my prompt to log off. i haven't done blocks like that in a while and so i don't know if it's a concern and it may have just been my machine but i did experience that.",19735,Picked Time Sandrock Access Enjoyed Time Portia Excited Jump Development Ride Enjoyed Portia Picked Highly Disappointed Reviewer Highlights Visuals Visual Presentation Style Started Portia Sandrock Tightened Cleaned Pops Straight Improvement Predecessor Characters Characters Fit Games Goofballs Hand Job Portraying Tight Knit History Rely Vas Job Feel Phoned Story Played Harvest Moon Games Stardew Valley Games Whelp Story Bad Love Stories Scoop Games Story Style Games Foundation Built Insight Biggest Character Games Town Town Character Combination Environment Characters Living Interacting Story Takes Life Sandrock Town Character Fun Develop Qol Improvements Life Easier Sandrock Portia Harder Implemented Sandrock Builders Life Easier Shop Hum Contracts Portia Player Newbie Thumbs Bad Preface Tech Savvy Power Rigs Bells Whistles Short Bad Grain Salt Vary Start Game Load Times Quick Game Solid Minute Max Load Game Loading House Fine Left House Load Game Bit Wait Load Terrible Rig Issue Noticed Played Block 3 4 Hours Row Start Experience Slowdown Time Control Inputs Laggy Couple Times Character Path Finding Erratic Prompt Log Blocks Concern Machine Experience,POSITIVE,1,0,49,11,0.8166666666666667

2023-11-04,"this is a general improvement of portia, with numerous qol improvements and better graphics.  if you want a chill builder sim game with a side of combat, this is a decent pick up.  that said there's a few things from the original that haven't improved:

-the combat is still too simplistic.  there are still no special attacks (the enemies get them, but not the player) so all you do for the most part is mash lmb and roll dodge once in a while.  there are ranged weapons, but having to constantly build more ammo is annoying so you'll just melee everything for the most part.
-the main story drags on way too long.  this was probably my main complaint about portia as well.  as another reviewer put it, there's an interesting major plotline where you fully expect the story to end afterwards but it drags on with more mundane busywork for another 10-15 hours.
-waiting on things.  you can speed up time to 3x speed at least without mods, but it can still take 15+ minutes of real time to smelt a stack of bars so a lot of the time you'll just toss stuff in and end the day to skip time.
-relation grind.  like the first game it is slow and tedious.  some characters aren't too bad because they constantly put up commissions which give a big chunk for something you want to do anyways, or are heavily involved in story missions.  others, like the doctor, require you go out of your way to talk to and constantly do boring crap like play critters (basically rock paper scissors with cards) over and over.  as a bonus middle finger, [spoiler]several characters leave partway through main story and get replaced by new ones[/spoiler].  hope you didn't waste your time on those ones!

overall though, it's a decent game for the price.  i never finished portia, i tried twice and got bored halfway through both times.  sandrock at least improved the gameplay enough to make me finish it this time.",16806,Improvement Portia Numerous Qol Improvements Graphics Chill Builder Sim Game Combat Decent Pick Original Improved Combat Simplistic Special Attacks Enemies Player Mash Lmb Roll Dodge Ranged Weapons Constantly Build Ammo Annoying Melee Main Story Drags Main Complaint Portia Reviewer Major Plotline Expect Story Drags Mundane Busywork 15 Hours Waiting Speed Time 3X Speed Mods 15 Minutes Real Time Smelt Stack Bars Lot Time Toss Stuff Day Skip Time Relation Grind Game Slow Tedious Characters Bad Constantly Commissions Chunk Heavily Involved Story Missions Doctor Require Talk Constantly Boring Crap Play Critters Basically Rock Paper Scissors Cards Bonus Middle Finger Spoiler Characters Leave Partway Main Story Replaced Spoiler Hope Waste Time Decent Game Price Finished Portia Bored Halfway Times Sandrock Improved Gameplay Finish Time,POSITIVE,1,0,56,7,0.8888888888888888

2023-11-03,"my time at sandrock have been a captivating and immersive gaming experience. from the moment i set foot in this post-apocalyptic world, i was drawn into its rich narrative, extensive crafting system, and the challenges it presented.

the landscape of sandrock is a visual treat, with its desolate beauty and a sense of exploration that kept me engaged for hours on end. the attention to detail in the environment and the variety of biomes made every journey exciting, whether i was traversing the  wastelands or navigating the mysterious ruins.

the crafting system is where sandrock truly shines. with a wide array of resources to gather and a plethora of blueprints to discover, i was constantly motivated to experiment and create new items, from weapons and tools to cozy furnishings for my humble abode. the feeling of progress as i upgraded my workshop and expanded my capabilities was incredibly rewarding.

the interactions with the colorful cast of characters in sandrock added depth to the story and provided a sense of community in an otherwise harsh world. building relationships with the townsfolk was an enjoyable aspect of the game, and their unique personalities and quests brought the game world to life.

while my time at sandrock was largely enjoyable, there were occasional technical hiccups and performance issues that could be frustrating. however, the frequent updates from the developers gave me hope that these issues would be resolved over time.

in conclusion, my 150 hours at sandrock have been a delightful adventure. the combination of exploration, crafting, and storytelling in this unique post-apocalyptic world made it a memorable gaming experience, and i look forward to further updates and improvements as i continue to explore and build in this engaging sandbox world.",11835,Time Sandrock Captivating Immersive Gaming Experience Moment Set Foot Post Apocalyptic Drawn Rich Narrative Extensive Crafting Challenges Landscape Sandrock Visual Treat Desolate Beauty Sense Exploration Engaged Hours Attention Environment Variety Biomes Journey Exciting Traversing Wastelands Navigating Mysterious Ruins Crafting Sandrock Shines Wide Array Resources Gather Plethora Blueprints Discover Constantly Motivated Experiment Create Items Weapons Tools Cozy Furnishings Humble Abode Feeling Progress Upgraded Workshop Expanded Capabilities Incredibly Rewarding Interactions Colorful Cast Characters Sandrock Depth Story Sense Community Harsh Building Relationships Townsfolk Enjoyable Aspect Game Unique Personalities Quests Brought Game Life Time Sandrock Enjoyable Occasional Technical Hiccups Performance Issues Frustrating Frequent Updates Developers Hope Issues Resolved Time Conclusion 150 Hours Sandrock Delightful Adventure Combination Exploration Crafting Storytelling Unique Post Apocalyptic Memorable Gaming Experience Updates Improvements Continue Explore Build Engaging Sandbox,POSITIVE,1,0,74,8,0.9024390243902439

2023-10-24,"my time at sandrock is a fun farm/life sandbox game and the sequel to my time at portia, which i also recommend.

good:

housing is a big factor when it comes to farming games, in this game you can customize your farm however you want, you can make your land mainly like a factory, farm or a beautiful homestead while not worrying about the other two as much.

commissions are the main money maker in the game that also rewards you with a good amount of relationship for certain characters and workshop reputation points. i highly recommend doing these daily and picking the most profitable ones as money is more important than the other two rewards.

saving midday is not a common thing to happen in farm/life sim games and that is why i really like this game, (portia doesn't have this feature). also that comes with midday saves is when you complete a quest or commission you auto save and have a quick save which is really handy to have.

surprisingly enough as well as the previous game, there are english voice actors despite being an indie game from china, every secondary character is voiced by someone. while it isn't fully voice acted (unvoiced lines or grunts that don't match dialogue) it does offer a solid amount of voice acting when it comes to story events to make you really feel immersed.

there are a large variety of weapons, you can have 4 types of melee weapons, multiple ranged weapons and even some unique weapons that can't be crafted. each melee weapon has its own style and combo, whether it be daggers for fast but weak attacks or a greatsword which is slow but does a lot of damage.

decent:

relationships in this game follows every other farm/life sim game, there isn't a weekly limit but if you give an item too much they will like it less. the game is good at indicating if there is a relationship event going on as it will be marked on your map but the game doesn't really tell you if you even have events available for a character or if it is just end of current build.

there is a skill tree that you can do, but maxing out those 4 skills basically just fill up the entire tree leaving no real choice in the end. skill points are only gained by doing those specific skills. though i do think this idea is pretty neat, i will always prefer character levels rewarding skill points (portia did this).

farming had a step-up from portia, where you are able to place farming plots anywhere on your land instead of planter boxes. you can easily and efficiently plant items the higher the toolbox up to a 4x4 planting/watering/fertilizing area which is quick and easy. farming has some flaws as well, farming early game is terrible. since it is just inefficient. you have to apply a lot of fertilizer, water and straw just to make a profit, you can't automate farming either so you have to constantly be on watch to water.

bad:

!!they added the feature to group items and move them in bulk in the 1.0 update!!

moving housing items is a real chore, there is no area select so you have to move each individual item one by one (including farming plots). i would just recommend using your character instead at some points. moving your house with 2+ stories is also annoying as whenever you move it, you have to move each individual story top to bottom and if you had items in the house after reapplying those stories, some might get removed since staircases don't remember their last known location but instead have a predetermined location every time you add a new floor.",2332,Time Sandrock Fun Farm Life Sandbox Game Sequel Time Portia Recommend Housing Factor Farming Games Game Customize Farm Land Factory Farm Beautiful Homestead Worrying Commissions Main Money Maker Game Rewards Relationship Characters Workshop Reputation Highly Recommend Daily Picking Profitable Money Rewards Saving Midday Common Happen Farm Life Sim Games Game Portia Feature Midday Saves Complete Quest Commission Auto Save Quick Save Handy Surprisingly Previous Game English Voice Actors Indie Game China Secondary Character Voiced Voice Acted Unvoiced Lines Grunts Match Dialogue Offer Solid Voice Acting Story Events Feel Immersed Variety Weapons 4 Types Melee Weapons Multiple Ranged Weapons Unique Weapons Crafted Melee Weapon Style Combo Daggers Fast Weak Attacks Greatsword Slow Lot Damage Decent Relationships Game Farm Life Sim Game Weekly Limit Item Game Indicating Relationship Event Marked Map Game Events Character Current Build Skill Tree Maxing 4 Skills Basically Entire Tree Leaving Real Choice Skill Gained Specific Skills Idea Pretty Neat Prefer Character Levels Rewarding Skill Portia Farming Step Portia Farming Plots Land Planter Boxes Easily Efficiently Plant Items Toolbox 4X4 Planting Watering Fertilizing Quick Easy Farming Flaws Farming Game Terrible Inefficient Apply Lot Fertilizer Water Straw Profit Automate Farming Constantly Watch Water Bad Feature Items Bulk 1 0 Update Moving Housing Items Real Chore Select Individual Item Including Farming Plots Recommend Character Moving House 2 Stories Annoying Individual Story Items House Reapplying Stories Removed Staircases Remember Location Predetermined Location Time Add Floor,POSITIVE,1,0,6,0,1.0

i love the aesthetics of the ui, the way the models of everything look so much better, and despite being in a desert area (i'm not a fan of desert settings usually), this one still won me over with its vibrant vibe. because it's cozy - the houses are lovely and the design of the atmosphere is adorable - and the community really helps it, you can tell people of sandrock care for each other as you go through your days in it. there's so much more to sandrock than just sand and cacti. it's got sandstorms, monsters, bandits, dungeons and dark stuff to uncover, but even through all that, the morning comes and you're greeted with the local smiles and a bunch of sweet mail and cute gifts by your house door. you've become part of this community now.

2023-11-25,"i loved my time at portia; it was a phenomenal game in this genre and i played several full play-throughs.  sandrock takes everything portia did and makes it even better.  there's more of everything and with a definite upgrade across the board.  have only run across a few minor bugs from release 1.0, but nothing game breaking and no worries.  the game itself is just fantastic, from the main story line (which i've barely even scratched yet, it appears) to combat to socializing to the building up of your workshop and everything that entails.

the characters are excellent across the board, from the irritating to the awesome.  sandy the camel is a nightmare. amirah is a smoke show.  two characters that couldn't be further apart in a large roster of very interesting and diverse characters.  

imho, game is already a 10/10.  i hope pathea games continues with a third game like this.  would love to see one take place fully within an ice biome.   but this?  definite home run!",11769,Loved Time Portia Phenomenal Game Genre Played Play Throughs Sandrock Takes Portia Definite Upgrade Board Minor Bugs Release 1 0 Game Breaking Worries Game Fantastic Main Story Barely Scratched Appears Combat Socializing Building Workshop Entails Characters Excellent Board Irritating Awesome Sandy Camel Nightmare Amirah Smoke Characters Roster Diverse Characters Imho Game Hope Pathea Games Continues Game Love Ice Biome Definite,POSITIVE,1,0,82,9,0.9010989010989011

the story is interesting enough from keeping you bored, and most of the characters are rather charming (some are total narcissist or forgot their neurons at home). bringing some characters from portia gives you little nostalgia too. 
soundtrack is ok.
the graphics is a lot cleaner but sometimes when you change settings, the game just decided that you want to play minecraft instead. // fix this please, my eyes hurt.
the gameplay is mostly the same as portia - the combat is a lot smoother although not that engaging (understandable since it's not an action game at heart).
at this time of review, there are still many minor bugs in game but the devs are transparent in trying to crush them - so a matter of time to clear them i hope.

2023-11-24,"at first i thought this was going to be a fairly slow, uneventful game, kinda like stardew valley where honestly, nothing really happened...except i was wrong, the story picked up, the plot kicked off, the sandrockers (npcs) having character growths, the land physically changing from your actions, it felt like everything said and done had an impact on it all!
this, unfortunately, i felt portia to be lacking, so when i went into this, i thought it was gonna be another mta: portia clone with some slight alterations, boy how wrong i was!
when (most) of the people spoke, i paid attention, i was invested, i had to know what came next or if this would be brought up further on, it was such a fantastic story driven game, they've really come a long way from portia. and, i've found out recently that they're working on another mta game, with the placeholder name ""project me"" which has me so excited to see what they'll accomplish after witnessing this game!

i stepped into this game thinking i would play at most maybe 10-30 hours before having the same dry spell i had with portia and never pick it back up...248 hours later! i've finally finished the game...and i feel empty...this is a good thing, if you feel empty or sad that something is over, that means it had an impact on you, it means you were properly enjoying yourself, and seeing the story end, just makes you feel...lonely, that you're already missing it...i don't get that feeling often, when i finish a game i enjoy i just throw my hands up and go ""done!"" and moving on with my day, this, was one of those few exceptions.

i wholeheartedly recommend this game, is it flawless? of course not, but i will rate it at 8.5-9/10.
it had it's flaws, but non of them was enough to stop me from enjoying it, nor really anything game breaking (except for one but that is cause my save was made during ea, so i'd imagine majority of my issues was because of that)


i'm leaving you with a warning and an advice or two.
this...is not a relaxing game, even if they're trying to get it nominated for a ""sit and relax"" award, this game will stress the heii out of you, having to make sure you got enough materials, the right upgrades for your machines, the recipes themselves, it becomes a lot, so when you're given the option to buy the factory control panel, for the love of nia (it'll make sense in-game) get it immediately, it'll make your life so much easier.
another advice is to make sure you got the ads running which you can get gol, rep, and exp increased (you interact with the news board next to the city hall), if you're lucky, you'll get all 3 (you can cancel ad and get it again for new results, costs 100 gol each time)
get the talents that increases the gol booster from the ad, get more gol from same day delivery, aswell as the turning in items of higher rarity (need a refiner for that)
befriend yan (and much later wei)
do all this, and money will never become an issue.
and even cheese it up a bit and reduce the size of your house and roof for some instant fast gol, several thousands to be exact.

2023-11-23,"one of my favorite games of all time. has the most complex social aspects i've seen in a game and what we usually all wanted for years with life sim games. other devs should take notes, honestly. 

the best part about this game: there is always plenty things to do, and they are all fun and useful, a lot of life sim games might have you build useless things. almost everything you build gets used in events, main story content, bridges to unlock new areas, oh, and there is always new places being unlocked as you progress, immersive atmosphere, new characters being introduced, and i mean years in-game. 408 hrs (continued from early access save) and i am still unlocking new characters, areas, story content.

all the characters are well voice and well written. and by well written---really, well written. i don't think i can play a harvest moon or story of seasons game after this tbh. it's spoiled me. the characters are fleshed out wonderfully, with their own thought out pasts, stories, you can talk about them in convo during play dates, or romantic ones. some characters have reverse confessions and characters have romance and friendship quests as well as multiple in story quests where other characters will talk and interact with you and eachother. i guarantee you will feel some emotion for every single one of these characters. characters i didn't like or care about before i got to know i grew to like later, their flaws and their traits both, and their stories. 

this is one of the most immersive games i've experienced. it makes you feel apart of the community, and the seratonin boosts you get just from speaking to villagers, getting gifts outside your house on your birthday or wedding day, having your partner ask if you'd like to spend the day together after marriage and take you on little dates when most games are like 'they are married, have kids' and it's either the end, or they are blank nobodies now that have no more content whatsoever! this game doesn't do that. 

if sandrock gets more content dlc or in the next my time game, if they decide to have a kid system, i'd rather no kids unless there is real content for them, this is what the people want pathea, even if you charge $ for it:

-family outings/content and story events with your child/partner, and with the townsfolk
-the child going to school/interacting with other children
-old enough to speak properly/help out around the work shop or be interested in another profession/maybe story content for the kid following qi or owen around if they wanted to work as a scientist apprentice/at the blue moon as a chef or waiter or something.  ((not neccessary, just would be super cute. i would just rather not have kids in a game, like how stardew did unless they have content, sandrock still beat the others for sure though.)) and maybe a better child system to know when your child needs something/bring them with you on a baby backpack or hire a babysitter if you can't be home.

i'm definitely doing another playthrough. it's easy to miss dialogue and content because there is so much((this is a good thing.)) we got so lucky with my time at sandrock and i feel like i would 100% die for any of the sandrockers fr. the story gets better and better. sometimes it's silly, sometimes it's serious, sometimes it's just fun. 

characters you befriend will someetimes show up outside your house because they miss you and want to hang out, and sometimes you will see a lot of ! events to unlock, where you can say to much is going on right now and get to it later.

you might walk into someones home and they are eating dinner together, arvios sister is visiting him, or the preacher is teaching jasmine how to speak politely if she didn't like an authors book. little details that bring life

oh, and don't get me started on the holidays. only game i cared about holidays. you have mini games on almost every one, from collecting ingredients on a yakmel and can bump into other people, grilling up food for the towns folk, a dance competition, and so much more.

on dates with friends and romantically, you can set off fireworks in a fun pattern of your choosing, draw in the sand, play whack a mole or games at the arcade, sit and talk on a bench or go out to eat and order them food. you can befriend folks easily without gift spamming. talking to them, being yourself and taking commissions/work on the request or commission board they asked for is helpful. some characters might need to unlock events to get there story or even be able to give gifts to them if they are more to themselves.

the personalities are well thought out. characters with pasts, multiple hobbies likes and dislikes, where most games the 'fisherman' is just a fisherman and nothing more, his entire personality. you will hear them talk about their family, their other interests, and things they like. the characters entire personality isnt just a trope or based around 1 thing. this is the best character development as well for some characters i've seen in a long time. i highly reccomend buying this. it will be a blast constantly.

usually life sims have moments when your bored. well 400 hrs in and still constant content. i'm just saying....i hope this becomes the new standard for life sims xd

2023-11-23,"honestly pretty good from start to finish as a single player game. i'd like to echo what i've seen in other reviews that the dialogue could have definitely been trimmed down. i also still think that the ""mini game"" portions like sand fishing and events like the dance off are extremely lacking to the point where i just never felt like participating in them beyond the first time. that wasn't a huge deal since none of it was really required and i finished the story before too much of it looped around (which is kinda where i stopped, after the credits roll it's pretty much just a sandbox since i did all the sidequests that had popped up already).

beyond that i feel my biggest gripe was the ""iffy"" pathing that really takes me out of it sometimes, seeing npcs just teleport around, or slowly teleport into frame for cutscenes was kinda jarring, i wish they would ""try a bit harder"" before just giving up and teleporting

for positives, it's fun for building and gathering. there always seems something to explore or do, many things i have not tried yet. there are some fun story lines. there is a lot of good voice acting and characters. i have been enjoying it and want to get more hours in.

for constructive criticism...

the game seems to get in the way of itself sometimes; multiple story lines colliding, arising every single day to a cut scene,  several people outside or unable to traverse the town without triggering a cut scene or multiples in a single day. i think it is clear the developers wanted lots of story and that is great. it was just sometimes i was so sick of cut scene over and over, i just wanted to move on and complete a quest or do my goal so would just click thru. other times did not realize cut scene would prob never trigger again and wish for opportunity later. not a game dev, so i don't know how to balance this kind of stuff, and understand i am a halfway try-hard that might push to many quest lines too early, but also say things seem unbalanced in this respect. 

otherwise pretty fun! hope they keep working on it.",9290,Review Play Portia Lot Deep Perspective History Positives Fun Building Gathering Explore Fun Story Lines Lot Voice Acting Characters Enjoying Hours Constructive Criticism Game Multiple Story Lines Colliding Arising Single Day Cut Scene People Unable Traverse Town Triggering Cut Scene Multiples Single Day Developers Lots Story Sick Cut Scene Complete Quest Goal Times Realize Cut Scene Prob Trigger Opportunity Game Dev Balance Stuff Understand Halfway Hard Push Quest Lines Unbalanced Respect Pretty Fun Hope,POSITIVE,1,0,247,20,0.9250936329588015
2023-11-22,"*review especially for console players (switch lite & oled steam deck)* - i originally bought this game for my switch lite. i was happy enough with the performance because it was a huge improvement over my time at portia on the switch. after playing 30+ hours i decided that this was a top game for me. it's amazing! but then i discovered that the switch game does not have the complete game... no kids and missing quests and such. lame.

a few weeks prior to this, i had looked at the steam deck. decided to not get it at that time. when i found out that my time at sandrock was the full version on pc, i went back to looking at the steam deck and saw the new oled version! well, i bought it. the oled steam deck is bigger than the switch lite by a fair bit, but i usually play while sitting in a chair anyways so i just rest it on my legs. the performance of the oled steam deck is incredible. my time at sandrock also plays extremely well on the oled steam deck. it plays pretty much like on the switch lite for button functionality but better because i actually went and changed around some control things. the graphics are incredible on the steam deck. i am so thrilled that i made the change over because this game is so much better on the steam deck. the load times are much less, the graphics are way better, and the game just runs smoother. 

for new players, you can change the run button from hold down to toggle. this makes running way easier. i also changed the interact button from y to a because it just makes more sense for me. a was the jump button originally. you can also turn off the yakmel station cut scene!!! thank goodness!

review for the game - this game is awesome. i mean, i really bought a oled steam deck for it. i enjoy playing on a console more than a pc, but this game has the best performance as a pc game and it is also the full game that is currently out.

i have played most of the story of seasons/harvest moon games, stardew valley, my time at portia... farming rpg's are my thing. this game is my favorite out of all of those. i felt like stardew valley was incredible for the huge world and opportunities, but that the character interaction was lacking. sandrock has a huge world, lots of things to do, and amazing character interaction. the storyline is huge and there are heaps of side quests that make me feel like i am involved in a story and town. it is simply amazing. usually, i don't care to romance multiple bachelors but... i feel differently in this game. these characters have depth that you just don't usually have in other games like this.

devs, you have done amazing work, and if you keep coming out with games like this, i will keep buying them. all the little improvements of game life are appreciated. how you can toggle through all your storage bins is great. having items in your storage at your disposal when filling requests and building things, amazing. you guys did a fantastic job. thank you! this is quite possibly my favorite game that i have ever played. 

gameplay tips for new players - for the first week in the game you get free access to the recycle junk area, go there everyday and break it all down. build three recyclers and stay on top of recycling all of it. for the first week you get half off at by the stairs. buy a storage box from there everyday of this half of week. use all your energy everyday, and do a commission everyday. just keep grinding it out. when the mines open up, make bronze bars as much as you can. upgrade your tools as soon as you can from the basic ones.",9290,Review Console Players Switch Lite Oled Steam Deck Originally Bought Game Switch Lite Happy Performance Huge Improvement Time Portia Switch Playing 30 Hours Decided Game Amazing Discovered Switch Game Complete Game Kids Missing Quests Lame Weeks Prior Looked Steam Deck Decided Time Time Sandrock Version Pc Steam Deck Oled Version Bought Oled Steam Deck Bigger Switch Lite Fair Bit Play Sitting Chair Rest Legs Performance Oled Steam Deck Incredible Time Sandrock Plays Extremely Oled Steam Deck Plays Pretty Switch Lite Button Functionality Changed Control Graphics Incredible Steam Deck Thrilled Change Game Steam Deck Load Times Graphics Game Runs Smoother Players Change Button Hold Toggle Running Easier Changed Interact Button Sense Jump Button Originally Yakmel Station Cut Scene Goodness Review Game Game Awesome Bought Oled Steam Deck Enjoy Playing Console Pc Game Performance Pc Game Game Played Story Seasons Harvest Moon Games Stardew Valley Time Portia Farming Rpg Game Favorite Stardew Valley Incredible Huge Opportunities Character Interaction Lacking Sandrock Huge Lots Amazing Character Interaction Storyline Huge Heaps Quests Feel Involved Story Town Simply Amazing Care Romance Multiple Bachelors Feel Game Characters Depth Games Devs Amazing Coming Games Buying Improvements Game Life Appreciated Toggle Storage Bins Items Storage Disposal Filling Requests Building Amazing Guys Fantastic Job Favorite Game Played Gameplay Tips Players Week Game Access Recycle Junk Everyday Break Build Recyclers Stay Recycling Week Stairs Storage Box Everyday Week Energy Everyday Commission Everyday Grinding Mines Bronze Bars Upgrade Tools Basic,POSITIVE,1,0,247,20,0.9250936329588015

2023-11-22,"this is a wonderfully adorable game that only builds upon the wonderful ideas that my time at portia started.  i still love the whole ""ruined technological world"" aesthetic and enjoyed all the references to your hard-working builder in portia.

i found the story even more interesting than the portia story and really enjoyed having a more friendly nature with your ""rival"" builder, unlike in portia.  i felt very invested in sandrock and really like how invested i got into the well-being of the town.

i have thoroughly loved every minute of this game, but i do feel that the end game becomes a little tedious.  once you get past the climax of the story and are only left with the city development stuff, story events start getting spread out and since most of your building is pretty self-sufficient due to the stockpiled resources, days can become quite empty and unfulfilling.  additionally, while i like some romances being unavailable until later in the game (same as in portia), some of the options only appear super late, making it a slog to make friends with or romance the last few people.

while i think these are valid criticisms, i still wholeheartedly love this game and look forward to putting many more hours into it.",9290,Wonderfully Adorable Game Builds Wonderful Ideas Time Portia Started Love Ruined Technological Aesthetic Enjoyed References Hard Builder Portia Story Portia Story Enjoyed Friendly Nature Rival Builder Portia Invested Sandrock Invested Town Loved Minute Game Feel Game Tedious Climax Story Left City Development Stuff Story Events Start Spread Building Pretty Sufficient Stockpiled Resources Days Unfulfilling Additionally Romances Unavailable Game Portia Options Super Late Slog Friends Romance People Valid Criticisms Wholeheartedly Love Game Putting Hours,POSITIVE,1,0,247,20,0.9250936329588015

2023-11-22,"mtas is, from the get-go, very similar to its predecessor my time at portia and for the most part that holds true as this was supposed to be an expansion before turning into a separate project.

does it separate itself enough to warrant a separate purchase? i believe so, although i believe the price increased since early access when i purchased it.

initially i was put off by the chosen setting as having a farming game be set in a desolate desert setting seemed like a tall order but the developers managed to introduce new mechanics to account for this without removing one of the core parts of the original game. i will not go into detail as some of these mechanics are also tied to the story which is appreciated as well. they may seem a bit tedious at the beginning but eventually as with the previous games most of the energy/water requirements become trivial from simply farming out other resources which i find to be nice as the game is already pretty grindy as its predecessor was in some aspects. a quick tip: do try to get a pet asap as they help a ton.
how grindy the game feels however depends on what you as the player would like to do and how stressed you feel about worker of the month/year nominations. if you want to keep ahead you will be farming 3-4 commissions daily as well as blowing all your stamina in abandoned ruins which can become a bit of a repetitive chore (for me this feeling started somewhere around winter 1st year). in order to avoid this i would recommend engaging with other parts of the game as well (hangouts/romance/building the house/farm) and not feeling like you need to squeeze out every ounce of stamina out of every day otherwise you will burn out quickly.

in terms of the story i still have not reached the complete conclusion but i believe nobody expected this game to bring out a game of the year contender in this regard.
if there is one thing however i would say that the pacing feels off for me. lot of the progression is gated by arbitrary amounts of days that have to pass in order for you to even receive an email that will tell you (at the beginning of a given day) that the story will continue 2 days from now. after those 2 days pass you usually go to a fireside meeting where they will say something usually followed by another day or 2 of waiting which became a real point of frustration as i already blew through all the mining/building content and needed story to progress to access the 3rd abandoned ruins which never seem to come. at this point i am in year 2 spring and i have been done with all that 2nd abandoned ruins offer in year 1 day 26 autumn which means i spent most of winter just running around hoping a side-quest would appear or the story would hurry up and come but it never did as from what i read i am still a few mysterious letters off from actually getting to the ruins. feels like i am being drip fed story at this point which would be fine if i was not done with everything i can do in a given day at about 3pm with plenty of time to spare.

hangouts/romance are pretty similar to what they were in portia but i appreciate the variety of characters that are available although i do miss papa bear. i thought sandy was going to be a nice replacement for papa bear for me but the sound that camel makes evoke some primordial feelings of horror in me so i avoid her usually.
one thing that i find odd is how easy it is to become a bff with heidi specifically since many of the commissions are from her so even if i do not really care about her she is my best friend stat-wise since avoiding her commissions would be hamstringing my progress too much. of course with addition of a bounty board this levels out a bit as those requests (at least in my experience) came from a variety of characters usually not requesting standard commissions like elsie for example who in my play-through appeared on standard commission board maybe twice with a incredibly simple request that yields almost no rewards.

all in all it might seem like i am airing my grievances with the game which is true but i still really like it for what it is. it may not be perfect owing to the points above or the bugs which still plague it but i do believe it is a great experience for people who liked the first game and builds upon it well. the grind feels satisfying when done in moderation and there are a lot of options for customizing your yard and house. romance options are plenty and compared to the first game there seem to be more post-marriage content.
i do hope future brings more bugfixes and even content if we should be so lucky.

p.s.
if a sequel ever comes i do hope for a different environment though as portia was also 1/3 if not 1/2 desert which i understand is a rather major plot point in the overall story but i am kind of over sand now, thanks.",9290,Mtas Predecessor Time Portia Holds True Supposed Expansion Separate Project Separate Warrant Separate Purchase Price Increased Access Purchased Initially Chosen Setting Farming Game Set Desolate Desert Setting Tall Developers Managed Introduce Mechanics Account Removing Core Original Game Mechanics Tied Story Appreciated Bit Tedious Eventually Previous Games Energy Water Requirements Trivial Simply Farming Resources Nice Game Pretty Grindy Predecessor Aspects Quick Pet Asap Ton Grindy Game Feels Depends Player Stressed Feel Worker Month Nominations Farming 3 4 Commissions Daily Blowing Stamina Abandoned Ruins Bit Repetitive Chore Feeling Started Winter 1St Avoid Recommend Engaging Game Hangouts Romance Building House Farm Feeling Squeeze Ounce Stamina Day Burn Terms Story Reached Complete Conclusion Expected Game Bring Game Contender Regard Pacing Feels Lot Progression Gated Arbitrary Amounts Days Pass Receive Email Day Story Continue 2 Days 2 Days Pass Fireside Meeting Day 2 Waiting Real Frustration Blew Mining Building Content Story Progress Access 3Rd Abandoned Ruins 2 Spring 2Nd Abandoned Ruins Offer 1 Day 26 Autumn Spent Winter Running Hoping Quest Story Hurry Read Mysterious Letters Ruins Feels Drip Fed Story Fine Day 3Pm Plenty Time Spare Hangouts Romance Pretty Portia Variety Characters Papa Bear Sandy Nice Replacement Papa Bear Sound Camel Evoke Primordial Feelings Horror Avoid Odd Easy Bff Heidi Commissions Care Friend Stat Wise Avoiding Commissions Hamstringing Progress Addition Bounty Board Levels Bit Requests Experience Variety Characters Requesting Standard Commissions Elsie Play Appeared Standard Commission Board Incredibly Simple Request Yields Rewards Airing Grievances Game True Perfect Bugs Plague Experience People Game Builds Grind Feels Satisfying Moderation Lot Options Customizing Yard House Romance Options Plenty Compared Game Post Marriage Content Hope Future Brings Bugfixes Content Lucky Sequel Hope Environment Portia 1 3 1 2 Desert Understand Major Plot Story Sand,POSITIVE,1,0,247,20,0.9250936329588015

i’ve never heard of portia, or pathea games, and stumbled onto this game google searching games like stardew valley.

but the more i played, the more i got sucked into the story.  into the idea that i am revitalizing a town.  into the character development.  into building up my workshop.
and the tons of quality of life features! the game is simple, sure, but relaxing simple, not boring simple. it's such a joy to play!

and what really speaks volumes, is the anecdote that i also played baldur's gate 3: a game i fully enjoyed and whose devs i support. but, i got bored before finishing it, and when my ""hours played"" for my time at sandrock surpassed my bg3 hours, i decided i really had to give credit where credit is due.

2023-11-17,"this is 2 games in one. i play multiplayer and single player and i'm so wonderfully surprised that there's new things to experience in both modes. multiplayer has its own missions/focus when i play with friends. when i play single player, it has it's own story and depth that is very different from multiplayer. so to me, going back and forth doesn't feel repetitive to me. 
what i loved about multiplayer that made it stand out from the crowd is that the host does not have to be online to play. anyone can hop in at anytime and that was a huge game changer for me. 

achievement hunters take note: no achievements can be earned in multiplayer. they are single player exclusive. 

as for the actual gameplay, it's been jaw droppingly sensational. i played my time at portia, and i went from not wanting to marry anyone because the character models were bleh, to now wanting to marry everyone because they're all hot!

for real though, if you played portia, this is an absolute must to play. no doubt about it. there's improvements across the board. if you've never played portia, but liked stardew or rune factory, then get this game. its not just farming. it has combat, building, workshop customization, story, collecting, etc. just about anything you'd want in this kind of game. 

there really isn't anything else i can say that other comments haven't already mentioned. it's been so fun and i will be playing many more hours. 9/10",10875,2 Games Play Multiplayer Single Player Wonderfully Surprised Experience Modes Multiplayer Missions Focus Play Friends Play Single Player Story Depth Multiplayer Feel Repetitive Loved Multiplayer Stand Crowd Host Online Play Hop Anytime Huge Game Changer Achievement Hunters Note Achievements Earned Multiplayer Single Player Exclusive Actual Gameplay Jaw Droppingly Sensational Played Time Portia Marry Character Models Bleh Marry Hot Real Played Portia Absolute Play Doubt Improvements Board Played Portia Stardew Rune Factory Game Farming Combat Building Workshop Customization Story Collecting Game Comments Mentioned Fun Playing Hours 9,POSITIVE,1,0,42,8,0.84
2023-11-17,"my time at sandrock is overall, a pretty great game that i enjoy a lot but a few issues i have make me really struggle to fight through to the bright spots. the characters and world building is great and so far there's really no end in sight for my progression, but every now and again i hit hard walls where the game requires me to wait in game time or just grind out resources to get to the next section. this especially goes with getting given quests that first require upgrading your equipment. besides that my only other complaint would be that the day cycle feels really short? it's odd that a life sim is giving me so much latent stress in having to run around and organise my time- when other games do it they tend to rely less on extremely restrictive timed quests, but sandrock has a bunch of those.

that said this games loop, nursing this town to health and the peaks at the world before are great. the romances are really cute too.",10875,Time Sandrock Pretty Game Enjoy Lot Issues Struggle Fight Bright Spots Characters Building Sight Progression Hit Hard Walls Game Requires Wait Game Time Grind Resources Quests Require Upgrading Equipment Complaint Day Cycle Feels Short Odd Life Sim Latent Stress Organise Time Games Tend Rely Extremely Restrictive Timed Quests Sandrock Bunch Games Loop Nursing Town Health Peaks Romances Cute,POSITIVE,1,0,42,8,0.84

2023-11-17,"fantastic game, i immensely enjoyed my experience playing it. while not perfect, it massively improves on many aspects from its predecessor, my time at portia (mtap), while successfully experimenting with new ideas. most of my gripes with the game are largely small, inconsequential things, though there are a couple that really stood out as being almost impressively bad for such a great game. overall i loved it and i'm crushed that my play-through has ended. 8.5/10

[h3] pros [/h3]
 - huge boost in qol from mtap; inventory management is a dream, voiced dialogue is consistent instead of feeling random, you have more freedom to explore, and so on 
 - performance; i have a gtx 1070 and an i7700k so my rig is definitely aging...however i was easily able to keep my fps at 70+. the only dips were when most/all of the cast was on screen at once and was moving around (some firesides, but oddly not an issue during any of the festivals)
 - content; i just finished all the quests and my save file reads at 144 hours. there is a shockingly gargantuan amount of content to play through. while there are always ""fetch this"" quests, very few felt like their main purpose was to add filler *coughacvalhallacough* and the main quests carried a strong identity (sandrock is a dying town and constantly goes from crisis to crisis)
 - cast/writing; i felt most of the vas did a great job and overall the writing did a great job in both conveying humor and seriousness. every quest you take with justice + unsuur is full of golden dialogue, burgess is wonderfully self-aware, and so on.
 - music; a major step-up from mtap. i mean, the musical score for mtap wasn't bad per se...well the combat music and ruins exploration music were both pretty...okay everything but the sparring music was pretty mediocre (the sparring music slapped). mtas has a much, *much* better musical score in essentially every aspect.
 - impact; you as the protagonist have a large and meaningful impact in the game. sandrock goes through a food crisis, water crisis, vegetation crisis, and you can visually see the effects they have on the town, both before and after. it made me feel, in my opinion at least, like what i was doing was...purposeful, helpful. 
 - combat; they really stepped up the combat from mtap and it is a much smoother and more enjoyable experience. there are distinct weapon types: [strike] dual blades [/strike] daggers, greatsword, [strike] insect-less glaive [/strike] spear and [strike] sns [/strike] sword + shield, along with some guns, throwables, and a couple unique weapons. 
 - quality; less of a ""pro"" and more of ""not a con"", any game where items/gear posses quality tiers is fraught with danger. sandrock does a great job with quality (aside from the names, i mean ordinary -> oustanding -> perfect -> rare doesn't make sense to me). you can refine many items/weapons/gear to raise their level at the expense of a couple gems/minerals and it never feels like a brutal grind to do so....except for any item that wants agate to level up, agate sucks to get. literally everything else though is totally fine.
 - creativity; as mentioned sandrock is built on a pitifully small oasis. it used to be lush but has been almost entirely claimed by desertification. mechanically, the game requires you to use water to ""cool"" your machines (water being one of the very few parts of the game that remained an actual obstacle throughout the play through). you are not allowed to cut down any trees within the boundaries of sandrock proper (early game finding wood is a unique challenge). these, along with taking over a dozen kinds of scrap into the new recycling machines, do a fantastic job of mixing up game play and how new tiers of materials get introduced.

[h3] neutral [/h3] 
 - skill tree; your experience gets both added to a total, overall level (health/stamina) and divided into either social, gathering, workshop or combat based on where the xp was earned. this is a mixed bag for me because the perks are very obviously either ""must-haves"" (+1 break damage, +1 daily commission) or ""super terrible"" (any of the *many* perks that give you +10% xp/chance for/etc). the extra xp is bad because....

[h3] cons: [/h3] (review too long, only showing the two that plagued me)
 - difficulty; the game is easy. no, that's not fair. it is stunningly, disappointingly, shockingly easy. i'm not asking this to be dark souls; if i wanted that i'd...go play dark souls. what i mean is that i was over-leveled (>= 8 levels above) for 90% of the game,  and massively over-leveled (>= 14) for about 40% of it. the greater the level difference, the less damage is taken/received a-la borderlands style. immunity frames when dodging are [i] incredibly [/i] generous; you have i-frames for the entire animation and a little extra, meaning you can just chain rolls for invulnerability and you can lazily roll through the few environmental obstacles thrown at you. however, as you are far above the recommended level, you won't even be dodging because you barely get hurt. the bosses are actually well designed, far better than mtap...but again, you don't need to engage in any of their mechanics you are a much higher level than they. also there are 0 attacks that cannot be avoided by simply....running in a different direction. earned experience points are also far too generous. sparring pen and the dive buzzard near the railroad tracks were the only two fights that i felt challenged; every other combat experience was a cake-walk. pathea could slash all earned xp by 25% and *maybe* you'd fall into the recommended range, but only if you never explored, did side quests or commissions. this is why 40% of the skill tree feels pointless. every perk doesn't need to be in perfect balance...but i'm already stomping everything i do not need a 10% chance to get double experience for kicking trees. gear cannot be used it you are below it's specified level but, once more, that had 0 effect on my gameplay outside of the first couple in-game weeks. sandstorms are supposed to be deadly, you are told to either stay inside or don protective gear. spoiler, it doesn't matter. wear whatever you want. the game makes some light attempts into platforming (which were done well) with the exception of the massive arrows that always tell you where to go. i could go on; suffice it to say i loved so much of the game but i never really felt ""challenged"" at virtually any point.
 - path finding. i mean wow, i was blown away by how unbelievably abysmal the path finding is. i've watched sandrock residents get stuck walking into building corners, get stuck walking into plants, decorations, each other, things that are invisible to me yet inexplicably manifest a collision box, animals, fences...if it exists in game, they've gotten stuck on it. repeatedly. in the first 3 minutes of the game you are offered a tour by the ten-year-old jasmine who after saying, ""follow me"" immediately turns around and gets stuck on a rock. the ""solution"" was to cause a character to fade out and reappear after they fail to move in their desired direction for a couple seconds. they only sometimes do that. sometimes they just give up and stand there until something breaks their error loop (if you host a party expect to talk to everybody constantly so they dont freeze in place). sometimes the pathing routes of everybody (enemies included) get shifted. now the bumble ants that are on the hill 200 feet to the east of your workshop eternally try to path into your fence. if a sandrocker has been catastrophically shifted from their normal route you may watch as they teleport back and forth between two spots (looking at your pen, rocky and krystal). your children are a complete enigma and refuse to abide by any pathfinding laws. good luck trying to change that diaper

2023-11-17,"while it's not perfect, my time at sandrock does a great job of balancing all the core things you're looking for in a farming sim (plus some unique and surprising things from other genres) and is worth its full price for the quality and amount of gameplay you're getting.

more than it's predecessor, this game does justice to its setting and theme - it's hundreds of years after the apocalypse occurred in near-future world, and society's rebuilt using the scraps, so you've got a charming mix of old west cliches, retro-futuristic salvaged technology, and eclectic plotlines that include cold war politics, the threat of mutant sentient animals, and the collapse of the environment. aesthetically pretty much everything has improved from the character models to the environmental design. 

one of the most interesting things this game does is up-end the typical farming sim tropes to fit its setting and story. when you start, instead of cutting down countless trees or laying out plots of crops, you're salvaging scrap wood, weeds and dewdrops, always at risk of running out of water. then you're diving into ruins for copper and old circuit boards, and eventually you're fighting mutants and robots for advanced computer chips and high-quality alloys, building back an environment where you can safely cut down trees and plant massive fields without guilt. it's not really a factory game and there aren't a ton of interactive tools/machines to build to make things easier, but there's still something satisfying about building up the machines and seeing the improvements you've made around town.

characters aren't that deep but they've done a good job not only on improving the visual complexity of their design but also adding some interest to their story-lines. it's legitimately hard to choose which marriage candidate to focus on as there's a lot of good options for both men and women. there's some of fun twists and character development you wouldn't normally see in a farming sim, though overall the plot and dialogue is very pg. there's not much in the way of major character relationship drama or more mature/realistic themes.

later on the game can get kind of slow as you wait until the next day to continue quests, and the need for money/resources/relationship points disappears. in the options menu, there's an option to speed up the passage of time during the day up to 3x, or slow it down significantly, so you don't feel rushed while collecting resources, or bored waiting for machines to complete. this feature is honestly one of the best things in the game as it gives you a ton of control over the pacing.

the combat isn't great - it's pretty easy and attacks/hitboxes feel a bit awkward - but it's more complex than stardew valley or dinkum, and has some interesting mechanics and boss fights; it's most comparable to rune factory. you're not playing a farming sim because you expect it to be dark souls.

if like i do, you consider stardew valley and rune factory be the (recent) defining games of this genre, my time at sandrock is definitely up there in the top 5.",10875,Perfect Time Sandrock Job Balancing Core Farming Sim Unique Surprising Genres Worth Price Quality Gameplay Predecessor Game Justice Setting Theme Hundreds Apocalypse Occurred Future Society Rebuilt Scraps Charming Mix West Cliches Retro Futuristic Salvaged Technology Eclectic Plotlines Include Cold War Politics Threat Mutant Sentient Animals Collapse Environment Aesthetically Pretty Improved Character Models Environmental Design Game Typical Farming Sim Tropes Fit Setting Story Start Cutting Countless Trees Laying Plots Crops Salvaging Scrap Wood Weeds Dewdrops Risk Running Water Diving Ruins Copper Circuit Boards Eventually Fighting Mutants Robots Advanced Chips Quality Alloys Building Environment Safely Cut Trees Plant Massive Fields Guilt Factory Game Ton Interactive Tools Machines Build Easier Satisfying Building Machines Improvements Town Characters Deep Job Improving Visual Complexity Design Adding Story Lines Legitimately Hard Choose Marriage Candidate Focus Lot Options Women Fun Twists Character Development Farming Sim Plot Dialogue Major Character Relationship Drama Mature Realistic Themes Game Slow Wait Day Continue Quests Money Resources Relationship Disappears Options Menu Option Speed Passage Time Day 3X Slow Feel Rushed Collecting Resources Bored Waiting Machines Complete Feature Honestly Game Ton Control Pacing Combat Pretty Easy Attacks Hitboxes Feel Bit Awkward Complex Stardew Valley Dinkum Mechanics Boss Fights Comparable Rune Factory Playing Farming Sim Expect Dark Souls Stardew Valley Rune Factory Defining Games Genre Time Sandrock 5,POSITIVE,1,0,42,8,0.84

2023-11-16,"[h2] multiplayer feedback for my time at sandrock [/h2]

firstly, we want to express our appreciation for the unique multiplayer experience you've introduced in my time at sandrock. after investing over 50 hours+ into the game, my wife and i compiled our thoughts and feedback, focusing primarily on the multiplayer aspect. it's important to note that our feedback pertains exclusively to multiplayer, as we have yet to explore the single-player mode.

[b] let's delve into the areas that could use improvement: [/b]

[h3] 1. lack of freedom in a server-based world [/h3]
the introduction of a server-based world is both a blessing and a curse. while the ability to play even when the host is inactive is commendable, it restricts player freedom. in contrast to the multiplayer mechanics of [b]stardew valley[/b], where an account-based server offers players the freedom to modify the game using mods, console commands, and more, [b]my time at sandrock[/b] a sandbox multiplayer game focus falls short in this regard.
[list]
[*] comparison with stardew valley multiplayer

stardew valley allows mods and extensive customization, adding costumes to npcs, changing npc portraits, incorporating extra heart events, enhancing ui, introducing new characters, implementing console commands, even freezing time and more. the only limitation is the necessity for the host to be active, a trade-off that hasn't posed a significant issue, since i can just turn on my pc (i'm the host) and let them do whatever they want in the farm, even if my character faints due to lack of sleep, there are no adverse consequences or losses incurred because of the mods.

[*] impact on gameplay experience

the current server-based setup in [b]my time at sandrock[/b] detracts from the immersive storytelling experience. if one player is offline, progressing through quests and other activities becomes challenging due to the accelerated passage of in-game time. this time constraint induces stress rather than fostering a relaxing gameplay environment. the server is very strict when modifying our own world.
[/list]

[h3] 2. time progression does not stop in multiplayer mode even if you are alone. [/h3]
[list]
[*] a notable drawback of the server-based approach is that in multiplayer worlds with only one active player, time relentlessly marches on regardless if you are in menu mode, inventory, etc. this poses a challenge for players who meticulously plan and min-max their activities, especially when friends are offline. try to implement a ""private/account based"" multiplayer world, allowing players to host their own servers, would offer a solution to this predicament and empower players to play the game on their terms. ( some might say, stop playing and wait for your friends to get online ). 
[i]that would counter the fact that the multiplayer server-based is [b]useless[/b] since we have to wait for everyone to be online, right?[/i]
[/list]

[h3] 3. achievements and milestones in multiplayer [/h3]

[list]
[*] adding achievements to multiplayer mode seems to be a missed opportunity. while the game already features milestones, incorporating a system to track personal achievements and synchronizing them with steam achievements would enhance the multiplayer experience. if some achievement is only accessible in singleplayer, then we would have another reason to play the singleplayer mode.

[*] yes, you can play multiplayer mode for 500+ hours, complete everything you need and you still have 0/60 achievements. 
not cool.
[/list]

[h3] 4. shared storage challenges and quest completion [/h3]

[list]
[*] the existing shared storage system, offering capacities of 80(?), 120, and 300 at levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively, introduces significant challenges, particularly during the [b]early and mid-game phases[/b]. this challenge is accentuated in multiplayer scenarios where multiple players contribute to the shared storage. once the shared storage reaches its capacity, we're compelled to resort to ""personal storage,"" limiting access for other players.

[*] the inconvenience arises when different players hold distinct resources, gone offline then other players need those items for quests. they will have to farm again, since time does not stop. unlike the seamless, automatic quest item retrieval feature present in single-player mode, the multiplayer experience introduces additional complexities, requiring deliberate coordination among players to ensure efficient quest completion.
[/list]

[h3] final note [/h3]

personally, i've experienced almost no bugs, aside from a random npc walking through a cut-scene (why burgess why), and events and quests seem to be triggering properly.  i had one instance where a story quest messed up the trigger event for a festival, but the game didn't actually skip it-- it just moved the actual festival events to two days later in-game.

2023-11-15,"he's a 10, buuuuut.....

overall this is a pretty good game, and there's a lot of fun to be had in it. despite my negative review, i will keep playing it. and if you like games like stardew valley, you'll almost certainly like this one. the basic gameplay loop is fine - great even, if a little stale after awhile. and the story - likewise very enjoyable! the characters are, for the most part, unique and interesting and generally quite humorous. overall i should be able to recommend this game. so why don't i?

it's the little things. lots and lots of little things. for me, i play a game like this as a kind of escapism. i lose myself in the story and in getting to know the cast of characters - however cheesy it all might be. and in general, this game provides that better than most you might play, without the heaping dose of grim reality and tragedy you'll get from something like baldur's gate 3. it's a happy escapist fantasy. until you encounter (not bugs, because i did not encounter any that were not ultimately harmless and funny) some of the poorly or lazily implemented features.

obviously, you can date and marry and have kids with a good number of the characters. this is to be expected of this genre, and the process of getting to know these characters, through a variety of quests and events both focused on them and not, is quite a bit of fun. you will probably become quite invested in them. until you finish their content and they become hollow and uninteresting shells. they don't do or say anything new or interesting past a certain point - which is to be expected, but it is exacerbated by other things as i will point out. the dating/hangout mini game becomes a chore because after a couple of those you will have exhausted the dialogue with a given character - and that dialogue will not update even if you are actively in a relationship or married to the character. 

to make matters even worse, the story will not take any of this into account. whether or not you are dating a given character, or married to them even, will never come up outside of the one off wedding event or when talking to that character directly to get one of their canned lines of repetitive marriage dialogue - which are cute sure enough, but you can only hear them so many times before they lose all their charm. 

for a truly horrible example of how absurd this can get, at one point during the story you are to venture into a toxic environment full of extremely hostile enemies that want to kill you. all well and good, yea? well, if you are married to one of the characters involved, that character could be pregnant at the time of this quest. this does not come up...so your fun little happy escapism is irreparably ruined because the game is now sending your pregnant wife into a life and death situation because the smallest effort was not made to actually integrate the relationship and marriage system into the story in any way. 

and speaking of pregnancy, it's hilarious - from  a male character's perspective, i do not know how it differs if you play a female character and are the one to get pregnant. you will be teleported one morning to the hospital to see your spouse holding the baby, you will be prompted to name it, pick what the child will call you, and then you will be returned home. your spouse will be gone, already off following their preset schedule (which does not change even when you marry them by the way, they still follow the same routine as they do by default, except when it is interupted by the tasks you can choose to assign them). when you catch up to them...not a single damn mention of the baby they just pushed out. the entire system is barely implemented and it's kind of ridiculous. harvest moon 64 almost 30 years ago had a more robust and interesting system of marriage and children. what they've cobbled together here has the bones of something perfectly adequate, great even, but there is basically no connective tissue to bring it all together. 

overall, the game is quite good for what it is, and despite my negativity there is much to enjoy. but this is a life sim game, and the quite frankly pathetic implementation of some very important systems to the success of a game in that genre - dating, marriage, and children - leave a massive gaping hole in it. fixing these things would not even require a massive revamp of the game. just some basic time and care to make these choices feel as impactful as they should. lockout marriage until a point in the story where it cant create awkward situations, for example. implement new dialogues to accurately reflect relationship changes - despite all the voice acting a significant amount of the dialogue is unvoiced, so it is not even a question of needing to record new lines. just write more dialogue and shove it in there.",11594,Buuuuut Pretty Game Lot Fun Negative Review Playing Games Stardew Valley Basic Gameplay Loop Fine Stale Awhile Story Enjoyable Characters Unique Humorous Recommend Game Lots Lots Play Game Escapism Lose Story Cast Characters Cheesy Game Play Heaping Dose Grim Reality Tragedy Baldur Gate 3 Happy Escapist Fantasy Encounter Bugs Encounter Ultimately Harmless Funny Lazily Implemented Features Marry Kids Characters Expected Genre Process Characters Variety Quests Events Focused Bit Fun Invested Finish Content Hollow Uninteresting Shells Expected Exacerbated Dating Hangout Mini Game Chore Couple Exhausted Dialogue Character Dialogue Update Actively Relationship Married Character Matters Worse Story Account Dating Character Married Wedding Event Talking Character Canned Lines Repetitive Marriage Dialogue Cute Hear Times Lose Charm Horrible Absurd Story Venture Toxic Environment Extremely Hostile Enemies Kill Yea Married Characters Involved Character Pregnant Time Quest Fun Happy Escapism Irreparably Ruined Game Sending Pregnant Wife Life Death Situation Effort Integrate Relationship Marriage Story Speaking Pregnancy Hilarious Male Character Perspective Differs Play Female Character Pregnant Teleported Morning Hospital Spouse Holding Baby Prompted Pick Child Returned Spouse Preset Schedule Change Marry Follow Routine Default Interupted Tasks Choose Assign Catch Single Damn Mention Baby Pushed Entire Barely Implemented Ridiculous Harvest Moon 64 30 Robust Marriage Children Cobbled Bones Perfectly Adequate Basically Connective Tissue Bring Game Negativity Enjoy Life Sim Game Frankly Pathetic Implementation Systems Success Game Genre Dating Marriage Children Leave Massive Gaping Hole Fixing Require Massive Revamp Game Basic Time Care Choices Feel Impactful Lockout Marriage Story Create Awkward Situations Implement Dialogues Accurately Reflect Relationship Voice Acting Dialogue Unvoiced Question Record Lines Write Dialogue Shove,POSITIVE,1,0,42,1,0.9767441860465116
2023-11-15,"this game is silly and story wise you shouldnt take it too serious. it has it's own charms but it might be too overwhelming for people who havent played my time at portia before. im close to end game and im having tons of fun, definitely 8.5/10 or even more in my standards. it's pretty much up there for a relaxing life sim games and this game is unique on it's premise.

anyways there is some things that needs to be solved still

- cutscenes are sometimes weird especially when using my own costumes.

- cutscenes are still buggy as hell. fps drops, my character being stuck and i have to alt+f4 and various weird stuff

- please have an option to abandon/restart missions. one example i had was during one of the festivals in the same day as a main mission. the npc then made me insta lose during the event because he had to tp somewhere else.

- horseriding/mounts (although better than during the beta) still have some weird clipping problems at times

2023-11-13,"it's worth the money. 6/10 rating for now

to sum it up: combat and exploration sucks, but the rest of the game is pretty good and makes up for some of it.

crafting and expanding your workshop is very fun as well as most of the campaign. relationships with the npcs is also good. the town is beautiful.

the bad part is combat, which lacks any kind of challenge and doesn't feel good. you level up your character by doing pretty much anything and this automatically increases your damage significantly. this meant that once i started the first combat oriented mission of the campaign, i was already 10 levels above the enemies and it felt very boring. aside that, i think the main issue is that combat feels very floaty and has no weight. the sound effects animations when hitting enemies are lackluster, making it feel very boring to hit enemies.

stages for exploration are very repetitive copy paste of enviroments and lack any true interesting parts or puzzles.

inventory management is also another small issue, since there's tons of different items, it gets hard to organize them all, specially playing on controller.

overall it's a pretty decent game, with much potential if they fix combat and level scaling.

2023-11-14,"let's just get the important bit out of the way first: this is my 2023 game of the year. it was only a matter of when the game would come out of early access to claim its crown. since this game hit on nov. 2, i nominated it for the steam award.

now then, on to why this game is, as of this writing, my 6th most-played title in terms of hours on my steam account.

it's basically everything from my time at portia, but improved upon and made better in every possible way. the world is bigger, the building mechanics refined to a visible-from-space shine, the action rpg story fleshed out in a way that makes it the primary driver of gameplay rather than purely a framing device.

indeed, this is less a cozy game with action-rpg elements and more a reimagining of the action rpg formula where cozy game mechanics are the primary driver of progression. the genres blend seamlessly in a way that they never have before—looking at you, horizon zero dawn and forbidden west and every ubisoft game, where the crafting is tedious and feels unnecessary.

but at the same time, this game also has a cozy soul. if you're played any harvest moon-like, the life sim elements are exactly what you want them to be and then some. building relationships with villagers, romance, family life, it's all there with plenty of choices and some remarkably well-written relationship and character backstory dialogue. there are just so many ways to get a villager's friendship up compared to, say, stardew valley's more traditional talk-and-gift approach, and with the anti-frustration feature of not having to talk to every villager every day just to keep their relationship level from backsliding.

speaking of anti-frustration features, there are plenty more in this game as well. none of the main story quests are timed; complete them at your leisure. get overleveled if the combat's not your strong suit. rush the main story quests to unlock more of the crafting recipes if that's your jam. speedrunners and challenge runners? go to town, the game's got plenty of measurable ways to keep score. 

almost none of the sidequests are timed. if you unlock them too fast, as happens when you're powering through the main quest and hitting every character's sidequest trigger faster than you can bang them out, well, take a step back and take your time. the devs listened to players during the early access stage of the process and took the most common frustration—players felt rushed—out of the game. you want to complete them as fast as possible, nothing's stopping you. but it all fits in with the overarching theme of well-camouflaged accessibility that never feels like it's being dumbed down.

as for the action and combat in the action rpg, well, the devs know they're not from software. this isn't going to challenge anyone with a firm grounding in action games. you can overpower just about anything in the game because the devs have consciously avoided the bethesda syndrome of level-scaling enemies. well, with one exception—going too far afield in a sandstorm is going to surprise you the first time you run into high-level versions of basic enemies—but even that is a smart stylistic choice that makes sandstorms feel appropriately dangerous and threatening for a game set against the backdrop of a desert environment with a strong ""green aesop"" running through the main story.

is the game perfect? well, no, no game is perfect, not even games that are otherwise among the greatest of all time (i say this as someone who loved everything about red dead redemption 2 except for the on-rails quest design, for example.)

for one thing, the fishing minigame is one of the weakest i've seen in this genre. it's simplistic and repetitive and offers almost no challenge and very little reason to even engage with it beyond a couple of cooking recipes. this is a shame, especially since portia's fishing minigame was quite fun and other games like stardew, animal crossing (and dinkum, which cribs heavily from it), and even red dead 2 have great outdoorsman-style fishing gameplay.

in addition, there are a couple of dungeons in the midgame that have a jarring tonal shift toward platformer gameplay. thankfully the devs refined it a bit after its initial introduction; jumps are more forgiving, there's plenty of ""coyote time"" with ledges, and there's the option to skip the trickiest segments if you fail them enough times, but for a game that otherwise has good dungeon design, there's a heavy ""why, devs?"" when playing the two dungeons in question.

but those are minor quibbles in a game that is otherwise the absolute apex of the cozy game genre with one heck of a story rpg to go with it.

instead, i got a game where i don't have to farm if i don't want to (except for some quests but. no daily watering anyway, so that's dope). the story itself has been super enjoyable, and fun. i didn't think it'd ramp up like it did, but serious, emotional moments would pop up out of nowhere, and it felt like such a treat. i can do basically anything, and at my own pace. there's very little the game stopped me from doing that wasn't story related. it's fun to have all the options in the world, and have none of them be a bad on.

2023-11-10,"""my time at portia"" was an apparently simple game, and yet it provided a surprisingly deep experience.
after playing for a good while, it's obvious the developers at pathea games took everything they've learned from the project and put it into ""my time at sandrock"".
this new title has been improved over the original in every way possible: graphics, artstyle, combat, animations, activities, characters, story... the list covers literally every single aspect of the game, and even if there's still some rough edges here and there, they're very minor and don't hinder at all the quality of the product.

the game combines life-style (housing, crafting, resource gathering, bonding with other characters...) with action/adventure gameplay (exploration, rpg elements, dungeons, boss fights...). all the while, the city of sandrock grows and develops over time and as the story goes forward, with your contribution.
there's also a dedicated multiplayer mode, focusing exclusively on everything revolving around managing your workshop (no story progression, unfortunately, but the fact it's there as an option to have fun with friends in a game that doesn't really need multiplayer, is already more than enough).

if you're in for a fun, hopeful, wholesome and pleasant adventure filled with likeable characters in a vibrant, living world that makes you truly feel a part of it, then there's no reasons not to give this game a try. 
you'll be genuinely suprised by seeing how much care, affection and attention to details have been put into crafting this little gem and what it has to offer.
the part where you're a builder, tasked with gathering resources and building things is truly just part of the tip of a huge iceberg.

even at full price, it's well worth the money.",15092,Time Portia Simple Game Surprisingly Deep Experience Playing Obvious Developers Pathea Games Learned Project Time Sandrock Title Improved Original Graphics Artstyle Combat Animations Activities Characters Story List Covers Literally Single Aspect Game Rough Edges Minor Hinder Quality Product Game Combines Life Style Housing Crafting Resource Gathering Bonding Characters Action Adventure Gameplay Exploration Rpg Elements Dungeons Boss Fights City Sandrock Grows Develops Time Story Contribution Dedicated Multiplayer Mode Focusing Exclusively Revolving Managing Workshop Story Progression Option Fun Friends Game Multiplayer Fun Hopeful Wholesome Pleasant Adventure Filled Likeable Characters Vibrant Living Feel Reasons Game Genuinely Suprised Care Affection Attention Details Crafting Gem Offer Builder Tasked Gathering Resources Building Huge Iceberg Price Worth Money,POSITIVE,1,0,58,16,0.7837837837837838

i actually enjoy this game ~ its fun to play with your partner and ofc for me its good because it has a level system and has dungeons.
the multiplayer still has some small bugs but the devs actually care about this game and keep fixing stuff.

-> important fix that should happen is the micro frame drop whenever you pickup loot from either mines or chest.

2023-11-09,"this is a tremendously satisfying game about harvesting materials, crafting, completing tasks, and helping a town prosper.  it's easy to see just a few hours in just how much thought has gone into the systems.  there's plenty to do to fill a day, and new main and side quests pop up on the regular to keep you moving forward.  the game respects your time with convenient tooltips, tutorials, and things like paying to expand your bags directly from your inventory, or being able to complete objectives with materials in your storage.

the social aspect of the game is also surprisingly strong.  the characters are often interesting and the writing is genuinely funny.  there's an interplay of story and gameplay as certain events will cause prices of goods to fluctuate or prompt a community response.  there are mini-activities to do with townsfolk to increase affinity and neat holidays.  there's also lore bits here and there that i did not expect to be as poignant as they are. 

there is combat, and it is fine, but i do not think that is the main draw.  my only complaints would be nitpicks.  the random character customization produces some nightmarish results, and the house expansion system is somewhat fiddly.

2023-11-09,"      as someone who has played their fair share of life simulation games, with the variety of animal crossing, stardew valley, and palia to be some of the main ones, this game comes very close to beating them all. i was thrilled to find out that this game was going to have multiplayer in it, seeing as my time at portia does not have multiplayer, which heavily influenced my choice to buy it or not.

      this game can be buggy at times and while i only have a 980 gpu, i can run this game at medium settings and it still looks pretty decent. i did not play the early access, only full release, and i can say that there seems to be quite a bit of content to this game. this game is very multifaceted with social/town, farming, combat, mining, building, animal, and pet aspects, with that just being what i have discovered with 19 hours of playing. i play with 2 other people and the game runs fairly well. i have only encountered a few lag/server sync issues between other players, a few ui glitch errors, and 1 wonky combat fight with an elite. but beyond those few things i haven't seen much to stop me from wanting to play this game as much as possible. 


[h3] pros [/h3]
- lots of content (19 hours in and it feels like i have so much more to do)
- decent price (i was gifted the game but seeing the price for how fun this game is seems fair)
- fun with friends
- multiplayer actual works
- leveling up feels important and good
- missions feel good and not like leg work (you can visually see the work you put into the town)
- tons of townspeople
- combat feels good and fun
- character customization (you can super customize your character with sliders)
- gear (weapons and clothes have stats that can help you with gathering and fighting)
- weather (the weather events in this game are really great. so far i have seen rain, sandstorm, and summer 
   heat. i am waiting to see snow in this game as of yet.)
- server stays up (no matter who owns the town, i am able to play on my friends server even after the 
   person who made it has left. this is a big game changer for me seeing as you don't have to stop playing on 
   one server because the host has left or crashed.)

[h3] cons [/h3]

- desync/stutter issues (i have only had this happen 2-3 times playing so far and it is fixed by a simple return 
  to lobby and rejoin.)
- ui machine icons disappear (i have only seen this once and it was fixed by rejoining the lobby)
- forced personal chests (i mention this because it was a pain to have only so much room in the one 
   community chest you get at the start of the game. you can upgrade it, but i would like to have the option 
   to share my personal chest contents if i choose to. and not have to run back to home every time someone 
   needed something.
- combat (could use a little work on hit registration and how your character can go through the enemies 
   while swinging your weapon)
- accidental playable character requests (in the game there is an option to talk to real people and play a 
   mini-game called critters. it feels a bit annoying at times when you are trying to interact with machines or 
   doors and other playable characters get the input over the item/machine/door. could be quite annoying if 
   playing with a lot of people in one area but not too bad overall.)

2023-11-08,"this is one of the best life simulator games i have ever played, hands down! it does have a few minor problems but they're barely notable and the pros here far outweigh any cons.

what i think...

+ pros +
++++++++
+ beautiful visuals and characters
+ astounding game mechanics
+ tons and i do mean tons to do for hours on end
+ awesome crafting system
+ awesome building/upgrade system
+ easy to understand and play
+ challenging enemies
+ lots of quests and side missions
+ mail system that actually makes sense and lets you respond
+ town news that makes sense, you can subscribe to get updates on things happening in town
+ finally, a town that feels and looks legit, lots of stores, an arcade, and more
+ lots of mini games and events
+ lots of glorious cutscenes
+ feels very realistic in a lot of ways
+ gameplay draws you in a lot
+ lots of collectibles
+ lots of areas
+ singleplayer and multiplayer
+ lots of replay value


- cons -
----------
- can start to feel rather mundane and repetitive doing the same thing over and over at times
- multiplayer starts of with no house and a lot of missing buildings, this makes absolutely no sense
- controls in multiplayer are by default different than singleplayer, this too makes absolutely no sense
- player water tower to refill with water should have a visual meter to indicate water in it since it's extremely annoying just to have to open it up to check ever time and that makes it difficult to know if you're running low or not while busy with other town commisions and such. a simple visual meter on the side of the tank would make life so much better.
- a lot of the pop-ups such as hints/tips from quests and wandering around show up during cutscenes and can easily be missed as they don't stay there long so you might miss something important and thats very frustating


= verdict =
==========
= my time at sandrock takes everything about the first game and makes it even better plus a little more! there is literally so much detail and realism packed into this wonderful stylized game to keep you busy with the game for hours on end and when you think it stops no it doesn't you can take things on again pretty much through continued multiplayer! its a wonderful game with so many great gameplay machanics and you'll never want to put it down! i highly recommend it! i really hope to see this game come to android as well like the first one did! i would buy it on mobile in a heartbeat! thanks devs for making this amazing game!

2023-11-08,"this game deserves more attention! although my time at portia was a rough-edged gem that i still enjoyed quite a lot, sandrock greatly improves on its predecessor in almost every way. the town and characters are brimming with personality, the story is great, the quests feel meaningful, and overall the game just feels good to play. the quality-of-life improvements over the original are significant, especially regarding storage. combat still isn't perfect, though it's significantly better this time around. there is just so much to do in this game, and the loop is very addictive and fun!

if you never played portia, it's a bit hard to describe this game. it's not a ""farming game"", although you can do a bit of that. rather, you are a builder. you salvage, mine, gather, and refine materials, and use those to make and build whatever the town's inhabitants request. there is a heavy focus on characters, relationships, and story, in addition to the surprisingly interesting crafting system. the requests and commissions range from small items, to pieces of furniture, to useful structures that actually get placed permanently in the environment. you, your home (inside and out), and your yard are all highly customizable. almost everything you wear actually shows on your character, too, which is pretty neat!

the desert setting is more than just a backdrop, too. farming is a challenge. sandstorms are a threat. in order to keep your crafting machines running smoothly, you must keep them fueled, clean of sand, and cooled with water. collection and conservation of water is important in this game, not only as a theme, but also in practice. it should be tedious, but somehow it's not, i think due to just how well they implemented this ""you are living in a desert"" theme overall.

the only two negatives i can think of are a bit of lag as things load in when transitioning areas, and the often charmingly-awkward voice acting. neither of these are enough to even dampen my experience, though. i truly hope this is only the second in a long series of my time games!",15199,Game Deserves Attention Time Portia Rough Edged Gem Enjoyed Lot Sandrock Greatly Improves Predecessor Town Characters Brimming Personality Story Quests Feel Meaningful Game Feels Play Quality Life Improvements Original Storage Combat Perfect Time Game Loop Addictive Fun Played Portia Bit Hard Game Farming Game Bit Builder Salvage Gather Refine Materials Build Town Inhabitants Request Heavy Focus Characters Relationships Story Addition Surprisingly Crafting Requests Commissions Range Items Pieces Furniture Structures Permanently Environment Yard Highly Customizable Wear Character Pretty Neat Desert Setting Backdrop Farming Challenge Sandstorms Threat Crafting Machines Running Smoothly Fueled Clean Sand Cooled Water Collection Conservation Water Game Theme Practice Tedious Implemented Living Desert Theme Negatives Bit Lag Load Transitioning Charmingly Awkward Voice Acting Dampen Experience Hope Series Time Games,POSITIVE,1,0,42,4,0.9130434782608695

with the building aspect easier to manage, once the money starts coming in the water ration part becomes easier as well to the point i almost forgot about it. they also made quite a few changes from the beta side to 1.0 and it's been a nice surprise to find these little extras as i play through the main story line. 

they made sure that you are never truly stuck in your progress as if you can't reach the new mine area yet, check the junkyard and recycle the scrapes. you will soon be getting the last materials needed for the current main quest project. as to the ever present sandstorms, well they improved on that as well but i wouldn't spoil on how as it's nice to found out in the game, just a side note the enraged beasts do level with your character so they will still present a challenge.

2023-11-10,"this sequal to my time at portia happens to be as good as, if not better than my time at portia.
the game has tons of improvements, tons of new features and mechanics, tons of quality of life additions, and more that were not in my time at portia.
furthermore it has a much more detailed and exquisite crafting system, farming system, construction system, and combat system, all of which is easy to learn because it wasn't made very complex.
there is also tons of in game tutorials and means to look back at past information, so the player will not get lost as easily as they did in my time at portia.
this game is a massive improvement in many ways. perhaps the only complaint the player could ever have is water management, and even then, for a player that is willing to learn and understand water conservation, a player will learn how to easily manage their water reserves with time and never run out of water (which will take a long time for people who have extreme difficulty with extremely basic management skills and extremely basic learning skills).
in any case, i have been playing this game since closed beta, i was a kickstarter backer, and i think the full release is infinitely superior to the beta, and it is way better than my time at portia, though it is reasonable to understand that the water management system is treated as the reason many people say this game is worse than my time at portia... it is probably the only downside to this game.

2023-11-02,"an excellent game.

i took a chance on it during ea since it was nothing like the typical game i would play, (survival, mmos, shooters, etc.) and totally loved it.

the cartooniness can be misleading, it's actually quite a complex game, sort of a mashup of a rpg, singleplayer open world, farming/builder game with interesting npcs and relationships with them.

i see some power-gamer's whining about not having enough stamina to mine the entire world in a day, but they simply have not learned how to play yet.

the key to pacing your game play is based on how quickly you advance the main story quest line. meaning slow down!
if you want to mine more, build, explore, talk to npcs, and feel like you need to catch up, simply don't do the main story quests for a few days, or as long as you want. you control it completely. do not rush the main story quests.

power gamers have to rush everything. this is not that type of experience. slow down and enjoy the journey.",7446,Excellent Game Chance Ea Typical Game Play Survival Mmos Shooters Totally Loved Cartooniness Misleading Complex Game Sort Mashup Rpg Singleplayer Farming Builder Game Npcs Relationships Power Gamer Whining Stamina Entire Day Simply Learned Play Key Pacing Game Play Based Advance Main Story Quest Meaning Slow Build Explore Talk Npcs Feel Catch Simply Main Story Quests Days Control Completely Rush Main Story Quests Power Gamers Rush Type Experience Slow Enjoy Journey,POSITIVE,1,0,63,15,0.8076923076923077
2023-11-02,"it's a good game, runs smooth, story's about as good as a chinese company can make and then half-bake into english. gameplay loop is satisfying as well, with either farming and gathering or combat, crafting, building. the world is... well, about as nice as a desert can be, and you can make it a bit less... desert-y by decorating, at least your plot of land, your house, your farms. character customization is..... decent. base models are expandable enough, plus you can swap out clothes pretty easily, if not a little... grindy, and there's a pretty decent variety as far as things go, nothing groundbreaking but at least nice enough.
however.
we all knew the price was going to hike up a bit on full release, but in addition to that, they waited until after release to drop all the dlc, a very disappointing half-step that the players definitely should have known better about before the game released. if i'd known there was gonna be dlc aafter release, i would have thought twice about even getting it. however, honestly it's still a really solid package, and some dinky cosmetics aren't going to really make or break your gameplay in most cases.
the game is probably a 7/10, it would have been an 8, however i'm not one to take this game's early-access transition dlc hat-trick lightly.
if you like farming and gathering, decorating and just general life-simmery, i would recommend you get it at a discount, it's 40 usd on release but i would get it for 30 at most.

if you're like me, you probably got roped into this game after finishing stardew valley. probably itching for the same type of chill, farming and building type of vibes.

instead, what i received was a compelling storyline, great voice acting, and extremely likeable and all around unique characters, as well as an ending that left me wanting for more. not going to spoil anything, but the twists in this game keep you hooked for what's to come after every main quest.

beyond that, mtas is one of the few games where you look back at what you've done and felt like you've made an impact. pieces of your work are sprinkled in full view all over the town, and your relationship with npcs reflect that as well. you'll get that sensation that your builder has truly grown into someone remarkable, worthy of their title by the game's end.

sure, the game might have a tad few bugs lying around, even after release, but honestly the fact that the story was good enough to push me through does spell out something for the writing in this game.

2023-11-25,"this game started off so well, really seeming to be portia but better. but the more i play it, the more issues i'm having. i've got a lot of unconnected thoughts, so i'll list the good and bad then put a summary at the botom.

[b]good:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]oustanding character design, personality, and development.[/b]
seriously some of the most lovable npcs in gaming. everyone has a unique and very well developed personality, with their own backstories and character arc.
[*][b]interesting world with a great concept to base the game off of.[/b]
sandrock has a well thought out history, and you have the goal of showing up while it's getting run down and on the decline, and having to turn it around to make it prosper. you do this by building new things to make the town grow, by uncovering lost technology from the old world long destroyed by the day of the calamity, and by fighting off the growing desert.
[*][b]lots to do.[/b]
farm, build, grow your workshop, decorate, connect with the townspeople, play minigames, catch fish, explore ruins, fight monsters etc. you know what to expect from games like this, and this game manages to include a wide variety of content better than most.
[*][b]humour.[/b]
there's a lot of funny jokes, silliness, nice references, and all sorts that will make you smile.
[*][b]coziness.[/b]
the game is so damn pleasant. there's so many issues with it which i'll get to, but despite them all i still found myself having a great time up until towards the end. it's just such a nice world to be in, it's so lovely learning about all the characters and gradually improving the town and your own workshop. it's really nice.
[*][b]immersion.[/b]
bit of a weird one, but this is something this game does well i think. you can get so absorbed and lost in this world. i love games that have the ability to make me forget the real world and just live in this virtual one for a week or two. this game nailed that. the fact i have 130 hours played after only starting 12 days ago shows what i mean, lol.
[/list]


[b]bad:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]performance.[/b]
the game takes a solid 5-10 minutes to load. this is a constant issue. going from one place to another has a very long loading screen, and even when it finishes loading, very few entities have actually loaded. buildings, menus, npcs, and objects all take an extra minute or so to load. sometimes they just don't load at all, and you'll have to restart the game. i've never had so much issues with load times in a game.
[*][b]the game is extremely grindy and tedious.[/b]
i'm 130 hours in and not even made it halfway towards finishing some things. i'm not exaggerating. i'm still not even done with the story, and from what the achievements tell me, neither are 99% of the people playing the game. collecting resources is extremely repetitive and slow, so is crafting, so is befriending people, and fighting, and pretty much every aspect of the game. everything is painfully longwinded and drawn out, taking a ridiculously long time for little payoff.
[*][b]length.[/b]
i'm never one to complain about how long a game is, the more there is to do the happier i am. this game is the one exception to that. all the story points feel so disjointed. it could end at so many points, but it has to add a new twist or an entirely new and unrelated story every time, which adds an extra 30 hours to the game each time. why has the story gone from developing this town, to catching a bandit, to [spoilers]rescuing a rat princess, to fighting in a war[/spoilers]. it strays so so far from the starting point that it's hard to stay interested, and that brings me to my next point.
[*][b]story.[/b]
it starts off so good, but what on earth happened. at some point you need to stop and question if what you're doing makes sense, and this game just doesn't. the game throws plot twist after plot twist at you, without putting much thought into any of them. none of them make sense, none of them are good ideas, it just feels like it's elongating this already immensely long game for no actual benefit.
[*][b]quality.[/b]
the game is very janky, which i personally think is fine for the most part, but it's worth mentioning. combat has you zipping around erratically, you can walk up almost vertical walls, mounts controls awfully, camera movement during dialogue is very strange, every cutscene is broken if there's a sandstorm going on, sandstorms don't actually do anything, there are almost no quality of life features, lots of invisible walls, there's not much attention to detail, and many features of the game feel very barebones. there's a lot more i could mention but this is already too long. the game just feels very much like they set their ambitions higher than they're able to reach. the fact i've got myself softlocked twice, and just downloaded a week 2 update which fixes 90+ bugs says a lot about the game. it just isn't well made.
[*][b]multiplayer[/b]
when this game was announced, it was planned to have multiplayer. not long before the release of the game, they decided to change that, after already receiving backing and early access purchases from people who were promised the game would have multiplayer. the game now has the most barebones and pointless multiplayer you can ask for, with no story or any of what makes the game fun.

the game is generally good, the story works well and flows okay for the most part, mechanics make sense, though some aspects will require a look at the in-game help as the first descriptions may not give all the information you need...

with 200 hours at the time of writing, i have 'completed' the game and enjoyed my time in sandrock...

but it's the cosmetic dlcs, available on, or shortly after, release, that total more than one and a half times the price of the base game...  some of the dlcs come in three parts - each one giving a costume for four of the characters (and three addition recolours of the same costume.)  why does it take three dlcs just to give the main npcs a beach outfit each?

it's not enough to turn my opinion negative, but certainly has made it less of a positive one...

i really liked my time at portia and played it a lot when it came out, but kinda fizzled out with interest the more i advanced in that game. i was excited to give my time at sandrock a chance once i heard about it. i waited until the day it officially came out of beta because i didn't want to burn out of content. i bought the entire dlc at the time to help show support and because you can never have enough outfits imo. 

i only ran into 2 issues so far in my 55 hrs of game play. i posted about them in the bug section and i got a prompt response from the devs each time that they were fixing the issue. both are fixed very quickly. i think each time i posted, it was fixed in the next patch which was only a day or 2 since i commented. both were also kinda minor issues that had a work around if you put thought into it. 

if the fact that's it's still kinda fresh out of beta and has a ton of patches, i can honestly say that you won't regret the purchase. i've been burned by beta and fresh out of beta games before. this is not that. like i said above i only ran into 2 issues that were fairly minor and they were fixed asap. i've enjoyed the heck outta this game and can't wait to see more. the casual farming dating sim aspect brought me in and the story has me hooked.",9744,Tldr Love Relaxing Exploration Farming Kinda Casual Games Dialog Fun Missions Endless Rush Complete Timed Quests Plenty Time Finish Imo Mush Time Actual Challenge Game Fun Relaxing Story Engrossed Time Portia Played Lot Kinda Fizzled Advanced Game Excited Time Sandrock Chance Heard Waited Day Officially Beta Burn Content Bought Entire Dlc Time Support Outfits Imo 2 Issues 55 Hrs Game Play Posted Bug Prompt Response Devs Time Fixing Issue Fixed Time Posted Fixed Patch Day 2 Commented Kinda Minor Issues Kinda Fresh Beta Ton Patches Honestly Regret Purchase Burned Beta Fresh Beta Games 2 Issues Minor Fixed Asap Enjoyed Heck Outta Game Wait Casual Farming Dating Sim Aspect Brought Story Hooked,POSITIVE,1,0,139,6,0.9586206896551724

2023-11-22,"i can't even really describe why i like this game i just really do. currently sitting at level 49, no idea how close i am to completing the story.
this game feels like what i wanted out of stardew valley. everytime the game seems to calm down and you feel like you'll get bored of the resource farming the game throws some new character/questline/situation/area at your head which encourages you to farm new materials, build new stuff or upgrade existing structures. its an amazing game to kill a few hours after a long day at work to rewind and do dumb stuff.
the only negative thoughts i have about the game are that the max bag capacity of 280 is too small if you are planting a ton of trees/crops as well. food items don't restore enough stamina to make it worth cooking and that i cannot invest or upgrade the ""by the stairs"" shop so the shopowner has more then 2000 gols.
i love the monthy python reference or snowwhite's with ged or the mobile suit's. probably missed a few as well.
the resource grinding and sometimes slower days might be the only thing stopping players from enjoying this game. the combat system could use some overhaul as well, haven't really tried out the building aspect of your own home but will do that as soon as i have some more space to relocated animal farms and crops.",9290,Game Sitting Level 49 Idea Close Completing Story Game Feels Stardew Valley Everytime Game Calm Feel Bored Resource Farming Game Throws Character Questline Situation Head Encourages Farm Materials Build Stuff Upgrade Existing Structures Amazing Game Kill Hours Day Rewind Dumb Stuff Negative Game Max Bag Capacity 280 Planting Ton Trees Crops Food Items Restore Stamina Worth Cooking Invest Upgrade Stairs Shop Shopowner 2000 Gols Love Monthy Python Reference Snowwhite Ged Mobile Suit Missed Resource Grinding Slower Days Stopping Players Enjoying Game Combat Overhaul Building Aspect Space Relocated Animal Farms Crops,POSITIVE,1,0,247,20,0.9250936329588015

the game takes a fun twist on the normal cozy life sim by placing the player in the role of the towns builder. your goal is to help the townspeople with various tasks whilst also helping sandrock to grow back in to the prospering metropolis it once was. with fun twists to the story, amazing town events, smooth combat and a huge range of items to build and customize i am sure this will be a hit for anyone who enjoys life sims and doesn't mind that they won't be as much of a farmer. i would def put this in a category for coziest game of the year",9290,Recommend Fan Time Portia Failings Original Analyzed Resolved Addition Time Series Game Huge Dynamic Cast Lots Fun Interact Villagers Game Pretty Mechanics Smoothly Issues Close Tool Npc Allowing Quest Resolved Rounds Conversation Mildly Frustrating Intended Feature Bug Game Takes Fun Twist Normal Cozy Life Sim Placing Player Role Towns Builder Goal Townspeople Tasks Helping Sandrock Grow Prospering Metropolis Fun Twists Story Amazing Town Events Smooth Combat Huge Range Items Build Customize Hit Enjoys Life Sims Mind Farmer Def Category Coziest Game,POSITIVE,1,0,247,20,0.9250936329588015

i am a long time fan of games of this genre but what sets this game apart from all the others for me is how beatifically voice acted this game is, it helped to make the characters feel more alive compared to the usual text boxes, choices you make with your choices of text also impact what the characters reaction are which also helped me to feel more involved with the story. this alongside the beautiful 3d graphics has made this one of my favourite games in this genre so far.

should they have included multiplayer instead of focusing on another quality single player game? no. 
are they sadly making a mobile game for the next installation. yes and booooo.
if you loved portia, you will love sandrock hands down. it's a formula they should stick with. it's got the cozy life sim, but you're more of a hero and there's some action/adventure elements. this is not another farm sim. it's in it's own category for me. 
downsides are the factory is now terrible - they plan to fix it.
building system isn't great (your house etc.). 
quests often overlap - sometimes with meetings and holidays, making you miss out on something. -again, they are working on this.
voice actors for surprise characters are horrendous. (english)
some things feel unfinished. (i.e. taking commissions for corps with no increase in rank)
multiplayer - took away from development in what they are good at imo. should have left it out.

upside is, more of the same formula. build, commissions, a battle, story, references new ways to play, new people to get to know, etc.

the devs clearly love this game, and they plan to have post launch support well into 2024.

2023-11-21,"[i]my time at portia[/i] was a real surprise for me when i first played it. i'm pretty sure i got it in a bundle. it looked like someone had repurposed the assets of a korean mmo from 2010. but it turned out to be an unexpectedly feature rich game with an interesting post-apocalyptic worldbuilding, gameplay with genuinely novel ideas in combining the day-to-day work cycle and socializing of [i]harvest moon[/i] with softer factory game mechanics and combat, and just a good amount of content that was fun despite the jank.

[i]my time at sandrock[/i] takes all the good ideas of its predecessor which felt accidentally good at many times, and elevates them so you can make no mistake that pathea are actually a really talented and hardworking company that knows what they're doing. is it free of jank? no, not really. but it's so chockful of good things that even the jank becomes charming. it has a great, interesting story full of characters with vibrant personalities and not the paper-thin cutouts you get in [i]stardew valley[/i]. the world of the setting is so fully realized despite the series' cartoony nature and you feel excited to explore and learn about it. it is genuinely laugh out loud funny at many points, and genuinely emotional at others. i have to give it up for the vas who don't seem like professionals but are still giving their best. the building gameplay while its core loop is the same, sees a lot of qol improvements. the combat is more dynamic and offers a bit of challenge though it's still on the casual side. there's so many small charming details too, like when you go on dates in-game, they put in an animation where your significant other holds your hand. they didn't have to do that. it has no mechanical value. it's just cute and it makes you feel good.

stuff like that is why i think most of all, what the game nails is that it makes it good to be in sandrock, and to see sandrock grow. everyone who plays games for long enough understands the feeling where a place in a game becomes like a real place we have visited and been in, and we feel a sort of nostalgia seeing it. i think sandrock will feel that way to many people playing the game, it's such a wonderfully crafted setting, and it really fulfills the promise of the genre of ""life sim"" where you can take a break from reality and live somewhere else for a little while. i'm not even done with the main story. i restarted with 1.0 to experience it as intended since in beta lots of the quests squished together in buggy ways as they were implemented, but i feel glad to have done that. this is gonna be a game i will have good memories of and consider a favorite years from now.

2023-11-24,"[h2]ahoy![/h2]

this be ye local piratical reviewer comin' to tell ye if my time at sandrock be worth your precious doubloons or whether she be sent down to the briny depths!

i want to tell ye first, i've played the predecessor my time at portia to completin' and will be makin' some comparisons between 'em, i'll also be splittin' me thoughts into ayes 'n nays for easy readin'

[h3]ayes[/h3]

[b]a real sense o' progression[/b]
my time at sandrock (mtas) nails that sense of progression that my time at portia (mtap) pioneered. as ye be making ye adventures, ye'll be changing sandrock, from buildin' cranes te' fixing the hydrogel, expanding the yakmel network to more serious ventures like plantin' forests in the desert and building the road to portia. 

for each quest chain ye complete, you'll get reminders just how far ye've came. making ye feel apart of the world, and ultimately it's my most favourite draw to mtas.

[b]craftin'[/b]
goin' hand in hand with makin' ye changes in sandrock, the crafting is an improvement upon mtap. ye have a bounty o' machines to be gettin' ye buildin. most days ye'll be havin' machines runnin' all day pumpin out manner o things for ye designs. ingots, screws, slabs, everything to be gettin' everythin' built. occasionally, you'll feel overwhelmed but honestly, i felt that it feed it the hectic job that is bein' a builder in mtas. ye'll eventually condense this into ye crown jewel near the end, the almighty factory.

[b]exploration[/b]
the world of sandrock is huge and thar be plenty to see and dive. you'll be prowlin' through dangerous ruins, fighting robots and mobs for parts ye need for your builds and ye'll be spendin' a fair chunk o' ye time in the abandoned ruins, bringin' up various ores and relics to both smelt and reassemble. i've got no complaints.

[b]the characters[/b]
in this pirates honest opinions, the characters in mtas shine far brighter then those in portia. every character has a small chain that details there daily lives and a insight to their personality. it added that depth to life and some reason to care about the characters compared to portia, the massively expanded amount of quests featured in mtas, really helped in this situation.

[h3]nays[/h3]

[b]combat[/b]
thar has been a' few changes to combat, however, it still be simplistic. you'll be finding yourself usin' the same strategies ye found in portia. ye'll be dodging the choreographed events, going in to break' em and then just devastating 'em. it's the same ole' song and dance. it be worse with guns, ye'll whip your pistol o' rifle and just stun lock and break your enemy in place, making short work out most o' everything. disappointin' really.

[b]performance[/b]
this be nay gay breakin' but ye'll certainly notice it in ye adventurin'. mtas doesn't play aswell as portia, ye have pop in galore, especially o' anything ye've added to the world via the quests. the game chugs in the town itself and has random slow downs in various places. it can detract from ye' experience.

the small positive is for me, is that the game has mostly been light on bugs and pathea has been on the ball since release. 

[b]dlc practices[/b]
i hated to be addin' this one but £4.49 for costumes for 4 characters and putting the favourites separate in individual packs is a practice that belongs in davey jones locker. either bundle them together for a tenner or reduce the price of the individuals. currently it looks a cash grab and add as a tarnish to this shining treasure.

[h3]conclusion n' scoring[/h3]
mtas is a large game and it's hard to condense everything inte' a few paragraphs. it's a massive improvement on mtap. if ye loved that game, ye'll be right at home here. a no brainer for ye doubloons.

if ye the kind of sailor that loves a solid sense o' progression with an in-depth crafting system, memorable characters and a massive chain of quests to go on and doesn't mind some minor annoyances and lacklustre combat system. ye'll definitely find some good sailing 'ere.

i give mtas a solid 8.5/10 gold doubloons. a massive improvement over portia if not marred by spotty performance and cheap dlc tactics.",9744,H2 Ahoy H2 Local Piratical Reviewer Comin Time Sandrock Worth Precious Doubloons Briny Depths Played Predecessor Time Portia Completin Makin Comparisons Em Splittin Ayes Nays Easy Readin H3 Ayes H3 Real Sense Progression Time Sandrock Mtas Nails Sense Progression Time Portia Mtap Pioneered Adventures Changing Sandrock Buildin Cranes Te Fixing Hydrogel Expanding Yakmel Network Ventures Plantin Forests Desert Building Road Portia Quest Chain Complete Reminders Feel Ultimately Favourite Draw Mtas Craftin Goin Hand Hand Makin Sandrock Crafting Improvement Mtap Bounty Machines Gettin Buildin Days Havin Machines Runnin Day Pumpin Manner Designs Ingots Screws Slabs Gettin Everythin Built Occasionally Feel Overwhelmed Honestly Feed Hectic Job Bein Builder Mtas Eventually Condense Crown Jewel Almighty Factory Exploration Sandrock Huge Thar Plenty Dive Prowlin Dangerous Ruins Fighting Robots Mobs Builds Spendin Fair Chunk Time Abandoned Ruins Bringin Ores Relics Smelt Reassemble Complaints Characters Pirates Honest Opinions Characters Mtas Shine Brighter Portia Character Chain Details Daily Lives Insight Personality Depth Life Reason Care Characters Compared Portia Massively Expanded Quests Featured Mtas Helped Situation H3 Nays H3 Combat Thar Combat Simplistic Finding Usin Strategies Portia Dodging Choreographed Events Break Em Devastating Em Ole Song Dance Worse Guns Whip Pistol Rifle Stun Lock Break Enemy Short Disappointin Performance Gay Breakin Notice Adventurin Mtas Play Aswell Portia Pop Galore Quests Game Chugs Town Random Slow Detract Experience Positive Game Light Bugs Pathea Ball Release Dlc Practices Hated Addin 4 49 Costumes 4 Characters Putting Favourites Separate Individual Packs Practice Belongs Davey Jones Locker Bundle Tenner Reduce Price Individuals Cash Grab Add Tarnish Shining Treasure H3 Conclusion Scoring H3 Mtas Game Hard Condense Inte Paragraphs Massive Improvement Mtap Loved Game Brainer Doubloons Sailor Loves Solid Sense Progression Depth Crafting Memorable Characters Massive Chain Quests Mind Minor Annoyances Lacklustre Combat Sailing Ere Mtas Solid 8 5 Gold Doubloons Massive Improvement Portia Marred Spotty Performance Cheap Dlc Tactics,POSITIVE,1,0,139,6,0.9586206896551724

of everything, though, i think the music in this game is the best part. i would totally just sit and listen to the soundtrack all day, if i needed something to help relax.

i liked portia, and i liked this game. just finished it! lots to do, the story is much more significant than i expected. thumbs up.

...with caveats. i had hoped that this time around we'd be able to avoid some of the pitfalls that portia had, and there were exotic new pitfalls to enjoy as well.

[h2]spoilers ahead, sorry. skip to conclusion for non-spoilery assessment[/h2]

[h3]the good[/h3]
[list]
[*]unsuur
[*]lots of story content, more than portia
[*]you get to feel epic as the townies come to respect you
[*]the civil corps of sandrock acknowledges you as an honorary member instead of pretending for the entire game that they are stronger than you in spite of your combat prowess like the civil corps of portia did
[*]didn't rely pretty much at all on any of the old workshop machines from the old game, and new models where there was overlap
[*]had a much more effective environmental message, where portia kind of deliberately put you at odds with the environmentalists in the game while trying to talk about the importance of environmentalism
[*]some (some) of the voice acting was pretty good
[*]i liked the weapon variety and specialization you could do through knowledge points
[*]did a decent job of making it so you could stop hunting for older, low-level ore and minerals while still making you track down new ores and occasional rarities like engines and stuff.
[*]datable men in this game are way hotter than in portia. so are the women, but the glow-up award goes to the guys. much better fleshed out personalities across the board too.
[*]i really liked hanging out and dating being instant instead of scheduled for a specific time the next day.
[/list]

[h3]the bad[/h3]
[list]
[*]arvio
[*]nearly every model that's not a permanent feature of the landscape takes a long time to load in
[*]quite a bit of the voice acting and sound design is somewhere between questionable and bad
[*]pacing is often weird. see section below.
[*]dating and hanging out still isn't fun
[*]there is no contest whatsoever in the builder rankings. i beat yan in year one without trouble, and in year two mi-an didn't come close. i could have done just one commission a day and i still would have been miles ahead. i expected mi-an to surge ahead to at least claim some yan-level numbers once yan wasn't taking credit for all her work, but she just wasn't remotely a threat.
[*]there was not nearly enough variety in the commissions. never-ending metal ingots, metal plates, stone slabs, petrified wood planks and sticks, and canvas were my reward for climbing to five stars. why aren't people commissioning more, you know... built stuff?
[*]what the hell happened to the factory? in portia it had an awesome animated interior and dedicated upgrade options. in sandrock it's an ugly living room with all your machines crammed into it as cramped as you can manage. in portia it worked with the automated half of your assembly station, but in sandrock you wish you could just delete your assembly station entirely because you'll never use it again.
[*]i never once used a powerstone of either grade. i found it impossible to run out of dregs.
[*]i love merle, but i wanted a goat with rambo's horns.
[*]there's a whole upgrade in the abandoned ruins goggles to let you see the outline of the items you scan. only problem is every scannable item is smaller than the diamond indicator so you'll never actually see the outline of anything. portia had no such issue.
[*]sandrock fails in multiple instances to teach you about functions of the game. i never once learned to use a camera, so i had a whopping zero photos at the end of the game. i was made aware of the existence of parties thanks to the resources i had to make them go over well, but i only learned from the end credits that i was supposed to purchase and set up a banquet table to unlock this feature. i discovered that many of the datable npcs have outfit options in the social menu. i never found out how to make those happen. the fashion show seemed like the time for that to unlock, but the outfits were never made purchaseable, despite barber guy's enthusiasm about selling them in his dialogue. i thought maybe it was dlc, but it turns out it's not, so how was that meant to unlock? maybe after you marry them? nope. still no idea.
[*]i gave grace a custom pet name to call me when we got married. she just called me sugar instead.
[*]i am genuinely unsure if there are enough small items to donate to the museum to successfully fill the small item slots available
[*]the house builder interface is janky as hell. sometimes you just have to quit and go back in to get anything done as various items refuse to bring up their interaction options, become unmovable, become unresizable, or just plain disappear because of an errant click. was it a workshop machine? then don't bother checking your inventory or the ""workshop machine"" menu on the builder interface, because it's now in your mailbox. so better get your ass back home to get that item and then head back to the house builder thing to try and remember what you were doing.
[/list]

pacing issues
[list]
[*]i earned a greenhouse before i was ever able to develop a single tile of biocrust naturally, despite nonstop gardening starting the moment gardening was available. even without the greenhouse, the main story gifted me enough biocrust to make generating it manually a pointless feature.
[*]i was excited to get my max-level spear, but i earned the laser sword before i could make one and it was the indisputable optimal choice, rendering my knowledge points in spears worthless
[*]in portia the final build, a plane, blindsides you with a sudden need for truckloads of crystals you never thought to harvest before and makes you take in-game weeks just waiting for them to spawn so you can finish the quest. sandrock's elegant answer to this problem is to make the final build embarrassingly easy to complete. you'll probably have it finished in an afternoon with materials you had laying around. please, by all means, send me on a couple days of fetching to get the parts i need for this once-in-a-game build. they're never going to ask for another one, so make them unique items that i need to fight some boss monsters to obtain or something. i don't know, but ""a single expedition's worth of nanomaterial scrap and poplar wood and (checks notes) an item made a tiny amount of copper and bronze"" can't possibly be the best answer.
[*]in both portia and sandrock, the factory is a double-edged sword. it feels awesome to unlock godmode in your workshop, but you'll never have to think meaningfully about any commissions or build quests again. that's the day you go from bustling builder to rare material scavenger, and there's no going back, really. it was also too cheap and easy to have a factory in this game. couple grand, you're good to go. at least in portia you had to gather a mess of expensive materials and pony up the cash.
[*]you'll have the max-level workshop equipment by about the halfway point of the game. upgrading feels nice, so it's sad when this goes away so soon.
[/list]

[h3]conclusion[/h3]
this is a fundamentally fun game that, like its predecessor, is deeply flawed. it has heart, but it feels unfinished in a way i know they're not going to fix. i had hoped portia would serve as a learning experience that would lead to sandrock being far more optimized out the gate. instead, it's genuinely unclear if they learned much of anything from portia's issues.

would i buy a new entry in this series in the future? well... probably. because they did at least prove they have some fun new ideas that do iterate successfully on the ""my time at"" formula. but at this point pathea is cementing itself in my head as a studio with a lot of muscle in the ideas department, but anemic in the polish department. the public is growing weary of studios that can't release a finished game.",9123,H1 H1 Portia Game Finished Lots Story Expected Thumbs Caveats Hoped Time Avoid Pitfalls Portia Exotic Pitfalls Enjoy H2 Spoilers Skip Conclusion Spoilery Assessment H2 H3 H3 List Unsuur Lots Story Content Portia Feel Epic Townies Respect Civil Corps Sandrock Acknowledges Honorary Pretending Entire Game Stronger Spite Combat Prowess Civil Corps Portia Rely Pretty Workshop Machines Game Models Overlap Effective Environmental Message Portia Deliberately Odds Environmentalists Game Talk Environmentalism Voice Acting Pretty Weapon Variety Specialization Knowledge Decent Job Hunting Level Ore Minerals Track Ores Occasional Rarities Engines Stuff Datable Game Hotter Portia Women Glow Award Guys Fleshed Personalities Board Hanging Dating Instant Scheduled Specific Time Day List H3 Bad H3 List Arvio Model Permanent Feature Landscape Takes Time Load Bit Voice Acting Sound Design Questionable Bad Pacing Weird Dating Hanging Fun Contest Whatsoever Builder Rankings Beat Yan Trouble Mi Close Commission Day Miles Expected Mi Surge Claim Yan Level Yan Credit Remotely Threat Variety Commissions Metal Ingots Metal Plates Stone Slabs Petrified Wood Planks Sticks Canvas Reward Climbing Stars People Commissioning Built Stuff Happened Factory Portia Awesome Animated Interior Dedicated Upgrade Options Sandrock Ugly Living Machines Crammed Cramped Manage Portia Automated Assembly Station Sandrock Delete Assembly Station Powerstone Grade Impossible Dregs Love Merle Goat Rambo Horns Upgrade Abandoned Ruins Goggles Outline Items Scan Scannable Item Diamond Indicator Outline Portia Issue Sandrock Fails Multiple Instances Teach Functions Game Learned Camera Whopping Photos Game Aware Existence Parties Resources Learned Credits Supposed Purchase Set Banquet Table Unlock Feature Discovered Datable Npcs Outfit Options Social Menu Happen Fashion Time Unlock Outfits Purchaseable Barber Guy Enthusiasm Selling Dialogue Dlc Meant Unlock Marry Nope Idea Grace Custom Pet Married Called Sugar Genuinely Unsure Items Donate Museum Item Slots House Builder Interface Janky Quit Items Refuse Bring Interaction Options Unmovable Unresizable Plain Disappear Errant Workshop Machine Bother Checking Inventory Workshop Machine Menu Builder Interface Mailbox Ass Item Head House Builder Remember List Pacing Issues List Earned Greenhouse Develop Single Tile Biocrust Naturally Nonstop Gardening Starting Moment Gardening Greenhouse Main Story Gifted Biocrust Generating Manually Pointless Feature Excited Max Level Spear Earned Laser Sword Indisputable Optimal Choice Rendering Knowledge Spears Worthless Portia Final Build Plane Blindsides Sudden Truckloads Crystals Harvest Game Weeks Waiting Spawn Finish Quest Sandrock Elegant Answer Final Build Embarrassingly Easy Complete Finished Afternoon Materials Laying Send Couple Days Fetching Game Build Unique Items Fight Boss Monsters Single Expedition Worth Nanomaterial Scrap Poplar Wood Checks Notes Item Tiny Copper Bronze Answer Portia Sandrock Factory Double Edged Sword Feels Awesome Unlock Godmode Workshop Meaningfully Commissions Build Quests Day Bustling Builder Rare Material Scavenger Cheap Easy Factory Game Couple Grand Portia Gather Mess Expensive Materials Pony Cash Max Level Workshop Equipment Halfway Game Upgrading Feels Nice Sad List H3 Conclusion H3 Fundamentally Fun Game Predecessor Deeply Flawed Heart Feels Unfinished Hoped Portia Serve Learning Experience Lead Sandrock Optimized Gate Genuinely Unclear Learned Portia Issues Entry Series Future Prove Fun Ideas Iterate Time Formula Pathea Cementing Head Studio Lot Muscle Ideas Department Anemic Polish Department Public Growing Weary Studios Release Finished Game,POSITIVE,1,0,147,16,0.901840490797546

i have played both multiplayer and single player and this is my thoughts.

the multiplayer i love, my partner and i play it together and we really enjoy the sandbox type game play and it plays out as a prequel to the main story of sandrock and i really like that. 

the single player is crazy good, the story is enticing, the characters quirky and interesting. the grind is real but that is one of the things i enjoy about these types of games. though tbh i have never really had any difficulty in building the items required for the story, i think there is an appropriate level of challenge but it is not impossible",9290,40 Hours Game Played Multiplayer Single Player Multiplayer Love Partner Play Enjoy Sandbox Type Game Play Plays Prequel Main Story Sandrock Single Player Crazy Story Enticing Characters Quirky Grind Real Enjoy Types Games Tbh Difficulty Building Items Required Story Level Challenge Impossible,POSITIVE,1,0,247,20,0.9250936329588015

2023-11-15,"i largely enjoyed my time at sandrock, with some big caveats, but for the most part the 40 hours (give or take) i spent with the game were quite positive!

the game keeps you pretty busy throughout by pouring the objectives and big milestones on you. i always felt like i was chasing some far away goal and always had stuff to do and people to talk to. there's no shortage of content here, and even though i stopped at the 40 hr mark, i could have easily done another 40 with the amount on offer. 
the social system is great. it's a grind, but it's great. you can go on dates with your townspeople and i feel like the dates are actually thoughtful - you don't just ply them with gifts and everything works out - you have to plan what you want to do according to what the npc likes to do.

i loved the setting - it's such a unique setting for a life sim and it actually plays directly into the game play. it isn't just lip service. the town relies on a meagre supply of water and it *isn't* freely available so you have to plan everything around having a supply of water to power your machines. they even add layers of complexity later on as story twists put a real squeeze on the towns water supply. that's really cool. you also can't just fell every tree in sight as the environs rely on them to maintain water. so you are really scavenging from wrecks and debris and it lends the game this real desert junkyard vibe that i think works well. 

on the flipside, though, i find the art style, characterisation and dialogue a lot more cringey than in other management/life sim games. i get that a lot of these games are meant to be wholesome and kindly, it's a big part of why the genre has the appeal it has, but it doesn't work here. in stardew valley, it's wholesome but genuine. here in sandrock, everything is sickly sweet. people treat you with fawning praise that comes off as either blindly naive or painful disingenuous and as a result, i didn't really feel totally connected to any of the characters as much as i did in, say, spiritfarer, which in terms of characterisation is best in class. so that sucks, because *quite* a lot of the game is spent talking to people. and it's a lot. a lot. of really cheesey cringey dialogue. 

this game is also afflicted with the baggage of the genre: grinding. i really feel like the end game *has* to involve some kind of automation because there's only so much joy that can be wrung from grinding for resources and plying them into machines and manually making *everything* every single time. at the start, this is a genuinely fun pursuit as you always have goals to aim for, but the pursuit soon becomes your cage and before you know it, the game is playing you when it should be the other way around.

generally speaking, despite these negatives, i feel like sandrock is a great time if you know what you're getting into, but a lot of the genre's contemporaries have done this before, and maybe even better.",11594,Enjoyed Time Sandrock Caveats 40 Hours Spent Game Positive Game Pretty Busy Pouring Objectives Milestones Chasing Goal Stuff People Talk Shortage Content Stopped 40 Mark Easily 40 Offer Social Grind Dates Townspeople Feel Dates Thoughtful Ply Gifts Plan Npc Likes Loved Setting Unique Setting Life Sim Plays Game Play Lip Service Town Relies Meagre Supply Water Freely Plan Supply Water Power Machines Add Layers Complexity Story Twists Real Squeeze Towns Water Supply Cool Fell Tree Sight Environs Rely Maintain Water Scavenging Wrecks Debris Lends Game Real Desert Junkyard Vibe Flipside Art Style Characterisation Dialogue Lot Cringey Management Life Sim Games Lot Games Meant Wholesome Kindly Genre Appeal Stardew Valley Wholesome Genuine Sandrock Sickly Sweet People Treat Fawning Praise Blindly Naive Painful Disingenuous Result Feel Totally Connected Characters Spiritfarer Terms Characterisation Class Sucks Lot Game Spent Talking People Lot Lot Cheesey Cringey Dialogue Game Afflicted Baggage Genre Grinding Feel Game Involve Automation Joy Wrung Grinding Resources Plying Machines Manually Single Time Start Genuinely Fun Pursuit Goals Aim Pursuit Cage Game Playing Speaking Negatives Feel Sandrock Time Lot Genre Contemporaries,POSITIVE,1,0,42,1,0.9767441860465116

the game makes me feel like i'm always in a race against time, on the clock tick tock gotta go fast, but after a while i realized it really dsnt matter if you just chill out and take your time. missing some of the daily missions is perfectly fine and just exploring at your own pace is not a problem at all. of course, the nature of the daily cycle mixed with the daily contracts adds this feeling of being in a rush to do everything you can do within a single day. 

the combat and gearing is very simple but its still a part of the game i did enjoy. don't expect like difficult combat, but its still satisfying to see my damage grow as i get levels and upgrade my gear to purple + highest item level in the machines.

i hit max character level and max level workshop in multiplayer and i still have places to explore, missions to complete and new things to craft/build.",16806,Game Honestly Enjoyable Played Access Game Release Impressed Content Compared Enjoy Building Crafting Gathering Game Feel Race Time Clock Tick Tock Gotta Fast Realized Dsnt Matter Chill Time Missing Daily Missions Perfectly Fine Exploring Pace Nature Daily Cycle Mixed Daily Contracts Adds Feeling Rush Single Day Combat Gearing Simple Game Enjoy Expect Difficult Combat Satisfying Damage Grow Levels Upgrade Gear Purple Item Level Machines Hit Max Character Level Max Level Workshop Multiplayer Explore Missions Complete Craft Build,POSITIVE,1,0,56,7,0.8888888888888888

2023-11-21,"a worthy, quality sequel. “my time at portia” was a decent game, but “my time at sandrock” takes nearly all the ideas to the next level, making it hard to go back to the previous game.

the game does a good job of combining lore and gameplay elements, which is quite unusual and pleasant for the genre. thanks to the fact that the player has a goal from the very beginning, and the set of actions is mostly based on how the world is structured, the game feels cohesive. for example, the ability to plant crops is not just given because it’s necessary, but due to certain plot events, and it’s given by an npc. the process of growing plants, although a bit tedious and requires excessive micromanagement, is still justified by the game world: water is scarce, the soil isn’t the best, so you have to put in the effort.

there’s a lot of content in the game, it unfolds quite slowly, but that’s not a downside, because there’s always something for the player to do. both the main quest and all the side quests may not be tarantino-level in terms of execution, but they’re adequately composed, always capable of keeping the game interesting.

the game has a few downsides:

[olist]
[*]clunky controls coupled with a rather primitive camera behavior. for example, you need to press a separate button for aiming, after which the camera sensitivity seems to increase due to the change in the camera’s anchor point.
[*]extremely sparse, quite primitive animation. it reveals the budget nature of the project and hinders immersion.
[*]an excess of invisible walls, especially in the local dungeons. it feels like the authors set up the walls after prototyping the levels, but forgot to put up boxes and other obstacles blocking the path in some places or placed them too far away.
[*]useless multiplayer. there is a cooperative mode in name, but it’s very primitive and boring. the authors chose an earlier time period of the city when it was under construction, were too lazy to attach a decent plot, and just allowed several players to mess around in it at the same time.
[/olist]

overall, my time at sandrock is a worthy representative of the sandbox genre. the gameplay, except for the combat component, is decent, the plot is also decent, the graphics are decent, albeit with a specific stylization. against the backdrop of glitchy, unfinished games, this one looks pretty good.",9327,Worthy Quality Sequel Time Portia Decent Game Time Sandrock Takes Ideas Level Hard Previous Game Game Job Combining Lore Gameplay Elements Unusual Pleasant Genre Player Goal Set Actions Based Structured Game Feels Cohesive Ability Plant Crops Plot Events Npc Process Growing Plants Bit Tedious Requires Excessive Micromanagement Justified Game Water Scarce Soil Effort Lot Content Game Unfolds Slowly Downside Player Main Quest Quests Tarantino Level Terms Execution Adequately Composed Capable Keeping Game Game Downsides Olist Clunky Controls Coupled Primitive Camera Behavior Press Separate Button Aiming Camera Sensitivity Increase Change Camera Anchor Extremely Sparse Primitive Animation Reveals Budget Nature Project Hinders Immersion Excess Invisible Walls Local Dungeons Feels Authors Set Walls Prototyping Levels Forgot Boxes Obstacles Blocking Path Useless Multiplayer Cooperative Mode Primitive Boring Authors Chose Earlier Time Period City Construction Lazy Attach Decent Plot Allowed Players Mess Time Olist Time Sandrock Worthy Representative Sandbox Genre Gameplay Combat Component Decent Plot Decent Graphics Decent Albeit Specific Stylization Backdrop Glitchy Unfinished Games Pretty,POSITIVE,1,0,165,11,0.9375

the story is great. i don't care if you saw the twists coming; it is the *telling* of the story that was done well. character designs improved massively, especially for bachelor npcs. voices range from excellent to decent to what-happened-to-your-microphone.

some characters are really good. some are really bad. some i would be okay leaving to hungry wolves. if there was a button to eliminate mi-an i would press that button with zero hesitation; embarrassingly poor characterization of a rival type that otherwise would have had so much potential. i gave her venom every day just so we wouldn't be buddies. on paper, at least. mi-an does not respect your boundaries on that regard.

there are a lot of weird animations in this game. weird facial expression. weird cock-eyed npcs. but it's really still a good game. music is a treat. i find myself humming the seasonal themes. romance in here is one of the greats; i hope this will remain their forte in future games.

2023-11-17,"my time at sandrock is a charming, cozy and relaxing game with an intriguing storyline, a diverse and lovable cast of characters, and an addictive gameplay progresion loop that sees you and your workshop grow, alongside with the community of sandrock.

the art style, music and excellent writing has made this cozy game into a very immersive experience. i went in not knowing how much of a focus the game had on story, and was very pleasantly surprised at the writing, direction, length and depth of the story and world building.

as a complete game with a satisfying amount of content, this game would easily take about 100+ hours to complete for the average person.

pros:
(+) excellent story line that kept me motivated to see what happens next. a lot of effort has been put into the story and set pieces, more so than similar life sim / farming games.
(+) addictive gameplay progression loop and pacing of progressing through the main story, upgrading your tools and workshop, and making lasting changes to sandrock.
(+) well written characters that you learn a lot about and grow to love / care for through your time with them. characters each have their backstories, motivations and distinctive personalities which contribute to the social feel of sandrock, as well as the narrative.
(+) wide variety of customization options for player character appearance, and workshop (including housing, furniture, plants and decorations).

subjective:
(=) movement feel a bit ""weightless""; there is no momentum to movement.
(=) resource gathering may feel grindy at times especially if you try to optimize stamina usage each day, but is over-all well balanced if you pace yourself through daily commissions and exploring the sidequests.
(=) the mini games are very charming, and add a lot to the festivals / events in the game's calendar. however, they may be more simplistic than one would expect.

cons:
(-) several minor bugs at release, personally have yet to experience anything gamebreaking. the devs are actively working on addressing known issues.

overall, an excellent game. i'm very much looking forward to what pathea games has in store next!",10875,Time Sandrock Charming Cozy Relaxing Game Intriguing Storyline Diverse Lovable Cast Characters Addictive Gameplay Progresion Loop Workshop Grow Community Sandrock Art Style Music Excellent Writing Cozy Game Immersive Experience Knowing Focus Game Story Pleasantly Surprised Writing Direction Depth Story Building Complete Game Satisfying Content Game Easily 100 Hours Complete Average Person Pros Excellent Story Motivated Lot Effort Story Set Pieces Life Sim Farming Games Addictive Gameplay Progression Loop Pacing Progressing Main Story Upgrading Tools Workshop Lasting Sandrock Written Characters Learn Lot Grow Love Care Time Characters Backstories Motivations Distinctive Personalities Contribute Social Feel Sandrock Narrative Wide Variety Customization Options Player Character Appearance Workshop Including Housing Furniture Plants Decorations Subjective Movement Feel Bit Weightless Momentum Movement Resource Gathering Feel Grindy Times Optimize Stamina Usage Day Balanced Pace Daily Commissions Exploring Sidequests Mini Games Charming Add Lot Festivals Events Game Calendar Simplistic Expect Cons Minor Bugs Release Personally Experience Gamebreaking Devs Actively Addressing Issues Excellent Game Pathea Games Store,POSITIVE,1,0,42,8,0.84

2023-11-15,"this is a hard one to judge. this game is a culmination of both what i love and hate about modern video games.

pros:
* the game loop isn't bad. it's similar to the predecessor and they didn't modify it much from there. 
* the characters in the game are pretty decent and distinct. some of them develop in unexpected ways which is neat.
* there ""larger than life"" events that do better than what its predecessor had.
* the conveniences later on are better than what was in its predecessor (with unfortunate caveats due to bugs).
* a cozy quality-of-life game.

cons:
* this game is buggy to a point i'm not sure how the hell it was released like it was. some of the bugs are similar to what i saw in early versions of its predecessor game which tells me they didn't learn much from their mistakes in implementation. i've made a list i can remember off the top of my head below.

* the combat is pretty weak. i didn't pay much attention to the early access but i was hoping they'd really make the combat more interesting. make no mistake that it's definitely better than what portia had. there's more variety here but it's literally ""smash the x button"" when you get down to it.

* after awhile, farming and mining stuff becomes repetitive which thankfully becomes easier. [strike]unfortunately, because the factory has such a fucked up implementation and literally doesn't work half the time, that convenience can be more irritating than helpful.[/strike] there's also no way to farm certain stuff or to get someone else to fetch it like agate. you have to go out and spend 5-10 minutes picking them 2 at a time. this isn't as big of a deal though, you don't generally need agate that often but for example, flourite you do since certain items that show up on commission require it to increase rarity. the only other way to get that is through ruin tokens which is already expensive and time consuming to obtain....

* some commissions are a trap. it might look easy but they want increased rarity on something like a steel bar which requires flourite to create which is an absolute pain in the ass to get. these commissions are never worth the gold they give (and they don't give much generally). they're there to make you feel miserable. the game should give double gold for such requests or triple gold for rare quality items.

all that said... i've already gotten over 100 hours out of it and i'll probably finish it. i'd wait for a sale but i'd be lying if i said i didn't enjoy it. there isn't really any challenge to it which kinda kills it a little bit. you can fail some stuff but you either have to try to fail it or fail it via a bug. 

bugs i saw while playing:
* literally first five minutes into the game, you'll notice that coco the bird fly's sideways and slow as if running into a wall. literally shows in one of the earliest cutscenes as you start playing.

* mobs and npcs end up your workshop seemingly lost, as if their pathing is telling them to go there for some reason and then they just literally run around doing nothing.

* soft locks are brimming in this game. they seem to be worse when you play the game for extended periods of time which brings me to...

* the game has some issues when played for long periods of time. things load slower or not at all, animations are wonkier, sound may not occur at all having you miss actually interesting voice lines.

* [strike]the factory you get later into the game is a broken mess. the ui doesn't update properly, parts of the ui doesn't work with controller for some reason, and multiple times now i've had the recycler ""production queue"" absolutely busted to where it was unusable. things that should produce more than one of a thing, for example bullets (5 each) or copper screws (2 each), will only produce one which is a clear bug since it shouldn't take fucking 20 steel bars and 50 gunpowder to make literally 10 rifle bullets, but doing the same thing directly on a forge would give you 50.[/strike] this was fixed in latest patch of this writing.

* npcs will fall to the bottom of the map, teleport endlessly, float in the sky or just out of reach, or not be able to interact with them at all until you leave the room or restart the game even.

* npc pathing will often put them smack dab in the middle of a cutscene where they mob pile to the point you can't see anything going on anymore.

* i've softlocked on a lot of scenes that want your character to automatically moved but apparently, i'm alone in this according to the forums.

* i've had the planting grid get stuck in 5x5 when in 4x4 mode, then plant incorrectly. this was with the robot: f machine. edit: there is a 5x5 mode later in the game but the robot isn't supposed to have it. 

* quests not triggering which would then fail after time passes.

* too many events scheduled at once. i had several quests on the same day as the day of memories, all at 1600.  they not only won't reschedule any of them, they also will cause bugs like not letting you join the ghost hunting event.

* probably more i'm not thinking of or too small of a bug to care.",11594,Hard Judge Game Culmination Love Hate Modern Video Games Pros Game Loop Bad Predecessor Modify Characters Game Pretty Decent Distinct Develop Unexpected Neat Larger Life Events Predecessor Conveniences Predecessor Unfortunate Caveats Bugs Cozy Quality Life Game Cons Game Buggy Released Bugs Versions Predecessor Game Tells Learn Mistakes Implementation List Remember Head Combat Pretty Weak Pay Attention Access Hoping Combat Mistake Portia Variety Literally Smash Button Awhile Farming Mining Stuff Repetitive Thankfully Easier Strike Factory Fucked Implementation Literally Time Convenience Irritating Helpful Strike Farm Stuff Fetch Agate Spend 5 Minutes Picking 2 Time Deal Agate Flourite Items Commission Require Increase Rarity Ruin Tokens Expensive Time Consuming Commissions Trap Easy Increased Rarity Steel Bar Requires Flourite Create Absolute Pain Ass Commissions Worth Gold Feel Miserable Game Double Gold Requests Triple Gold Rare Quality Items 100 Hours Finish Wait Sale Lying Enjoy Challenge Kinda Kills Bit Fail Stuff Fail Fail Bug Bugs Playing Literally Minutes Game Notice Coco Bird Fly Sideways Slow Running Wall Literally Earliest Cutscenes Start Playing Mobs Npcs Workshop Seemingly Lost Pathing Telling Reason Literally Soft Locks Brimming Game Worse Play Game Extended Periods Time Brings Game Issues Played Periods Time Load Slower Animations Wonkier Sound Occur Voice Lines Strike Factory Game Broken Mess Ui Update Properly Ui Controller Reason Multiple Times Recycler Production Queue Absolutely Busted Unusable Produce Bullets 5 Copper Screws 2 Produce Bug Fucking 20 Steel Bars 50 Gunpowder Literally Rifle Bullets Forge 50 Strike Fixed Patch Writing Npcs Fall Map Teleport Endlessly Float Sky Reach Interact Leave Restart Game Npc Pathing Smack Dab Middle Cutscene Mob Pile Softlocked Lot Scenes Character Automatically Moved Forums Planting Grid Stuck 5X5 4X4 Mode Plant Incorrectly Robot Machine Edit 5X5 Mode Game Robot Supposed Quests Triggering Fail Time Passes Events Scheduled Quests Day Day Memories 1600 Reschedule Bugs Letting Ghost Hunting Event Thinking Bug Care,POSITIVE,1,0,42,1,0.9767441860465116

2023-11-14,"pretty full synopsis, no spoilers... except for the stupid actor part... which doesn't really spoil anything... it's the equivalent of saying, ""guy walks outside"" oh my gosh... he really did walk outside! spoilersss. i'm confident it wouldn't be the thing that kept me out of heaven by saying no spoilers...

if you liked my time at portia, you'll like this one. the controls are  basically the same with some minor differences that take getting used to. key difference i find amazing is that your storage is linked to your inventory when building, as well as most cases when giving gifts or completing quests. i found one instance where i couldn't give something in my storage and it's probably a bug. if a developer ever reads this, it was when one of the npc's was craving a ""copper plate"" i had to have it physically on me to give in that case... or maybe i'm dumb and haven't realized that all gifts must be in inventory to give and that's just a feature. in other words you don't need to spend hours organizing your storage... just throw it in and call it a day (except for clothes you want to keep... that's worth putting in it's own storage... everything else? who cares?)

relic hunting... is more exciting... maybe some won't like the change but i especially love it. instead of a giant cube room it's multiple floors of some building or something, and there are specific items you can get per floor. it makes it less of a ""find one of 50 relics which each have 2-7 pieces in this one giant room! didn't find them? well then do it all over again!"" now it's more like 5 relics per floor in a designed building that has multiple floors and start from whichever floor you want so long as you've gone deep enough to find the entrance to that floor. huge improvement in my book.

combat... i can't say about all the weapons... i started with the daggers tried, the others once, i love the daggers.... call me thorfin. 

combat is pretty similar to the old game, but just better. from armor breaking/staggering, to varying stats on the same item because of it's quality, which can range from low, to perfect, and then there's rare, which adds some cool features.... whether it's crafting, buying or finding. the items are all much more exciting in this game.

i was disappointed.... that everything feels mostly the same as the original game, but happy it's better. you're basically getting the same game but part two. 

the dialogue is mostly skipable, with the occasional choose your response, in which cases i regret not reading the dialogue... buuuut 95% of the time... totally skipable. unless i'm in a reading mood, i find it average, and occasionally good.

cut scenes.... are extremely lacking... it's like a low quality first time actor playing a major roll in a lead film, and the director says after each scene, ""cut.. that's a wrap... send it to production."" when they should've said, ""cut! that sucks! what are you doing! you're entering a scene where all the monsters are already gone, you've just barely shown up, and then you do a front roll into the room... from the middle of the room... you then aim your pistol, stand up, smile doing a finger spin with the pistol... catch it, blow the smoke off the tip of the pistol, when there is no smoke, because you haven't fired a single shot?... are you stupid? did you take acting lessons from stupid school? did you graduate top of your stupid class with stupid honors? because that was pretty stupid!""

now if they added a character to come in and say those exact words to that silly dude who did all those things... then it would've been hilarious, and we all would've understood... that's the stupid guy... but no, every cut scene is pretty much like that.

i love the game... plenty to make fun of, and critique, but that doesn't stop me from loving it. leave a comment/question if you have any specific inquiries.

dlc worth it?..... you aren't missing anything by not buying any of the dlc items... sure they'll give you a nice head start, but even though i had them i found myself not using any of them because i like starting a game with nothing and then building up to something awesome. if you're the same, save yourself a few bucks, otherwise if you just want some gear for some different looks, then maybe you'll like it.

character creation.... well at least you won't look like you have down syndrome in the game... unless that's what you're going for i'm sure you can pull it off!!! there is a major improvement on the quality of character in the creation tab... but i just want more!!! 

you really don't have a lot of options, and they don't leave you thinking, ""that character i made looks so bad a!!!"" it's more of a, ""well... i guess that's as good as it gets."" i liked how mine turned out, but it took 3 hours of messing around with every possibility, starting and deleting 3 games (the character never looks exactly the same in the game play)...before i finally got to ""my guy looks really kind of okay!""

(example... i put lipstic and changed the coloring on my guy to make him look like he had actual lips... not feminine lips... just dude lips... i get into the game... feminine af! deleted, and then did the same thing except made the lipstick lighter than what looked good... in the gameplay it looked pretty good. i mean.....i'm the equivalent of brad freaking pitt in this character creation screen! i look so good! kindof... joking aside i was happy with the final result. i can't say whether it's the same for making a girl since i didn't try.)

i only played a small amount of the single player version before jumping into multiplayer with my wife.  the big difference i noticed right off was that you have to build & populate the town in multiplayer while most of the towns buildings & populous are already there in single.

while it's a really fun game in multiplayer, it is very much a grind.  it took the 2 of us around 60 hours to get every building built & upgraded so if you find grind tedious, this might not be the game for you.  i found the grind tolerable because it's mixed in with other content such as dungeons, farming, caring for pets & mounts, crafting, exploring, events, house/workshop building and story line.  the best feature of multiplayer is that when you set up a multiplayer game, it's just like renting your own server except it costs you nothing.  you can have the game match you with other players or start a new town and chose to let randoms in or set it to invite only.  when you have players join, unlike many other game, you do not have to be online for them to log in and play.  for the amount of play time and content you'll get out of this game, i think the price tag is a fare price but that will be up to you to determine.  if you don't mine the grind, i recommend this game so watch some gameplay or trailers and see if it's for you.",18838,Multiplayer Review Played Single Player Version Jumping Multiplayer Wife Difference Noticed Build Populate Town Multiplayer Towns Buildings Populous Single Fun Game Multiplayer Grind 2 60 Hours Building Built Upgraded Grind Tedious Game Grind Tolerable Mixed Content Dungeons Farming Caring Pets Mounts Crafting Exploring Events House Workshop Building Story Feature Multiplayer Set Multiplayer Game Renting Server Costs Game Match Players Start Town Chose Randoms Set Invite Players Game Online Log Play Play Time Content Game Price Tag Fare Price Determine Grind Recommend Game Watch Gameplay Trailers,POSITIVE,1,0,50,8,0.8620689655172413

my time at sandrock takes the serie to a whole other level, and i'm here for it. although the gameplay is a bit similar to my time at portia, they were a lot of improvements, but the biggest improvements for me are the story and character design and developpements. i have grown way more attached to the town and it's habitants than with portia, and have had a blast bringing sandrock to it's former glory !

2023-11-07,"there are few games i sit with such great anticipation, dropping everything else to play at launch. as a long time portia fan, i made the decision to wait for the full launch of sandrock so i could  really delve into the experience. it was well worth the wait!! 

mechanics that i loved in portia were only improved by sandrock, i applause the mining and archaeology process! i am glad it's so much easier to manage artifacts and the geodes of ore. i also enjoy the addition of the scrap yard contracts for those older ore types you don't always want to get digging for.

the combat addition of the gun is really funny and clever with the western vibe. although simple, the harder bosses do give a dark soul vibe with the roll dodging.

crafting has only gotten better, and i am glad certain quests don't ask for an egregious number of supplies like portia did some times. very reasonable and smooth to escalate types.

characters! wowie! this has gone leaps and bounds from portia (although i will always love them!) each character is so unique! love the full dialogue for romance options, the personalities of all npcs are a hoot! the writing has me laughing so often, you can feel the love with each cutscene no matter the minor character. i find myself actually wanting to befriend each npc in the city, they all have such great personality!

the story has been just as fun as portia, i love the world building of this series. my only complaint is wanting more!! need a prequel surrounding peach or something. the enemies, the subtle build of tension with hints through the newspapers and letters are a great touch. i find myself excited to open the mail!

my only cons so far are:
bugs - very minor though. this game is so much cleaner than portia at launch, a bit of hair bugs or clothing doesn't hurt nobody.
npc pathing - ai is always hard to manage, but lord trying to find some of these people before friend status is a nightmare! 
unfortunate timings - i have had a few funny situations regarding cutscenes, sandstorms and time management. maybe i'm just very efficient, but sometimes the mix and match of time sensitive missions can be a nightmare. shout out to the calendar feature!

all in all, this game is an amazing addition to my much beloved portia. the team knocked it out of the park and it's great to see what a budget can do. i am genuinely excited for any and all extra content they may throw our way, and i hope they celebrate such an awesome launch!",15801,Games Sit Anticipation Dropping Play Launch Time Portia Fan Decision Wait Launch Sandrock Delve Experience Worth Wait Mechanics Loved Portia Improved Sandrock Applause Mining Archaeology Process Glad Easier Manage Artifacts Geodes Ore Enjoy Addition Scrap Yard Contracts Ore Types Digging Combat Addition Gun Funny Clever Western Vibe Simple Harder Bosses Dark Soul Vibe Roll Dodging Crafting Glad Quests Egregious Supplies Portia Times Reasonable Smooth Escalate Types Characters Wowie Leaps Bounds Portia Love Character Unique Love Dialogue Romance Options Personalities Npcs Hoot Writing Laughing Feel Love Cutscene Matter Minor Character Befriend Npc City Personality Story Fun Portia Love Building Series Complaint Prequel Surrounding Peach Enemies Subtle Build Tension Hints Newspapers Letters Touch Excited Mail Cons Bugs Minor Game Cleaner Portia Launch Bit Hair Bugs Clothing Hurt Npc Pathing Hard Manage Lord People Friend Status Nightmare Unfortunate Timings Funny Situations Cutscenes Sandstorms Time Management Efficient Mix Match Time Sensitive Missions Nightmare Shout Calendar Feature Game Amazing Addition Beloved Portia Team Knocked Park Budget Genuinely Excited Extra Content Throw Hope Celebrate Awesome Launch,POSITIVE,1,0,31,10,0.7560975609756098

a really cool standout thing is that you can design your own house, rather than ""make 20% bigger upgrade."" it took me a minute to figure out how to do it, but once i understood how it worked, it reminded me a lot of building houses in the sims. 

the only thing they didn't upgrade was the voice acting, i'm afraid. just like in mtap, some of it is decent, but most of it is a bit tedious. a lot of the actors talk so slowly, it doesn't sound like natural speech and i find myself reading ahead and skipping, which is something i never do. as a voice actor myself, i like to give other voice actors their due, but sometimes in this game, i just can't do it.",9123,Time Sandrock Time Portia Upgraded Annoying Water Tank Stocked Addition Fuel Machines Water Game Set Actual Desert Mad Worry Water Bunch Lends Air Realism Forgive Cool Standout Design House 20 Bigger Upgrade Minute Figure Understood Reminded Lot Building Houses Sims Upgrade Voice Acting Afraid Mtap Decent Bit Tedious Lot Actors Talk Slowly Sound Natural Speech Reading Skipping Voice Actor Voice Actors Game,POSITIVE,1,0,147,16,0.901840490797546

2023-11-23,"i don't leave reviews often so let me explain why i am this time first then i'll talk about sandrock.  back in 2014 i bought pathea's (first?  think so?) game called planet explorers.  i loved it at first but it had such a long development then in 2016 they ""full released"" the game, all while i still encountered game breaking bugs in the first 10min of gameplay that i had when i first started the game in '14.  coming off of also getting burned on several other steam greenlight games (yall remember that s**t?!), i swore that i would never, ever, buy another pathea game again..... then in 2018 i saw this cute game pop up in my feed called my time at portia, i was immediately in love with the art style and premise of the game and bought immediately, somehow missing the pathea logos and name the entire time.  by the time i realized that they were made by the same devs i had like some 100+hrs in portia and exhausted all the content even available at the time.  i did become a bit doomer and just awaited it to just disappear into history as another abandoned game.... well i have 300+ hours in portia now and it ranks as one of my favorite games of all time.  so firstly, i want to thank pathea games for doing a complete flip in my book and coming out with absolute bangers that have lost me many hours in workshop (my real one not the one in game, that workshop gets overused!)

now, lets talk about sandrock specifically (no story spoilers dont worry).  i had no idea it was even coming until it was too late to even back it on kickstarted and i hated myself for it!  i mean look at sandrock!  it has everything i love portia and then just completely redid it or made it even better.  the art style is such a nice thing to look at, the animations feel so much more complete and the gameplay feels nice and balanced and gives you full freedom to play how you will with very little in the way of forcing progress except when you really want to.  don't wanna go ultra super heavy into making your workshop mega and just wanna socialize?  you got it!  or you can do what i do and take #1 builder before the first month is even over (suck it yan!). the characters are all so lovable or just absolutely memorable to me, pen is such a over the top dude, yan while being your main 'rival' doesn't like actively take commissions from you like higgins did (no more sprinting off to the guild to grab the good commissions before he does), and miguel as much as i don't like him like him i at least have an understanding of him and even at times sympathize with his views.  i was put off at first by how you get more resources from recyclers rather than just straight gather (which there is still plenty of!) but in time i grew to really enjoy that i could have all them crunching for copper while i go get iron.  everything about it feels so well thought and improved from portia while not feeling like they just ctrl+c ctrl+v.  while it does get tedious at first managing both water and fuel for machines it became second nature when i run over to machine to start new production to just auto fill with dregs and i rarely had an issue anymore of machine out of water/fuel(by the way never ever use your wood for fuel just go slap some powerstones or get some dregs, thank me later).  the greatest improvement imo is combat which feels leagues ahead of the combat i remember from portia and i actually like dungeon diving now (before it was more ugh ok i guess ill go...).  socializing also feels alot easier in this game, admittedly i tend to always put socializing on the back burner but in my now post release game everyone loves me.  the one thing i really complained about was it felt like i had not enough time to do everything i wanted because i had to run here or there to get things done but that got solved when i found the time slider, won't really help you crunch resources faster since those are timed to in game time, but it's easier to run home and start something to turn in a com without running out of time due to me spending time walking, i found that a .67 time setting to be a nice sweet spot for getting places without dragging a day too long.  

and on the story itself, again, no spoilers, but it's good, really good imo.  it kept me hooked and interested the whole way, and also laughing because this game doesn't try to make everything so serious even in the more serious parts of the game (there's always a punch line xd). i got so excited in the last major update before release that i couldn't help myself but again play all through the twist and turns of what i think is the climax of the game (haven't full played on release yet so idk if theres even more after that!) and even after completing it i didn't feel like i was done or satisfied, there was still more work to do, still more commissions to get and more to build and to get sandrock back to its former glory (and even better!).  before release, i had just shy of 300hrs in sandrock and in the past 2 weeks, even with my bloated work schedule these days ive blown 80hrs in my new playthough and i can definately see myself blowing another 300 on this game before i get 'tired' of it. 

the tldr of it is, yes, buy this game.  you'll love it, play how you want to play, don't get the biggest baddest workshop if you dont want to, dont socialize alot if you dont want to.  or do!  sit back, relax, take a load off your mind and just create and have fun or go full try hard and show that yan dude whose the real newbie.  and pathea, from the just in my opinion let down of planet explorers, you have my eternal gratitude for portia and sandrock and you have won me fully back and just eager for the day the next my time at x game comes out (highwind!? altara? i mean coooommmmee ooooonnnn!!!)

2023-11-22,"my time at sandrock is a more challenging game than its predecessor my time at portia.  i find that enjoyable as barely halfway through portia it was easy street and became a bit repetitive/boring.  sandrock isn't so easy to just farm fish and watch your money problems disappear.  you have to pay attention and manage your water use or everything shuts down (dew collectors will be your best friend so make sure to harvest all the yakmels surrounding your workshop daily if you have time).  i like the challenge of farming, much more difficult in this game with the environment.  it's a very fun game.  it has some combat but just the basic left click to attack spam so not terribly complex (which is good for me as its not my strength).  you can push to progress the plot quickly or let it sit and just build things and collect resources which i enjoy.  i do dislike those darn scorpions on multi-player now as they are jump scares that hide under the sand and then attack.  finally figured out you hear a bit of a digging sound just before it so that heart attack is settled down now.  i like how all the npc's have personalities, it's very enjoyable to watch the character progression as trudy finds her backbone, elsie finds her passion and arvio well honestly he's annoying, he gets better but man is he a brat for most of the game.  it's nice that i can now save beyond sleeping so i don't lose a day if i need to leave the game.  oh recommendation - don't give gems as presents.  you will need them quicker than you think to refine your equipment/machines.  i'd prioritize schmoozing up owen and sadly arvio as a priority for their shop discounts, always buy salt daily unless the market rate is super high.  you need it for dried fish and making leather (which you need for those beloved dew collectors).  track what you give them so you don't devalue your gifts, basically alternate.  once i hit the point where i could make them i found frying pans and copper pots best value for owen and book shelves / storage boxes for arvio.  pretty much everyone loves rhino horne cactus but by the time you have access to them you can usually give something better or have already hit your desired best friend status.  oh, another tip that took me way to long to figure out.  so you want to refine your equipment for those sweet production benefits right?  but!  the mid-tier and end game equipment take rarer gems to upgrade which can be challenging.  but what you can do is build the low tier recycler/furnace or whatever and refine it to the desired rare status with the best benefit (aim for 12% to production or time reduction, usually by the time you get to refining you don't desperately need the fuel or water reduction).  so refine the low tier machine and then upgrade it to the mid-tier or end game level machine.   early game aim for at least four recyclers, four furnaces, two grinders & two processors with at least one of every other machine as they become available.  add more machines whenever you want/can after that but man - watch out for that water consumption!  it's just super sad to see a long line of rare machines sitting collecting dust because the water cost has gone insane and even then you can only buy so many per day.  enjoy the game!",9290,Time Sandrock Challenging Game Predecessor Time Portia Enjoyable Barely Halfway Portia Easy Street Bit Repetitive Boring Sandrock Easy Farm Fish Watch Money Disappear Pay Attention Manage Water Shuts Dew Collectors Friend Harvest Yakmels Surrounding Workshop Daily Time Challenge Farming Difficult Game Environment Fun Game Combat Basic Left Attack Spam Terribly Complex Strength Push Progress Plot Sit Build Collect Resources Enjoy Dislike Darn Scorpions Multi Player Jump Scares Hide Sand Attack Finally Figured Hear Bit Digging Sound Heart Attack Settled Npc Personalities Enjoyable Watch Character Progression Trudy Backbone Elsie Passion Arvio Honestly Annoying Brat Game Nice Save Sleeping Lose Day Leave Game Recommendation Gems Quicker Refine Equipment Machines Prioritize Schmoozing Owen Sadly Arvio Priority Shop Discounts Salt Daily Market Rate Super Dried Fish Leather Beloved Dew Collectors Track Devalue Gifts Basically Alternate Hit Frying Pans Copper Pots Owen Book Shelves Storage Boxes Arvio Pretty Loves Rhino Horne Cactus Time Access Hit Desired Friend Status Figure Refine Equipment Sweet Production Benefits Mid Tier Game Equipment Rarer Gems Upgrade Challenging Build Tier Recycler Furnace Refine Desired Rare Status Benefit Aim 12 Production Time Reduction Time Refining Desperately Fuel Water Reduction Refine Tier Machine Upgrade Mid Tier Game Level Machine Game Aim Recyclers Furnaces Grinders Processors Machine Add Machines Watch Water Consumption Super Sad Rare Machines Sitting Collecting Dust Water Cost Insane Day Enjoy Game,POSITIVE,1,0,247,20,0.9250936329588015

2023-11-20,"if you liked my time at portia, or tried to like my time at portia but just couldn't get into the game due to pacing, mining, and inventory management killing your chill vibe, then you owe it to yourself to spend time in sandrock instead.

this games takes an already wonderful game concept and builds it into something so much better. the amount of quality of life improvements that have been made between sandrock and portia is noticeable and praise worthy. these improvements will have you coming back to the game hour after hour and still enjoying your time. 

the great:
honestly there are to many to list. i usually try to list and rate major factors of a game  so others don't have to work on my opinion alone, but we will be here all day if i list them. some of the top things for me are character customization both in creation and outfits, variety of romance options (and honestly the weirdly charming townsfolk in general), and the ease of crafting, turning in commissions, and mining are the first to pop into my head. but others such as the game pacing, accessibility features like being able to slow down the game speed, and fluidity of combat are very close to the top as well. 

the bad:
honestly not much. there are some small video glitches, and the housing and yard customization can be troublesome (i really wish there was a confirmation button for the retrieve option when you are trying to move stuff around your yard, cause i just wanted to move it not take it all back into my inventory). but nothing else stands out as really needing attention. some quests have been redone and if you are reading guides to make sure your choices work for you, then you may be out of luck as the choices (and in some instances the quest as a whole) are different, but that's very very tiny.",10102,Time Portia Time Portia Game Pacing Mining Inventory Management Killing Chill Vibe Owe Spend Time Sandrock Games Takes Wonderful Game Concept Builds Quality Life Improvements Sandrock Portia Noticeable Praise Worthy Improvements Coming Game Hour Hour Enjoying Time Honestly List List Rate Major Factors Game Opinion Day List Character Customization Creation Outfits Variety Romance Options Honestly Weirdly Charming Townsfolk Ease Crafting Commissions Mining Pop Head Game Pacing Accessibility Features Slow Game Speed Fluidity Combat Close Bad Honestly Video Glitches Housing Yard Customization Troublesome Confirmation Button Retrieve Option Stuff Yard Inventory Stands Attention Quests Redone Reading Guides Choices Luck Choices Instances Quest Tiny,POSITIVE,1,0,27,0,1.0

but i have one big thing to say that may affect if you should buy this game or not.

if you want to play multiplayer, you are stuck to a singular character per server. you cannot have multiple characters on a server and thus if you p[ay with a friend, but want to play fresh with another friend- you either delete your current character and make a new one, or change to a different server and make one there.

2023-11-19,"my time at sandrock is an amazing game which isn't surprising considering how great my time at portia was(i bought it on three different platforms i think). they took everything from the previous game and improved on it. combat is fun and fluid though the guns are definitely over powered. the story is immersive with a couple of plot twists i didn't see coming and one i did. the npcs all feel well developed personality wise. there were a few unlikable npcs but its clear they were designed that way so thats another point in the developers favor. i think the biggest problem with my time at sandrock is that it makes me want another three games. one in each of the other cities so i can see the overarching story progress even further. 

bottom line is if your a fan of games like: harvest moon, story of seasons, or my personal favorite rune factory then you will have a blast with this game.  not to mention theres still content being added which i expect will draw me in for another twenty hours or so. 9.3/10",13708,Time Sandrock Amazing Game Surprising Time Portia Bought Platforms Previous Game Improved Combat Fun Fluid Guns Powered Story Immersive Couple Plot Twists Coming Npcs Feel Developed Personality Wise Unlikable Npcs Designed Developers Favor Biggest Time Sandrock Games Cities Overarching Story Progress Fan Games Harvest Moon Story Seasons Personal Favorite Rune Factory Blast Game Mention Content Expect Draw Hours 9 3,POSITIVE,1,0,27,3,0.9

2023-11-18,"this game is amazing, beautiful and full of content.
something from me:
 if you haven't played my time at portia, no worries because game gives a lot of tutorials for old and new/redesigned mechanics. in my opinion it's worth to buy even though it's pretty expensive. i think it's even more understandable game than portia, but there is still one basic problem. it's about portia and sandrock, that both games can get bored with some time, and it's just important to make breaks for other games too, since when you decide to stop playing it, it's hard to come back (because of amount of stuff and mechanics you might forgot in that time). 

advantages + :
- game is very addictive
- story is very interesting
- graphic design and landscapes are not that perfect, but it's a lot better in comparision with my time at portia
- in general designs have changed, like customization, better quality textures
- omg you can literally buy horse and stable. and it's not about horses only, there are other animals you can ride too like camel
- concept with sandstorms and sandwall in your workshop is amazing
- game is just more clear than my time at portia when it comes to produice something in comparision to portia
- event quests in game are very cool
- i'm willing to play that with my best buddy in coop because game finally have that option! :))
disadvantages:
- i found some bugs, for instance character i was talking with suddenly jumped into sky and started to fall down, but game is still playable (at least for me)
and honetly i don't see any other disadvantages, i just fell in love with this game :>
so if you wonder if you should play it, ofc you shoould.

 small tip for beginenrs: don't take unknown commision from board because you might realize in the end that you can't produce that thing and need special machine, but to get that machine you have to wait from 2 to even 6 or 7 days in research station, and your commision might have like 2-3 days left to finish it (naaah totally not my experience)

2023-11-16,"i bounced off my time at portia quite hard so i was really surprised how much i really enjoyed my time at sandrock. 

is the game still far too grindy? yes. i really wish they could tone down how much busywork is in these games and the reliance of in-game timers to finish crafting items and juggling between multiple devices. but this is really my only strong criticism other than fairly weak combat.

but this life sim does one thing better than any other released this year or in recent memory - it creates a real sense of community and growth. my biggest bugbear about games like animal crossing is that you, the player, are the only person doing anything to help the world around you while everyone just sits pretty and asks you to do the work. sandrock has you working with other characters to produce a better world and that's fantastic. is this a facade most of the time where you're doing exactly the same amount of work as in any other game? probably - but it helps to see the other builders put in work and to see donation boxes already partially full from other members of the community even if it is a trick. 

the characters are mostly pretty memorable and interesting - i usually struggle in other games of this type with remembering who is who, especially with romance-able characters who all seem bland and slapdash - and it does a good job of creating pricks in the community who you really wish you didn't have to deal with but have to because that's how a community is sometimes. 

the final 'act' of the game is quite special and while it had some of the grindiest components, i was glad i stuck through it because it was good to see how much of a difference i had made from when the game started and where i ended up in a way these games often don't really do.

2023-11-14,"if you love farming/building simulation games, you will most likely love this one. i have not even finished the game yet, but i wanted to post an honest and informative review while the game is at the height of attention. this is by far the #1 game in the genre for me. i normally do short and sweet reviews, but for a game like this i want to go over some of the important aspects of it that may make or break the players experience. so let me explain the good, the bad, and the ugly.

[b]the good[/b]:
-outstanding amount of content. you can see by my playtime that i have put in a significant amount of time. i have not even finished the main story yet, and i am not actually sure how close i am to the end. there is plenty of upgrades, levels, npc content, and building/farming to be done here

-you can have a farm with plants, chickens, buffalo, bunnies, and mounts

-there are about 20 or so romance-able npc's, all with their own character growth and story arcs along side the main story. some of them are very well done and interesting while others are not quite as fleshed out, but still enjoyable

-combat in the game is quick-paced hack-n-slash shoot-em-up style. there are ""dungeons"" to breeze through where you can get treasure, materials, and glory

-festivals are a lot of fun. you unlock more festivals as the game progresses and there are fun little mini games and unique events for each one of them.

-character creation is a bit similar to my time at portia and there are a lot of lore-friendly outfits and accessories you can use to personalize your builder. the hairstyles and coloring can be customized quite a bit to give you a unique look as well

-you can go on dates and hangout with the friends you meet in town, you can play mini games in an arcade and even mahjong at a later portion of the game.

-progression is slow but it feels great. every new house and machine upgrade you get feels like an achievement. you can upgrade your mounts, raise animals, have a huge farm, and it all feels earned. once you get more levels for your workshop and character and progress the main story you can automate collection of resources to help your progression quite a bit.

-the developers are awesome and are constantly replying to concerns and bug reports in the forums, as well as trying to improve the game.

[b]the bad[/b]:
-progression is slow. i know i stated this above, but people with not a lot of time on their hands may feel that they are not getting anywhere. a lot of this probably has a lot to do with how fast you decide to progress time. you can choose anywhere from 0.6x-3.0 time progression speed, and i believe that can have an impact on the pace of the game and how quickly it goes by. i like to take things slow and experience everything the game has to offer, so i have it set at 0.6.

-stamina and time can be hard to manage at first. you may feel a struggle early game trying to get the resources you need and finishing missions on time. this caveat goes away after getting some levels and experience under your belt. a lot of people feel a struggle at the beginning. taking the game slow is a good idea at the beginning until you get used to it.

-certain resources are very hard to get such as electronics, certain plants, trees, or animal resources. some of this stuff you need for progression but it is hard or impossible to automate in any way at the beginning. when you do commissions/missions for townsfolk, if you are not careful then you won't be able to complete them on time. this is why it is good to take it slow at the beginning and learn the ins-and-outs. this adds to early game struggle and gives a sense of not getting anywhere.

-some of the romance-able npc's don't really have much character development or story missions, decreasing their interesting aspect.

-the house building/decorating leaves much to be desired. it is difficult to place objects or know what objects to place in certain circumstances. the building ui is clunky and not user friendly. it can be struggle to get a look that you like. there are mismatched patterns or just plain ugly ones when making roofs or rooms. they honestly should have hired a color expert or interior decorator because some combinations of design can be atrocious. this part of the game is passable and you can get something that you are satisfied with, but it could take some workaround.

-workshop upgrades are incredibly expensive, to the point where you have to grind money for a long time to get room for all of the workshop add-ons, machines, and other goodies. it took me a good month of in game time to get an upgrade that would give me enough building space to extend my house because of how much money it was to get it. this part of the game feels a bit unbalanced, especially with how much money you will be spending elsewhere.

[b]the ugly[/b]
-this game is bethesda level buggy as of right now. i am not even remotely exaggerating. there are issues with npc's disappearing out of nowhere, floating mounts that you can't ride because they are stuck in the air, a visual bug that messes with some resource contracts, unclear missions markers or explanations etc.

-some missions have a timer on them. so you need to complete it in a certain number of days. there are several missions that you will fail for no reason at all with no in-game timer attached to them. these missions show no sign and give no hint of a fail-trigger, but if you don't do them then you will fail them at some point for what seems like no reason. i have had this happen a few times. this is usually with side missions. 

-you need to save a lot. there are some potentially game breaking bugs and missions you can screw up through no fault of your own, as stated above. it is a good idea to have several hard saves just in case something undesirable happens that messes up your progress with missions, npc's, or other aspects.

-the game does not run well sometimes. i get around ~60 fps pretty consistently, but certain areas, scenes, or events can cause huge framerate drops to as low as 15 fps, and i have had the game crash on me once. some people report even worse performance, but for me it is tolerable. i have a pretty decent gaming computer. i can run cyberpunk on max with a constant 60-70 fps, and this game performs slightly worse in certain cases. i will say that it seems they have ironed out some of this in the last week or so since my performance seems to have improved over the last couple days. in particular, when the train comes into town is one of the points where i get an fps drop to 15, but earlier today it did not drop when the train came in.

the game is by no means perfect, but it is my favorite game in the genre. if you liked portia or games like stardew valley, coral island, or any other popular sim games like this, then you will probably love this one. the developers are constantly looking at feedback and improving the game, so i am almost positive all of the negatives i pointed out will be fixed at some point in the future. they have already been actively releasing post-launch updates and they even intend to add more content eventually from what i have read. the developers and this game have my full confidence and support!

2023-11-09,"i had not played previous games by this developer, so for me there was a fairly hefty learning curve.  still, the story line, visuals, interaction, and game play are all interesting and very enjoyable.  it quickly became the game i want to play more than others.  
it isn't without bugs, but the developer is responsive and releasing patches frequently.  none of the glitches i've experienced have impacted my ability to play the game.  at one point the event audio got out-of-sync and i was hearing dialog from both previous and future events.  it was annoying, but not a game-stopper and closing/reopening the game resolved it.  another issue where display of elevators was lagging saw a fix released the very next day (kudos!) 
for me, the user interface seems inconsistent and somewhat clunky.  here are a few examples:  i'm not a fan of holding 'tab' to switch to garden mode, scrolling to select an action, then pressing 'e' to select the seed, etc.  at worst, it can be frustrating determining the mouse/keystrokes needed to perform an action.  at best, it is never something i can do via muscle-memory without thinking.  device production statistics is also not well laid out. even after playing a considerable time i still have to study each machine's statistics to find the bit of information i'm looking for.   one positive, there is an icon in each device that allows focusing it to requirements of pending tasks--love that.  there is also a need for improvement to the main map to add more detail and descriptions.  an item might say it can be found in the quarry, but the quarry is not labelled on the map.  
the above items are minor to me and overall i enjoy this game and highly recommend it.

2023-11-09,"      as someone who has played their fair share of life simulation games, with the variety of animal crossing, stardew valley, and palia to be some of the main ones, this game comes very close to beating them all. i was thrilled to find out that this game was going to have multiplayer in it, seeing as my time at portia does not have multiplayer, which heavily influenced my choice to buy it or not.

      this game can be buggy at times and while i only have a 980 gpu, i can run this game at medium settings and it still looks pretty decent. i did not play the early access, only full release, and i can say that there seems to be quite a bit of content to this game. this game is very multifaceted with social/town, farming, combat, mining, building, animal, and pet aspects, with that just being what i have discovered with 19 hours of playing. i play with 2 other people and the game runs fairly well. i have only encountered a few lag/server sync issues between other players, a few ui glitch errors, and 1 wonky combat fight with an elite. but beyond those few things i haven't seen much to stop me from wanting to play this game as much as possible. 


[h3] pros [/h3]
- lots of content (19 hours in and it feels like i have so much more to do)
- decent price (i was gifted the game but seeing the price for how fun this game is seems fair)
- fun with friends
- multiplayer actual works
- leveling up feels important and good
- missions feel good and not like leg work (you can visually see the work you put into the town)
- tons of townspeople
- combat feels good and fun
- character customization (you can super customize your character with sliders)
- gear (weapons and clothes have stats that can help you with gathering and fighting)
- weather (the weather events in this game are really great. so far i have seen rain, sandstorm, and summer 
   heat. i am waiting to see snow in this game as of yet.)
- server stays up (no matter who owns the town, i am able to play on my friends server even after the 
   person who made it has left. this is a big game changer for me seeing as you don't have to stop playing on 
   one server because the host has left or crashed.)

[h3] cons [/h3]

- desync/stutter issues (i have only had this happen 2-3 times playing so far and it is fixed by a simple return 
  to lobby and rejoin.)
- ui machine icons disappear (i have only seen this once and it was fixed by rejoining the lobby)
- forced personal chests (i mention this because it was a pain to have only so much room in the one 
   community chest you get at the start of the game. you can upgrade it, but i would like to have the option 
   to share my personal chest contents if i choose to. and not have to run back to home every time someone 
   needed something.
- combat (could use a little work on hit registration and how your character can go through the enemies 
   while swinging your weapon)
- accidental playable character requests (in the game there is an option to talk to real people and play a 
   mini-game called critters. it feels a bit annoying at times when you are trying to interact with machines or

2023-11-03,"my time at sandrock is a life simulator game about being an combat engineer-farmer in a post-apocalyptic arid desert setting where water is a scarcity. if you've played the previous game in the series, my time at sandrock is superior in every single way except perhaps the price tag and in the rare category of ""games with quality and originality from a chinese developer"".

unlike the previous game in the series, the game has little focus on time limits and is generally a laid-back experience focused a little more on storytelling than on repetitive routine actions. you build devices, conduct repairs, decorate your home, ingratiate yourself to other townsfolk - it's tempting to compare it to stardew valley, however i find this somewhat inaccurate because stardew valley has little in the way of interesting writing, characterisation, nor a plotline to keep me engaged in it as it relies heavily on a modding community for such content.

this writing and characterisation successfully caters to both children and adults - characters aren't particularly complex in personality, however, the dialogue has an abundance of dry wit, sarcasm and humour to lampoon the moral lessons it's trying to impart; this cushions the irritation that adults may experience when being preached to about what they would consider as obvious lessons in responsibility such as ""don't waste water"", ""don't monopolise resources"", ""don't behave like a psychopath"".

nowhere is this more apparent than in quests where saturday-morning-cartoon npcs blithely remark on and lampshade their anti-social behaviour before you deal with them in a series of increasingly surreal methods. this makes the game worth playing for the comedic nonsensical and satirical value alone. 

the cast of characters to interact with is amazingly diverse, and not in an annoyingly forced and hackneyed way, but in personality too. many of them have humourous character flaws, such as the sheriff's remarkably feckless and cavalier attitude toward due process; or his devoted understudy, who rather uniquely portrays autism in an endearing and positive light. i did not once feel that the game was overtly trying to advance a political nor social agenda on the player, which is often the case with other offerings in this genre.

it was a very wise decision to adopt this writing style as the story may have come off heavy-handed and sententious/preachy otherwise. this character building is absolutely unmatched by any other life simulator game i have ever played. the game even gives you the freedom to be as antisocial, spiteful and negative as you want, although this will obviously alienate yourself from the town community.

if you're looking to wind down from an exhausting day, i can think of few better games to play. if you're looking for a challenging and stressful skill-based game however, you may want to look elsewhere. my biggest regret is that i've finished most of it and that i'm going to have to wait a few more years for a sequel in order to see where the world's storyline is going next.",11835,Time Sandrock Life Simulator Game Combat Engineer Farmer Post Apocalyptic Arid Desert Setting Water Scarcity Played Previous Game Series Time Sandrock Superior Single Price Tag Rare Category Games Quality Originality Chinese Developer Previous Game Series Game Focus Time Limits Laid Experience Focused Storytelling Repetitive Routine Actions Build Devices Conduct Repairs Decorate Ingratiate Townsfolk Tempting Compare Stardew Valley Inaccurate Stardew Valley Writing Characterisation Plotline Engaged Relies Heavily Modding Community Content Writing Characterisation Caters Children Adults Characters Complex Personality Dialogue Abundance Dry Wit Sarcasm Humour Lampoon Moral Lessons Impart Cushions Irritation Adults Experience Preached Obvious Lessons Responsibility Waste Water Monopolise Resources Behave Psychopath Apparent Quests Saturday Morning Cartoon Npcs Blithely Remark Lampshade Anti Social Behaviour Deal Series Increasingly Surreal Methods Game Worth Playing Comedic Nonsensical Satirical Cast Characters Interact Amazingly Diverse Annoyingly Forced Hackneyed Personality Humourous Character Flaws Sheriff Remarkably Feckless Cavalier Attitude Process Devoted Understudy Uniquely Portrays Autism Endearing Positive Light Feel Game Overtly Advance Political Social Agenda Player Offerings Genre Wise Decision Adopt Writing Style Story Heavy Handed Sententious Preachy Character Building Absolutely Unmatched Life Simulator Game Played Game Freedom Antisocial Spiteful Negative Alienate Town Community Wind Exhausting Day Games Play Challenging Stressful Skill Based Game Biggest Regret Finished Wait Sequel Storyline,POSITIVE,1,0,74,8,0.9024390243902439

voice acting - ranges from good to poor. this is probably the weakest aspect of the game for me along with some of the writing.
audio - generally good music and sfx (edit - they improved a lot of the sounds in 1.0 so my complain in this area is gone).

personal recommendation: set the day game speed to .6 to avoid the days going by too fast.

review: my time in sandrock falls into the crafting, combat, life sim genre which has plenty of options to choose from. so why pick up sandrock over any of the dozens of other games that offer similar gameplay? two main reasons, the quest in the game (side/main) and the story of game. 

by interacting with a large portion of the town over and over again you not only build relationships, get to know everyone’s backstories, goals, and motivations but with many of the side quests that you do, impact the world. 

you do a side quest to paint the inside of somebody’s house or build thing x inside the town square, then it will forever change and be there the rest of the game. so, the game really has weight behind it as you complete the main and side quest watching sandrock change into what you, the player, have done and it’s amazing to see. also, by doing all these side quests and your daily job as a builder you really get to know everybody and making the story (please note not all the writing is great) invested excited to see what happens next like you’re a part of sandrock. so…welcome.",11769,Disclaimer Played Time Portia Hours Note Handful Hours Stamina Starved Time Personal Recommendation Set Day Game Speed 6 Avoid Days Fast Review Time Sandrock Falls Crafting Combat Life Sim Genre Plenty Options Choose Pick Sandrock Dozens Games Offer Gameplay Main Reasons Quest Game Main Story Game Interacting Portion Town Build Relationships Backstories Goals Motivations Quests Impact Quest Paint House Build Town Square Change Rest Game Game Weight Complete Main Quest Watching Sandrock Change Player Amazing Quests Daily Job Builder Story Note Writing Invested Excited Sandrock,POSITIVE,1,0,82,9,0.9010989010989011

this game is adorable, has a unique cartoonish style to it and has so much content that it is almost rediculous!

it has a surprising amount of story to it and really good english voice acting and writing, even better than a lot of aaa games! the characters have proper individual personalities and emotions that are portrayed with great voice acting.

i played the game all the way through to the ending credits at a little over 115hours! and i had barely even customized my house or started any sort of serious money farming or such.

this really is one of those games that almost ""has it all""... it can be described as a post-apocalyptic, choices matter rpg, shooter, mining exploration, bossfight, male or female or both dating sim, farming, story driven, crafting, dancing, racing, animal befriending, friendship simulator, hack & slash, adventure, slice-of-life game.

and if you are a fan of the first game ""my time at portia"" this takes a lot of the great mechanics and things from that game and manages to make them even better.

i don't want to spoil anything, but this is one of those games that right when i start thinking i am nearing the end of the story, something crazy happens and next thing i know another 20+ hours of content is in front of me.

2023-11-22,"i almost missed this awesome title cause my time in portia was soo... bad, but it looks like the devs learned from that experience. this game was a refreshing surprise. it felt like stardew valley on fortnite graphics. the character in the game felt fun and alive. the game is so addictive i've missed a few meals and some sleep in the single player campaign. this game is filled with alot of pop culture references and fun tropes. while i haven't finished the single player story yet, i have more than a 160 hrs in-game. i will of course update this review on completion of the game.

there are some stutters and minor bugs in the single player mode to be addressed buy nothing game breaking. 

while the multiplayer runs better (yea shocking, i know right), i found the multiple player boring and unengaging as it feels like a bunch of chores disconnected from anything resembling a story.

its hard to believe that its technically a game made by small developers, borderline indie. there's so much love in it, though, that it really stands out. and you can tell the devs love their game too, and that's amazing.

i hope they continue to do this ""little bit of everything"" but making more ambitious ones.

i hope the next feature is building up whatever engine is this to improve the animations so characters feel more alive than as stiff they (e.g in the carriage).

2023-11-26,"great game. must buy if you liked portia. minor spoilers below.
list of bugs i encountered throughout playing:
- characters get stuck into each other trying to exit a building
- you can climb along the cliff when you get to the ""mama tree"" and fall down the other side of the cliff of the desert and get stuck
- ""into the abyss"" mission you get a slow debuff that says 0sec duration but remains throughout the mission so i just spam roll everywhere.
- in the next dungeon after i had a slow and poison debuff of 0 sec that was permanent until i died and reloaded.
- once or twice loading screen didnt work when entering the house so i lost 20-30mins of progress (autosaves saved the day)
- everyone gets handed a medal but mc does a t-pose when receiving the medal
- mc becomes semi/fully transparent/invisible when mounting a horse and then briefly when dismounting.
- mounts and npcs constantly teleport to get to where they need to go so u have to ""catch them"" via dialogue before they fade with the wind.
- married amirah and her bd party is during one of the festivals so she didnt even attend her own party
- built the sand buggy on the assembly station and it was literally invisible
- was outside the house and my pet was stuck in the walls of my house
- bumble ants like to walk into the walls of my property (bad pathing)
- there are two enemies that no longer spawn due to game progression but civil commissions are still posted asking you to wipe them out.
- there were a couple instances where commissions are posted asking you to create an item using resources that are farmed in an area you dont have access to yet.

list of stuff i didnt like:
- too many relic pieces and i didnt want to spend the time looking/sorting through each storage box to find the duplicates so i would make multiple storage boxes which would have the same duplicate in multiple boxes
- max backpack space is a lot, but was still maxing it out more often than i wanted to as there are items (like gifts) i always kept on hand
- to 100% steam achievements in a reasonable time you need to talk and gift everyone from day 1 as social exp is a big grind otherwise
- weapon perks are unbalanced; why pick a 10% slow/burn/poison chance on hit when u can just go raw crit build with crit dmg, crit chance and lifedrain
- cant keep track of items donated to the museum unless you manually track it on spreadsheet (see guide in forums)
- when npc's steal your kill, you dont have that enemy registered to the bestiary, so if that enemy is a boss enemy that only spawns once, glhf. you also get no exp
- npc's run as fast as a slow horse, but you're stuck with the same runspeed throughout the game (exception is temporary buff in dungeon).
- read in forums automation doesnt give you workshop exp
- animals seemed like an afterthought since those buildings are maxed at lv 1, otherwise is a decent choice for extra side income
- thrown items were meh, and you cant use them to mine ores
- hard to build relationship pts with kids or animals since they dont post commissions so with animals you can only talk and gift once a day, (with kids you can also play critters)
- non essential npc's have nothing better to say other than ""...""
- va for musa is also a soldier.

things i did like:
- items from storage can be used to turn in items for quests
- good variety of characters/memorable personalities, but then there's people like jensen who has no backstory
- get to see how your projects build sandrock up, enjoyed the story and how it related to the last game
- ranged weapons are a pretty cheesy way of beating combat content 
- melee combat was good for a game not focused on combat
- enough perks to make more gol, make friends faster, make stuff faster, etc
- steam achievements are not difficult to achieve, but some are somewhat grindy unless you plan ahead. i think roughly 140hrs until i get 100%.
- you can go to options menu to speed up or slow down the game at leisure 0.6-3x so waiting for time related events doesnt take forever.

2023-11-25,"this game started off so well, really seeming to be portia but better. but the more i play it, the more issues i'm having. i've got a lot of unconnected thoughts, so i'll list the good and bad then put a summary at the botom.

[b]good:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]oustanding character design, personality, and development.[/b]
seriously some of the most lovable npcs in gaming. everyone has a unique and very well developed personality, with their own backstories and character arc.
[*][b]interesting world with a great concept to base the game off of.[/b]
sandrock has a well thought out history, and you have the goal of showing up while it's getting run down and on the decline, and having to turn it around to make it prosper. you do this by building new things to make the town grow, by uncovering lost technology from the old world long destroyed by the day of the calamity, and by fighting off the growing desert.
[*][b]lots to do.[/b]
farm, build, grow your workshop, decorate, connect with the townspeople, play minigames, catch fish, explore ruins, fight monsters etc. you know what to expect from games like this, and this game manages to include a wide variety of content better than most.
[*][b]humour.[/b]
there's a lot of funny jokes, silliness, nice references, and all sorts that will make you smile.
[*][b]coziness.[/b]
the game is so damn pleasant. there's so many issues with it which i'll get to, but despite them all i still found myself having a great time up until towards the end. it's just such a nice world to be in, it's so lovely learning about all the characters and gradually improving the town and your own workshop. it's really nice.
[*][b]immersion.[/b]
bit of a weird one, but this is something this game does well i think. you can get so absorbed and lost in this world. i love games that have the ability to make me forget the real world and just live in this virtual one for a week or two. this game nailed that. the fact i have 130 hours played after only starting 12 days ago shows what i mean, lol.
[/list]


[b]bad:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]performance.[/b]
the game takes a solid 5-10 minutes to load. this is a constant issue. going from one place to another has a very long loading screen, and even when it finishes loading, very few entities have actually loaded. buildings, menus, npcs, and objects all take an extra minute or so to load. sometimes they just don't load at all, and you'll have to restart the game. i've never had so much issues with load times in a game.
[*][b]the game is extremely grindy and tedious.[/b]
i'm 130 hours in and not even made it halfway towards finishing some things. i'm not exaggerating. i'm still not even done with the story, and from what the achievements tell me, neither are 99% of the people playing the game. collecting resources is extremely repetitive and slow, so is crafting, so is befriending people, and fighting, and pretty much every aspect of the game. everything is painfully longwinded and drawn out, taking a ridiculously long time for little payoff.
[*][b]length.[/b]
i'm never one to complain about how long a game is, the more there is to do the happier i am. this game is the one exception to that. all the story points feel so disjointed. it could end at so many points, but it has to add a new twist or an entirely new and unrelated story every time, which adds an extra 30 hours to the game each time. why has the story gone from developing this town, to catching a bandit, to [spoilers]rescuing a rat princess, to fighting in a war[/spoilers]. it strays so so far from the starting point that it's hard to stay interested, and that brings me to my next point.
[*][b]story.[/b]
it starts off so good, but what on earth happened. at some point you need to stop and question if what you're doing makes sense, and this game just doesn't. the game throws plot twist after plot twist at you, without putting much thought into any of them. none of them make sense, none of them are good ideas, it just feels like it's elongating this already immensely long game for no actual benefit.
[*][b]quality.[/b]
the game is very janky, which i personally think is fine for the most part, but it's worth mentioning. combat has you zipping around erratically, you can walk up almost vertical walls, mounts controls awfully, camera movement during dialogue is very strange, every cutscene is broken if there's a sandstorm going on, sandstorms don't actually do anything, there are almost no quality of life features, lots of invisible walls, there's not much attention to detail, and many features of the game feel very barebones. there's a lot more i could mention but this is already too long. the game just feels very much like they set their ambitions higher than they're able to reach. the fact i've got myself softlocked twice, and just downloaded a week 2 update which fixes 90+ bugs says a lot about the game. it just isn't well made.
[*][b]multiplayer[/b]
when this game was announced, it was planned to have multiplayer. not long before the release of the game, they decided to change that, after already receiving backing and early access purchases from people who were promised the game would have multiplayer. the game now has the most barebones and pointless multiplayer you can ask for, with no story or any of what makes the game fun.
[/list]

to summarise, this game has so much potential. it's a lovely idea, with some elements like character development and world building done remarkably well. however, the poor quality of the game, slow detioration of the story, and incredibly monotonous gameplay results in a very mediocre overall experience.",11769,Game Started Portia Play Issues Lot Unconnected List Bad Summary Botom List Oustanding Character Design Personality Development Lovable Npcs Gaming Unique Developed Personality Backstories Character Arc Concept Base Game Sandrock History Goal Decline Prosper Building Town Grow Uncovering Lost Technology Destroyed Day Calamity Fighting Growing Desert Lots Farm Build Grow Workshop Decorate Connect Townspeople Play Minigames Catch Fish Explore Ruins Fight Monsters Expect Games Game Manages Include Wide Variety Content Humour Lot Funny Jokes Silliness Nice References Sorts Smile Coziness Game Damn Pleasant Issues Time Nice Lovely Learning Characters Gradually Improving Town Workshop Nice Immersion Bit Weird Game Absorbed Lost Love Games Ability Forget Real Live Virtual Week Game Nailed 130 Hours Played Starting 12 Days Lol List Bad List Performance Game Takes Solid 5 Minutes Load Constant Issue Loading Screen Finishes Loading Entities Loaded Buildings Menus Npcs Objects Extra Minute Load Load Restart Game Issues Load Times Game Game Extremely Grindy Tedious 130 Hours Halfway Finishing Exaggerating Story Achievements 99 People Playing Game Collecting Resources Extremely Repetitive Slow Crafting Befriending People Fighting Pretty Aspect Game Painfully Longwinded Drawn Ridiculously Time Payoff Complain Game Happier Game Exception Story Feel Disjointed Add Twist Unrelated Story Time Adds Extra 30 Hours Game Time Story Developing Town Catching Bandit Spoilers Rescuing Rat Princess Fighting War Spoilers Strays Starting Hard Stay Brings Story Starts Earth Happened Question Sense Game Game Throws Plot Twist Plot Twist Putting Sense Ideas Feels Elongating Immensely Game Actual Benefit Quality Game Janky Personally Fine Worth Mentioning Combat Zipping Erratically Walk Vertical Walls Mounts Controls Camera Movement Dialogue Strange Cutscene Broken Sandstorm Sandstorms Quality Life Features Lots Invisible Walls Attention Features Game Feel Barebones Lot Mention Game Feels Set Ambitions Reach Softlocked Downloaded Week 2 Update Fixes 90 Bugs Lot Game Multiplayer Game Announced Planned Multiplayer Release Game Decided Change Receiving Access Purchases People Promised Game Multiplayer Game Barebones Pointless Multiplayer Story Game Fun List Summarise Game Potential Lovely Idea Elements Character Development Building Remarkably Poor Quality Game Slow Detioration Story Incredibly Monotonous Gameplay Mediocre Experience,POSITIVE,1,0,82,9,0.9010989010989011
2023-11-24,"[h2]ahoy![/h2]

this be ye local piratical reviewer comin' to tell ye if my time at sandrock be worth your precious doubloons or whether she be sent down to the briny depths!

i want to tell ye first, i've played the predecessor my time at portia to completin' and will be makin' some comparisons between 'em, i'll also be splittin' me thoughts into ayes 'n nays for easy readin'

[h3]ayes[/h3]

[b]a real sense o' progression[/b]
my time at sandrock (mtas) nails that sense of progression that my time at portia (mtap) pioneered. as ye be making ye adventures, ye'll be changing sandrock, from buildin' cranes te' fixing the hydrogel, expanding the yakmel network to more serious ventures like plantin' forests in the desert and building the road to portia. 

for each quest chain ye complete, you'll get reminders just how far ye've came. making ye feel apart of the world, and ultimately it's my most favourite draw to mtas.

[b]craftin'[/b]
goin' hand in hand with makin' ye changes in sandrock, the crafting is an improvement upon mtap. ye have a bounty o' machines to be gettin' ye buildin. most days ye'll be havin' machines runnin' all day pumpin out manner o things for ye designs. ingots, screws, slabs, everything to be gettin' everythin' built. occasionally, you'll feel overwhelmed but honestly, i felt that it feed it the hectic job that is bein' a builder in mtas. ye'll eventually condense this into ye crown jewel near the end, the almighty factory.

[b]exploration[/b]
the world of sandrock is huge and thar be plenty to see and dive. you'll be prowlin' through dangerous ruins, fighting robots and mobs for parts ye need for your builds and ye'll be spendin' a fair chunk o' ye time in the abandoned ruins, bringin' up various ores and relics to both smelt and reassemble. i've got no complaints.

[b]the characters[/b]
in this pirates honest opinions, the characters in mtas shine far brighter then those in portia. every character has a small chain that details there daily lives and a insight to their personality. it added that depth to life and some reason to care about the characters compared to portia, the massively expanded amount of quests featured in mtas, really helped in this situation.

[h3]nays[/h3]

[b]combat[/b]
thar has been a' few changes to combat, however, it still be simplistic. you'll be finding yourself usin' the same strategies ye found in portia. ye'll be dodging the choreographed events, going in to break' em and then just devastating 'em. it's the same ole' song and dance. it be worse with guns, ye'll whip your pistol o' rifle and just stun lock and break your enemy in place, making short work out most o' everything. disappointin' really.

[b]performance[/b]
this be nay gay breakin' but ye'll certainly notice it in ye adventurin'. mtas doesn't play aswell as portia, ye have pop in galore, especially o' anything ye've added to the world via the quests. the game chugs in the town itself and has random slow downs in various places. it can detract from ye' experience.

the small positive is for me, is that the game has mostly been light on bugs and pathea has been on the ball since release. 

[b]dlc practices[/b]
i hated to be addin' this one but £4.49 for costumes for 4 characters and putting the favourites separate in individual packs is a practice that belongs in davey jones locker. either bundle them together for a tenner or reduce the price of the individuals. currently it looks a cash grab and add as a tarnish to this shining treasure.

[h3]conclusion n' scoring[/h3]
mtas is a large game and it's hard to condense everything inte' a few paragraphs. it's a massive improvement on mtap. if ye loved that game, ye'll be right at home here. a no brainer for ye doubloons.

if ye the kind of sailor that loves a solid sense o' progression with an in-depth crafting system, memorable characters and a massive chain of quests to go on and doesn't mind some minor annoyances and lacklustre combat system. ye'll definitely find some good sailing 'ere.

i give mtas a solid 8.5/10 gold doubloons. a massive improvement over portia if not marred by spotty performance and cheap dlc tactics.",9744,H2 Ahoy H2 Local Piratical Reviewer Comin Time Sandrock Worth Precious Doubloons Briny Depths Played Predecessor Time Portia Completin Makin Comparisons Em Splittin Ayes Nays Easy Readin H3 Ayes H3 Real Sense Progression Time Sandrock Mtas Nails Sense Progression Time Portia Mtap Pioneered Adventures Changing Sandrock Buildin Cranes Te Fixing Hydrogel Expanding Yakmel Network Ventures Plantin Forests Desert Building Road Portia Quest Chain Complete Reminders Feel Ultimately Favourite Draw Mtas Craftin Goin Hand Hand Makin Sandrock Crafting Improvement Mtap Bounty Machines Gettin Buildin Days Havin Machines Runnin Day Pumpin Manner Designs Ingots Screws Slabs Gettin Everythin Built Occasionally Feel Overwhelmed Honestly Feed Hectic Job Bein Builder Mtas Eventually Condense Crown Jewel Almighty Factory Exploration Sandrock Huge Thar Plenty Dive Prowlin Dangerous Ruins Fighting Robots Mobs Builds Spendin Fair Chunk Time Abandoned Ruins Bringin Ores Relics Smelt Reassemble Complaints Characters Pirates Honest Opinions Characters Mtas Shine Brighter Portia Character Chain Details Daily Lives Insight Personality Depth Life Reason Care Characters Compared Portia Massively Expanded Quests Featured Mtas Helped Situation H3 Nays H3 Combat Thar Combat Simplistic Finding Usin Strategies Portia Dodging Choreographed Events Break Em Devastating Em Ole Song Dance Worse Guns Whip Pistol Rifle Stun Lock Break Enemy Short Disappointin Performance Gay Breakin Notice Adventurin Mtas Play Aswell Portia Pop Galore Quests Game Chugs Town Random Slow Detract Experience Positive Game Light Bugs Pathea Ball Release Dlc Practices Hated Addin 4 49 Costumes 4 Characters Putting Favourites Separate Individual Packs Practice Belongs Davey Jones Locker Bundle Tenner Reduce Price Individuals Cash Grab Add Tarnish Shining Treasure H3 Conclusion Scoring H3 Mtas Game Hard Condense Inte Paragraphs Massive Improvement Mtap Loved Game Brainer Doubloons Sailor Loves Solid Sense Progression Depth Crafting Memorable Characters Massive Chain Quests Mind Minor Annoyances Lacklustre Combat Sailing Ere Mtas Solid 8 5 Gold Doubloons Massive Improvement Portia Marred Spotty Performance Cheap Dlc Tactics,POSITIVE,1,0,139,6,0.9586206896551724

2023-11-23,"one of my favorite games of all time. has the most complex social aspects i've seen in a game and what we usually all wanted for years with life sim games. other devs should take notes, honestly. 

the best part about this game: there is always plenty things to do, and they are all fun and useful, a lot of life sim games might have you build useless things. almost everything you build gets used in events, main story content, bridges to unlock new areas, oh, and there is always new places being unlocked as you progress, immersive atmosphere, new characters being introduced, and i mean years in-game. 408 hrs (continued from early access save) and i am still unlocking new characters, areas, story content.

all the characters are well voice and well written. and by well written---really, well written. i don't think i can play a harvest moon or story of seasons game after this tbh. it's spoiled me. the characters are fleshed out wonderfully, with their own thought out pasts, stories, you can talk about them in convo during play dates, or romantic ones. some characters have reverse confessions and characters have romance and friendship quests as well as multiple in story quests where other characters will talk and interact with you and eachother. i guarantee you will feel some emotion for every single one of these characters. characters i didn't like or care about before i got to know i grew to like later, their flaws and their traits both, and their stories. 

this is one of the most immersive games i've experienced. it makes you feel apart of the community, and the seratonin boosts you get just from speaking to villagers, getting gifts outside your house on your birthday or wedding day, having your partner ask if you'd like to spend the day together after marriage and take you on little dates when most games are like 'they are married, have kids' and it's either the end, or they are blank nobodies now that have no more content whatsoever! this game doesn't do that. 

if sandrock gets more content dlc or in the next my time game, if they decide to have a kid system, i'd rather no kids unless there is real content for them, this is what the people want pathea, even if you charge $ for it:

-family outings/content and story events with your child/partner, and with the townsfolk
-the child going to school/interacting with other children
-old enough to speak properly/help out around the work shop or be interested in another profession/maybe story content for the kid following qi or owen around if they wanted to work as a scientist apprentice/at the blue moon as a chef or waiter or something.  ((not neccessary, just would be super cute. i would just rather not have kids in a game, like how stardew did unless they have content, sandrock still beat the others for sure though.)) and maybe a better child system to know when your child needs something/bring them with you on a baby backpack or hire a babysitter if you can't be home.

i'm definitely doing another playthrough. it's easy to miss dialogue and content because there is so much((this is a good thing.)) we got so lucky with my time at sandrock and i feel like i would 100% die for any of the sandrockers fr. the story gets better and better. sometimes it's silly, sometimes it's serious, sometimes it's just fun. 

characters you befriend will someetimes show up outside your house because they miss you and want to hang out, and sometimes you will see a lot of ! events to unlock, where you can say to much is going on right now and get to it later.

you might walk into someones home and they are eating dinner together, arvios sister is visiting him, or the preacher is teaching jasmine how to speak politely if she didn't like an authors book. little details that bring life

oh, and don't get me started on the holidays. only game i cared about holidays. you have mini games on almost every one, from collecting ingredients on a yakmel and can bump into other people, grilling up food for the towns folk, a dance competition, and so much more.

on dates with friends and romantically, you can set off fireworks in a fun pattern of your choosing, draw in the sand, play whack a mole or games at the arcade, sit and talk on a bench or go out to eat and order them food. you can befriend folks easily without gift spamming. talking to them, being yourself and taking commissions/work on the request or commission board they asked for is helpful. some characters might need to unlock events to get there story or even be able to give gifts to them if they are more to themselves.

the personalities are well thought out. characters with pasts, multiple hobbies likes and dislikes, where most games the 'fisherman' is just a fisherman and nothing more, his entire personality. you will hear them talk about their family, their other interests, and things they like. the characters entire personality isnt just a trope or based around 1 thing. this is the best character development as well for some characters i've seen in a long time. i highly reccomend buying this. it will be a blast constantly.

usually life sims have moments when your bored. well 400 hrs in and still constant content. i'm just saying....i hope this becomes the new standard for life sims xd

2023-11-23,"i don't leave reviews often so let me explain why i am this time first then i'll talk about sandrock.  back in 2014 i bought pathea's (first?  think so?) game called planet explorers.  i loved it at first but it had such a long development then in 2016 they ""full released"" the game, all while i still encountered game breaking bugs in the first 10min of gameplay that i had when i first started the game in '14.  coming off of also getting burned on several other steam greenlight games (yall remember that s**t?!), i swore that i would never, ever, buy another pathea game again..... then in 2018 i saw this cute game pop up in my feed called my time at portia, i was immediately in love with the art style and premise of the game and bought immediately, somehow missing the pathea logos and name the entire time.  by the time i realized that they were made by the same devs i had like some 100+hrs in portia and exhausted all the content even available at the time.  i did become a bit doomer and just awaited it to just disappear into history as another abandoned game.... well i have 300+ hours in portia now and it ranks as one of my favorite games of all time.  so firstly, i want to thank pathea games for doing a complete flip in my book and coming out with absolute bangers that have lost me many hours in workshop (my real one not the one in game, that workshop gets overused!)

now, lets talk about sandrock specifically (no story spoilers dont worry).  i had no idea it was even coming until it was too late to even back it on kickstarted and i hated myself for it!  i mean look at sandrock!  it has everything i love portia and then just completely redid it or made it even better.  the art style is such a nice thing to look at, the animations feel so much more complete and the gameplay feels nice and balanced and gives you full freedom to play how you will with very little in the way of forcing progress except when you really want to.  don't wanna go ultra super heavy into making your workshop mega and just wanna socialize?  you got it!  or you can do what i do and take #1 builder before the first month is even over (suck it yan!). the characters are all so lovable or just absolutely memorable to me, pen is such a over the top dude, yan while being your main 'rival' doesn't like actively take commissions from you like higgins did (no more sprinting off to the guild to grab the good commissions before he does), and miguel as much as i don't like him like him i at least have an understanding of him and even at times sympathize with his views.  i was put off at first by how you get more resources from recyclers rather than just straight gather (which there is still plenty of!) but in time i grew to really enjoy that i could have all them crunching for copper while i go get iron.  everything about it feels so well thought and improved from portia while not feeling like they just ctrl+c ctrl+v.  while it does get tedious at first managing both water and fuel for machines it became second nature when i run over to machine to start new production to just auto fill with dregs and i rarely had an issue anymore of machine out of water/fuel(by the way never ever use your wood for fuel just go slap some powerstones or get some dregs, thank me later).  the greatest improvement imo is combat which feels leagues ahead of the combat i remember from portia and i actually like dungeon diving now (before it was more ugh ok i guess ill go...).  socializing also feels alot easier in this game, admittedly i tend to always put socializing on the back burner but in my now post release game everyone loves me.  the one thing i really complained about was it felt like i had not enough time to do everything i wanted because i had to run here or there to get things done but that got solved when i found the time slider, won't really help you crunch resources faster since those are timed to in game time, but it's easier to run home and start something to turn in a com without running out of time due to me spending time walking, i found that a .67 time setting to be a nice sweet spot for getting places without dragging a day too long.  

and on the story itself, again, no spoilers, but it's good, really good imo.  it kept me hooked and interested the whole way, and also laughing because this game doesn't try to make everything so serious even in the more serious parts of the game (there's always a punch line xd). i got so excited in the last major update before release that i couldn't help myself but again play all through the twist and turns of what i think is the climax of the game (haven't full played on release yet so idk if theres even more after that!) and even after completing it i didn't feel like i was done or satisfied, there was still more work to do, still more commissions to get and more to build and to get sandrock back to its former glory (and even better!).  before release, i had just shy of 300hrs in sandrock and in the past 2 weeks, even with my bloated work schedule these days ive blown 80hrs in my new playthough and i can definately see myself blowing another 300 on this game before i get 'tired' of it. 

the tldr of it is, yes, buy this game.  you'll love it, play how you want to play, don't get the biggest baddest workshop if you dont want to, dont socialize alot if you dont want to.  or do!  sit back, relax, take a load off your mind and just create and have fun or go full try hard and show that yan dude whose the real newbie.  and pathea, from the just in my opinion let down of planet explorers, you have my eternal gratitude for portia and sandrock and you have won me fully back and just eager for the day the next my time at x game comes out (highwind!? altara? i mean coooommmmee ooooonnnn!!!)

2023-11-23,"[h1]i liked it.[/h1]
i liked portia, and i liked this game. just finished it! lots to do, the story is much more significant than i expected. thumbs up.

...with caveats. i had hoped that this time around we'd be able to avoid some of the pitfalls that portia had, and there were exotic new pitfalls to enjoy as well.

[h2]spoilers ahead, sorry. skip to conclusion for non-spoilery assessment[/h2]

[h3]the good[/h3]
[list]
[*]unsuur
[*]lots of story content, more than portia
[*]you get to feel epic as the townies come to respect you
[*]the civil corps of sandrock acknowledges you as an honorary member instead of pretending for the entire game that they are stronger than you in spite of your combat prowess like the civil corps of portia did
[*]didn't rely pretty much at all on any of the old workshop machines from the old game, and new models where there was overlap
[*]had a much more effective environmental message, where portia kind of deliberately put you at odds with the environmentalists in the game while trying to talk about the importance of environmentalism
[*]some (some) of the voice acting was pretty good
[*]i liked the weapon variety and specialization you could do through knowledge points
[*]did a decent job of making it so you could stop hunting for older, low-level ore and minerals while still making you track down new ores and occasional rarities like engines and stuff.
[*]datable men in this game are way hotter than in portia. so are the women, but the glow-up award goes to the guys. much better fleshed out personalities across the board too.
[*]i really liked hanging out and dating being instant instead of scheduled for a specific time the next day.

[*]there is no contest whatsoever in the builder rankings. i beat yan in year one without trouble, and in year two mi-an didn't come close. i could have done just one commission a day and i still would have been miles ahead. i expected mi-an to surge ahead to at least claim some yan-level numbers once yan wasn't taking credit for all her work, but she just wasn't remotely a threat.

[*]what the hell happened to the factory? in portia it had an awesome animated interior and dedicated upgrade options. in sandrock it's an ugly living room with all your machines crammed into it as cramped as you can manage. in portia it worked with the automated half of your assembly station, but in sandrock you wish you could just delete your assembly station entirely because you'll never use it again.

[*]sandrock fails in multiple instances to teach you about functions of the game. i never once learned to use a camera, so i had a whopping zero photos at the end of the game. i was made aware of the existence of parties thanks to the resources i had to make them go over well, but i only learned from the end credits that i was supposed to purchase and set up a banquet table to unlock this feature. i discovered that many of the datable npcs have outfit options in the social menu. i never found out how to make those happen. the fashion show seemed like the time for that to unlock, but the outfits were never made purchaseable, despite barber guy's enthusiasm about selling them in his dialogue. i thought maybe it was dlc, but it turns out it's not, so how was that meant to unlock? maybe after you marry them? nope. still no idea.

pacing issues

[*]i earned a greenhouse before i was ever able to develop a single tile of biocrust naturally, despite nonstop gardening starting the moment gardening was available. even without the greenhouse, the main story gifted me enough biocrust to make generating it manually a pointless feature.
[*]i was excited to get my max-level spear, but i earned the laser sword before i could make one and it was the indisputable optimal choice, rendering my knowledge points in spears worthless
[*]in portia the final build, a plane, blindsides you with a sudden need for truckloads of crystals you never thought to harvest before and makes you take in-game weeks just waiting for them to spawn so you can finish the quest. sandrock's elegant answer to this problem is to make the final build embarrassingly easy to complete. you'll probably have it finished in an afternoon with materials you had laying around. please, by all means, send me on a couple days of fetching to get the parts i need for this once-in-a-game build. they're never going to ask for another one, so make them unique items that i need to fight some boss monsters to obtain or something. i don't know, but ""a single expedition's worth of nanomaterial scrap and poplar wood and (checks notes) an item made a tiny amount of copper and bronze"" can't possibly be the best answer.
[*]in both portia and sandrock, the factory is a double-edged sword. it feels awesome to unlock godmode in your workshop, but you'll never have to think meaningfully about any commissions or build quests again. that's the day you go from bustling builder to rare material scavenger, and there's no going back, really. it was also too cheap and easy to have a factory in this game. couple grand, you're good to go. at least in portia you had to gather a mess of expensive materials and pony up the cash.
[*]you'll have the max-level workshop equipment by about the halfway point of the game. upgrading feels nice, so it's sad when this goes away so soon.

[h3]conclusion[/h3]
this is a fundamentally fun game that, like its predecessor, is deeply flawed. it has heart, but it feels unfinished in a way i know they're not going to fix. i had hoped portia would serve as a learning experience that would lead to sandrock being far more optimized out the gate. instead, it's genuinely unclear if they learned much of anything from portia's issues.

would i buy a new entry in this series in the future? well... probably. because they did at least prove they have some fun new ideas that do iterate successfully on the ""my time at"" formula. but at this point pathea is cementing itself in my head as a studio with a lot of muscle in the ideas department, but anemic in the polish department. the public is growing weary of studios that can't release a finished game.",9123,H1 H1 Portia Game Finished Lots Story Expected Thumbs Caveats Hoped Time Avoid Pitfalls Portia Exotic Pitfalls Enjoy H2 Spoilers Skip Conclusion Spoilery Assessment H2 H3 H3 List Unsuur Lots Story Content Portia Feel Epic Townies Respect Civil Corps Sandrock Acknowledges Honorary Pretending Entire Game Stronger Spite Combat Prowess Civil Corps Portia Rely Pretty Workshop Machines Game Models Overlap Effective Environmental Message Portia Deliberately Odds Environmentalists Game Talk Environmentalism Voice Acting Pretty Weapon Variety Specialization Knowledge Decent Job Hunting Level Ore Minerals Track Ores Occasional Rarities Engines Stuff Datable Game Hotter Portia Women Glow Award Guys Fleshed Personalities Board Hanging Dating Instant Scheduled Specific Time Day List H3 Bad H3 List Arvio Model Permanent Feature Landscape Takes Time Load Bit Voice Acting Sound Design Questionable Bad Pacing Weird Dating Hanging Fun Contest Whatsoever Builder Rankings Beat Yan Trouble Mi Close Commission Day Miles Expected Mi Surge Claim Yan Level Yan Credit Remotely Threat Variety Commissions Metal Ingots Metal Plates Stone Slabs Petrified Wood Planks Sticks Canvas Reward Climbing Stars People Commissioning Built Stuff Happened Factory Portia Awesome Animated Interior Dedicated Upgrade Options Sandrock Ugly Living Machines Crammed Cramped Manage Portia Automated Assembly Station Sandrock Delete Assembly Station Powerstone Grade Impossible Dregs Love Merle Goat Rambo Horns Upgrade Abandoned Ruins Goggles Outline Items Scan Scannable Item Diamond Indicator Outline Portia Issue Sandrock Fails Multiple Instances Teach Functions Game Learned Camera Whopping Photos Game Aware Existence Parties Resources Learned Credits Supposed Purchase Set Banquet Table Unlock Feature Discovered Datable Npcs Outfit Options Social Menu Happen Fashion Time Unlock Outfits Purchaseable Barber Guy Enthusiasm Selling Dialogue Dlc Meant Unlock Marry Nope Idea Grace Custom Pet Married Called Sugar Genuinely Unsure Items Donate Museum Item Slots House Builder Interface Janky Quit Items Refuse Bring Interaction Options Unmovable Unresizable Plain Disappear Errant Workshop Machine Bother Checking Inventory Workshop Machine Menu Builder Interface Mailbox Ass Item Head House Builder Remember List Pacing Issues List Earned Greenhouse Develop Single Tile Biocrust Naturally Nonstop Gardening Starting Moment Gardening Greenhouse Main Story Gifted Biocrust Generating Manually Pointless Feature Excited Max Level Spear Earned Laser Sword Indisputable Optimal Choice Rendering Knowledge Spears Worthless Portia Final Build Plane Blindsides Sudden Truckloads Crystals Harvest Game Weeks Waiting Spawn Finish Quest Sandrock Elegant Answer Final Build Embarrassingly Easy Complete Finished Afternoon Materials Laying Send Couple Days Fetching Game Build Unique Items Fight Boss Monsters Single Expedition Worth Nanomaterial Scrap Poplar Wood Checks Notes Item Tiny Copper Bronze Answer Portia Sandrock Factory Double Edged Sword Feels Awesome Unlock Godmode Workshop Meaningfully Commissions Build Quests Day Bustling Builder Rare Material Scavenger Cheap Easy Factory Game Couple Grand Portia Gather Mess Expensive Materials Pony Cash Max Level Workshop Equipment Halfway Game Upgrading Feels Nice Sad List H3 Conclusion H3 Fundamentally Fun Game Predecessor Deeply Flawed Heart Feels Unfinished Hoped Portia Serve Learning Experience Lead Sandrock Optimized Gate Genuinely Unclear Learned Portia Issues Entry Series Future Prove Fun Ideas Iterate Time Formula Pathea Cementing Head Studio Lot Muscle Ideas Department Anemic Polish Department Public Growing Weary Studios Release Finished Game,POSITIVE,1,0,147,16,0.901840490797546
2023-11-22,"mtas is, from the get-go, very similar to its predecessor my time at portia and for the most part that holds true as this was supposed to be an expansion before turning into a separate project.

does it separate itself enough to warrant a separate purchase? i believe so, although i believe the price increased since early access when i purchased it.

initially i was put off by the chosen setting as having a farming game be set in a desolate desert setting seemed like a tall order but the developers managed to introduce new mechanics to account for this without removing one of the core parts of the original game. i will not go into detail as some of these mechanics are also tied to the story which is appreciated as well. they may seem a bit tedious at the beginning but eventually as with the previous games most of the energy/water requirements become trivial from simply farming out other resources which i find to be nice as the game is already pretty grindy as its predecessor was in some aspects. a quick tip: do try to get a pet asap as they help a ton.
how grindy the game feels however depends on what you as the player would like to do and how stressed you feel about worker of the month/year nominations. if you want to keep ahead you will be farming 3-4 commissions daily as well as blowing all your stamina in abandoned ruins which can become a bit of a repetitive chore (for me this feeling started somewhere around winter 1st year). in order to avoid this i would recommend engaging with other parts of the game as well (hangouts/romance/building the house/farm) and not feeling like you need to squeeze out every ounce of stamina out of every day otherwise you will burn out quickly.

in terms of the story i still have not reached the complete conclusion but i believe nobody expected this game to bring out a game of the year contender in this regard.
if there is one thing however i would say that the pacing feels off for me. lot of the progression is gated by arbitrary amounts of days that have to pass in order for you to even receive an email that will tell you (at the beginning of a given day) that the story will continue 2 days from now. after those 2 days pass you usually go to a fireside meeting where they will say something usually followed by another day or 2 of waiting which became a real point of frustration as i already blew through all the mining/building content and needed story to progress to access the 3rd abandoned ruins which never seem to come. at this point i am in year 2 spring and i have been done with all that 2nd abandoned ruins offer in year 1 day 26 autumn which means i spent most of winter just running around hoping a side-quest would appear or the story would hurry up and come but it never did as from what i read i am still a few mysterious letters off from actually getting to the ruins. feels like i am being drip fed story at this point which would be fine if i was not done with everything i can do in a given day at about 3pm with plenty of time to spare.

hangouts/romance are pretty similar to what they were in portia but i appreciate the variety of characters that are available although i do miss papa bear. i thought sandy was going to be a nice replacement for papa bear for me but the sound that camel makes evoke some primordial feelings of horror in me so i avoid her usually.
one thing that i find odd is how easy it is to become a bff with heidi specifically since many of the commissions are from her so even if i do not really care about her she is my best friend stat-wise since avoiding her commissions would be hamstringing my progress too much. of course with addition of a bounty board this levels out a bit as those requests (at least in my experience) came from a variety of characters usually not requesting standard commissions like elsie for example who in my play-through appeared on standard commission board maybe twice with a incredibly simple request that yields almost no rewards.

all in all it might seem like i am airing my grievances with the game which is true but i still really like it for what it is. it may not be perfect owing to the points above or the bugs which still plague it but i do believe it is a great experience for people who liked the first game and builds upon it well. the grind feels satisfying when done in moderation and there are a lot of options for customizing your yard and house. romance options are plenty and compared to the first game there seem to be more post-marriage content.
i do hope future brings more bugfixes and even content if we should be so lucky.

p.s.
if a sequel ever comes i do hope for a different environment though as portia was also 1/3 if not 1/2 desert which i understand is a rather major plot point in the overall story but i am kind of over sand now, thanks.",9290,Mtas Predecessor Time Portia Holds True Supposed Expansion Separate Project Separate Warrant Separate Purchase Price Increased Access Purchased Initially Chosen Setting Farming Game Set Desolate Desert Setting Tall Developers Managed Introduce Mechanics Account Removing Core Original Game Mechanics Tied Story Appreciated Bit Tedious Eventually Previous Games Energy Water Requirements Trivial Simply Farming Resources Nice Game Pretty Grindy Predecessor Aspects Quick Pet Asap Ton Grindy Game Feels Depends Player Stressed Feel Worker Month Nominations Farming 3 4 Commissions Daily Blowing Stamina Abandoned Ruins Bit Repetitive Chore Feeling Started Winter 1St Avoid Recommend Engaging Game Hangouts Romance Building House Farm Feeling Squeeze Ounce Stamina Day Burn Terms Story Reached Complete Conclusion Expected Game Bring Game Contender Regard Pacing Feels Lot Progression Gated Arbitrary Amounts Days Pass Receive Email Day Story Continue 2 Days 2 Days Pass Fireside Meeting Day 2 Waiting Real Frustration Blew Mining Building Content Story Progress Access 3Rd Abandoned Ruins 2 Spring 2Nd Abandoned Ruins Offer 1 Day 26 Autumn Spent Winter Running Hoping Quest Story Hurry Read Mysterious Letters Ruins Feels Drip Fed Story Fine Day 3Pm Plenty Time Spare Hangouts Romance Pretty Portia Variety Characters Papa Bear Sandy Nice Replacement Papa Bear Sound Camel Evoke Primordial Feelings Horror Avoid Odd Easy Bff Heidi Commissions Care Friend Stat Wise Avoiding Commissions Hamstringing Progress Addition Bounty Board Levels Bit Requests Experience Variety Characters Requesting Standard Commissions Elsie Play Appeared Standard Commission Board Incredibly Simple Request Yields Rewards Airing Grievances Game True Perfect Bugs Plague Experience People Game Builds Grind Feels Satisfying Moderation Lot Options Customizing Yard House Romance Options Plenty Compared Game Post Marriage Content Hope Future Brings Bugfixes Content Lucky Sequel Hope Environment Portia 1 3 1 2 Desert Understand Major Plot Story Sand,POSITIVE,1,0,247,20,0.9250936329588015

- tree art has meshes that don't line up where it would appear ""chopped"" at the trunk. 
- the voice acting is either fantastic, or fantastically bad. if the actors have really thick native accents, don't tell them to sound country! it doesn't work! just have them speak in their native accent, it sounds fine and doesn't break immersion in a post calamity fantasy world. 
- do one more quality pass over your writing and dialogue, possibly with a native english speaker. there's some easy mistakes in the text/speech that can cause a lot of confusion. 
- fix the pop-in of assets! even if you have to force another second of load time for the player. i've gotten stuck in things that haven't appeared yet - especially on holidays. 
- don't automatically have the player start chopping a tree that they shouldn't be chopping! i don't want to be punished in game for doing something that i didn't mean to do in the first place.

[i]my time at sandrock[/i] takes all the good ideas of its predecessor which felt accidentally good at many times, and elevates them so you can make no mistake that pathea are actually a really talented and hardworking company that knows what they're doing. is it free of jank? no, not really. but it's so chockful of good things that even the jank becomes charming. it has a great, interesting story full of characters with vibrant personalities and not the paper-thin cutouts you get in [i]stardew valley[/i]. the world of the setting is so fully realized despite the series' cartoony nature and you feel excited to explore and learn about it. it is genuinely laugh out loud funny at many points, and genuinely emotional at others. i have to give it up for the vas who don't seem like professionals but are still giving their best. the building gameplay while its core loop is the same, sees a lot of qol improvements. the combat is more dynamic and offers a bit of challenge though it's still on the casual side. there's so many small charming details too, like when you go on dates in-game, they put in an animation where your significant other holds your hand. they didn't have to do that. it has no mechanical value. it's just cute and it makes you feel good.

stuff like that is why i think most of all, what the game nails is that it makes it good to be in sandrock, and to see sandrock grow. everyone who plays games for long enough understands the feeling where a place in a game becomes like a real place we have visited and been in, and we feel a sort of nostalgia seeing it. i think sandrock will feel that way to many people playing the game, it's such a wonderfully crafted setting, and it really fulfills the promise of the genre of ""life sim"" where you can take a break from reality and live somewhere else for a little while. i'm not even done with the main story. i restarted with 1.0 to experience it as intended since in beta lots of the quests squished together in buggy ways as they were implemented, but i feel glad to have done that. this is gonna be a game i will have good memories of and consider a favorite years from now.

p.s. just to be clear, i'm only really reviewing the single-player experience. i have not tried and am not that fussed about multiplayer.",9327,Time Portia Real Surprise Played Pretty Bundle Looked Repurposed Assets Korean Mmo 2010 Unexpectedly Feature Rich Game Post Apocalyptic Worldbuilding Gameplay Genuinely Ideas Combining Day Day Cycle Socializing Harvest Moon Softer Factory Game Mechanics Combat Content Fun Jank Time Sandrock Takes Ideas Predecessor Accidentally Times Elevates Mistake Pathea Talented Hardworking Company Jank Chockful Jank Charming Story Characters Vibrant Personalities Paper Cutouts Stardew Valley Setting Realized Series Cartoony Nature Feel Excited Explore Learn Genuinely Laugh Loud Funny Genuinely Emotional Vas Professionals Building Gameplay Core Loop Lot Qol Improvements Combat Dynamic Offers Bit Challenge Casual Charming Details Dates Game Animation Holds Hand Mechanical Cute Feel Stuff Game Nails Sandrock Sandrock Grow Plays Games Understands Feeling Game Real Visited Feel Sort Nostalgia Sandrock Feel People Playing Game Wonderfully Crafted Setting Fulfills Promise Genre Life Sim Break Reality Live Main Story Restarted 1 0 Experience Intended Beta Lots Quests Squished Buggy Implemented Feel Glad Gonna Game Memories Favorite Reviewing Single Player Experience Fussed Multiplayer,POSITIVE,1,0,165,11,0.9375
2023-11-19,"i am recommending this game because a friend of mine recommends it. 

but i have one big thing to say that may affect if you should buy this game or not.

if you want to play multiplayer, you are stuck to a singular character per server. you cannot have multiple characters on a server and thus if you p[ay with a friend, but want to play fresh with another friend- you either delete your current character and make a new one, or change to a different server and make one there. 

that is my only complaint, nor have i played the game enough to give any further context on the game.",13708,Recommending Game Friend Recommends Affect Game Play Multiplayer Stuck Singular Character Server Multiple Characters Server Ay Friend Play Fresh Friend Delete Current Character Change Server Complaint Played Game Context Game,POSITIVE,1,0,27,3,0.9
2023-11-17,"fantastic game, i immensely enjoyed my experience playing it. while not perfect, it massively improves on many aspects from its predecessor, my time at portia (mtap), while successfully experimenting with new ideas. most of my gripes with the game are largely small, inconsequential things, though there are a couple that really stood out as being almost impressively bad for such a great game. overall i loved it and i'm crushed that my play-through has ended. 8.5/10

[h3] pros [/h3]
 - huge boost in qol from mtap; inventory management is a dream, voiced dialogue is consistent instead of feeling random, you have more freedom to explore, and so on 
 - performance; i have a gtx 1070 and an i7700k so my rig is definitely aging...however i was easily able to keep my fps at 70+. the only dips were when most/all of the cast was on screen at once and was moving around (some firesides, but oddly not an issue during any of the festivals)
 - content; i just finished all the quests and my save file reads at 144 hours. there is a shockingly gargantuan amount of content to play through. while there are always ""fetch this"" quests, very few felt like their main purpose was to add filler *coughacvalhallacough* and the main quests carried a strong identity (sandrock is a dying town and constantly goes from crisis to crisis)
 - cast/writing; i felt most of the vas did a great job and overall the writing did a great job in both conveying humor and seriousness. every quest you take with justice + unsuur is full of golden dialogue, burgess is wonderfully self-aware, and so on.
 - music; a major step-up from mtap. i mean, the musical score for mtap wasn't bad per se...well the combat music and ruins exploration music were both pretty...okay everything but the sparring music was pretty mediocre (the sparring music slapped). mtas has a much, *much* better musical score in essentially every aspect.
 - impact; you as the protagonist have a large and meaningful impact in the game. sandrock goes through a food crisis, water crisis, vegetation crisis, and you can visually see the effects they have on the town, both before and after. it made me feel, in my opinion at least, like what i was doing was...purposeful, helpful. 
 - combat; they really stepped up the combat from mtap and it is a much smoother and more enjoyable experience. there are distinct weapon types: [strike] dual blades [/strike] daggers, greatsword, [strike] insect-less glaive [/strike] spear and [strike] sns [/strike] sword + shield, along with some guns, throwables, and a couple unique weapons. 
 - quality; less of a ""pro"" and more of ""not a con"", any game where items/gear posses quality tiers is fraught with danger. sandrock does a great job with quality (aside from the names, i mean ordinary -> oustanding -> perfect -> rare doesn't make sense to me). you can refine many items/weapons/gear to raise their level at the expense of a couple gems/minerals and it never feels like a brutal grind to do so....except for any item that wants agate to level up, agate sucks to get. literally everything else though is totally fine.
 - creativity; as mentioned sandrock is built on a pitifully small oasis. it used to be lush but has been almost entirely claimed by desertification. mechanically, the game requires you to use water to ""cool"" your machines (water being one of the very few parts of the game that remained an actual obstacle throughout the play through). you are not allowed to cut down any trees within the boundaries of sandrock proper (early game finding wood is a unique challenge). these, along with taking over a dozen kinds of scrap into the new recycling machines, do a fantastic job of mixing up game play and how new tiers of materials get introduced.

[h3] neutral [/h3] 
 - skill tree; your experience gets both added to a total, overall level (health/stamina) and divided into either social, gathering, workshop or combat based on where the xp was earned. this is a mixed bag for me because the perks are very obviously either ""must-haves"" (+1 break damage, +1 daily commission) or ""super terrible"" (any of the *many* perks that give you +10% xp/chance for/etc). the extra xp is bad because....

[h3] cons: [/h3] (review too long, only showing the two that plagued me)
 - difficulty; the game is easy. no, that's not fair. it is stunningly, disappointingly, shockingly easy. i'm not asking this to be dark souls; if i wanted that i'd...go play dark souls. what i mean is that i was over-leveled (>= 8 levels above) for 90% of the game,  and massively over-leveled (>= 14) for about 40% of it. the greater the level difference, the less damage is taken/received a-la borderlands style. immunity frames when dodging are [i] incredibly [/i] generous; you have i-frames for the entire animation and a little extra, meaning you can just chain rolls for invulnerability and you can lazily roll through the few environmental obstacles thrown at you. however, as you are far above the recommended level, you won't even be dodging because you barely get hurt. the bosses are actually well designed, far better than mtap...but again, you don't need to engage in any of their mechanics you are a much higher level than they. also there are 0 attacks that cannot be avoided by simply....running in a different direction. earned experience points are also far too generous. sparring pen and the dive buzzard near the railroad tracks were the only two fights that i felt challenged; every other combat experience was a cake-walk. pathea could slash all earned xp by 25% and *maybe* you'd fall into the recommended range, but only if you never explored, did side quests or commissions. this is why 40% of the skill tree feels pointless. every perk doesn't need to be in perfect balance...but i'm already stomping everything i do not need a 10% chance to get double experience for kicking trees. gear cannot be used it you are below it's specified level but, once more, that had 0 effect on my gameplay outside of the first couple in-game weeks. sandstorms are supposed to be deadly, you are told to either stay inside or don protective gear. spoiler, it doesn't matter. wear whatever you want. the game makes some light attempts into platforming (which were done well) with the exception of the massive arrows that always tell you where to go. i could go on; suffice it to say i loved so much of the game but i never really felt ""challenged"" at virtually any point.
 - path finding. i mean wow, i was blown away by how unbelievably abysmal the path finding is. i've watched sandrock residents get stuck walking into building corners, get stuck walking into plants, decorations, each other, things that are invisible to me yet inexplicably manifest a collision box, animals, fences...if it exists in game, they've gotten stuck on it. repeatedly. in the first 3 minutes of the game you are offered a tour by the ten-year-old jasmine who after saying, ""follow me"" immediately turns around and gets stuck on a rock. the ""solution"" was to cause a character to fade out and reappear after they fail to move in their desired direction for a couple seconds. they only sometimes do that. sometimes they just give up and stand there until something breaks their error loop (if you host a party expect to talk to everybody constantly so they dont freeze in place). sometimes the pathing routes of everybody (enemies included) get shifted. now the bumble ants that are on the hill 200 feet to the east of your workshop eternally try to path into your fence. if a sandrocker has been catastrophically shifted from their normal route you may watch as they teleport back and forth between two spots (looking at your pen, rocky and krystal). your children are a complete enigma and refuse to abide by any pathfinding laws. good luck trying to change that diaper

2023-11-16,"[h2] multiplayer feedback for my time at sandrock [/h2]

firstly, we want to express our appreciation for the unique multiplayer experience you've introduced in my time at sandrock. after investing over 50 hours+ into the game, my wife and i compiled our thoughts and feedback, focusing primarily on the multiplayer aspect. it's important to note that our feedback pertains exclusively to multiplayer, as we have yet to explore the single-player mode.

[b] let's delve into the areas that could use improvement: [/b]

[h3] 1. lack of freedom in a server-based world [/h3]
the introduction of a server-based world is both a blessing and a curse. while the ability to play even when the host is inactive is commendable, it restricts player freedom. in contrast to the multiplayer mechanics of [b]stardew valley[/b], where an account-based server offers players the freedom to modify the game using mods, console commands, and more, [b]my time at sandrock[/b] a sandbox multiplayer game focus falls short in this regard.
[list]
[*] comparison with stardew valley multiplayer

stardew valley allows mods and extensive customization, adding costumes to npcs, changing npc portraits, incorporating extra heart events, enhancing ui, introducing new characters, implementing console commands, even freezing time and more. the only limitation is the necessity for the host to be active, a trade-off that hasn't posed a significant issue, since i can just turn on my pc (i'm the host) and let them do whatever they want in the farm, even if my character faints due to lack of sleep, there are no adverse consequences or losses incurred because of the mods.

[*] impact on gameplay experience

the current server-based setup in [b]my time at sandrock[/b] detracts from the immersive storytelling experience. if one player is offline, progressing through quests and other activities becomes challenging due to the accelerated passage of in-game time. this time constraint induces stress rather than fostering a relaxing gameplay environment. the server is very strict when modifying our own world.
[/list]

[h3] 2. time progression does not stop in multiplayer mode even if you are alone. [/h3]
[list]
[*] a notable drawback of the server-based approach is that in multiplayer worlds with only one active player, time relentlessly marches on regardless if you are in menu mode, inventory, etc. this poses a challenge for players who meticulously plan and min-max their activities, especially when friends are offline. try to implement a ""private/account based"" multiplayer world, allowing players to host their own servers, would offer a solution to this predicament and empower players to play the game on their terms. ( some might say, stop playing and wait for your friends to get online ). 
[i]that would counter the fact that the multiplayer server-based is [b]useless[/b] since we have to wait for everyone to be online, right?[/i]
[/list]

[h3] 3. achievements and milestones in multiplayer [/h3]

[list]
[*] adding achievements to multiplayer mode seems to be a missed opportunity. while the game already features milestones, incorporating a system to track personal achievements and synchronizing them with steam achievements would enhance the multiplayer experience. if some achievement is only accessible in singleplayer, then we would have another reason to play the singleplayer mode.

[*] yes, you can play multiplayer mode for 500+ hours, complete everything you need and you still have 0/60 achievements. 
not cool.
[/list]

[h3] 4. shared storage challenges and quest completion [/h3]

[list]
[*] the existing shared storage system, offering capacities of 80(?), 120, and 300 at levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively, introduces significant challenges, particularly during the [b]early and mid-game phases[/b]. this challenge is accentuated in multiplayer scenarios where multiple players contribute to the shared storage. once the shared storage reaches its capacity, we're compelled to resort to ""personal storage,"" limiting access for other players.

[*] the inconvenience arises when different players hold distinct resources, gone offline then other players need those items for quests. they will have to farm again, since time does not stop. unlike the seamless, automatic quest item retrieval feature present in single-player mode, the multiplayer experience introduces additional complexities, requiring deliberate coordination among players to ensure efficient quest completion.
[/list]

[h3] final note [/h3]

since this review is heavily focused on the multiplayer mode, we regrettably find it necessary to vote ""do not recommend"" for players specifically seeking a satisfying multiplayer experience. we remain hopeful that future updates will address these concerns, and we are open to revising our review once improvements are implemented.",11028,H2 Multiplayer Feedback Time Sandrock H2 Firstly Express Appreciation Unique Multiplayer Experience Introduced Time Sandrock Investing 50 Hours Game Wife Compiled Feedback Focusing Multiplayer Aspect Note Feedback Pertains Exclusively Multiplayer Explore Single Player Mode Delve Improvement H3 1 Lack Freedom Server Based H3 Introduction Server Based Blessing Curse Ability Play Host Inactive Commendable Restricts Player Freedom Contrast Multiplayer Mechanics Stardew Valley Account Based Server Offers Players Freedom Modify Game Mods Console Commands Time Sandrock Sandbox Multiplayer Game Focus Falls Short Regard List Comparison Stardew Valley Multiplayer Stardew Valley Mods Extensive Customization Adding Costumes Npcs Changing Npc Portraits Incorporating Extra Heart Events Enhancing Ui Introducing Characters Implementing Console Commands Freezing Time Limitation Necessity Host Active Trade Posed Issue Pc Host Farm Character Faints Lack Sleep Adverse Consequences Losses Incurred Mods Impact Gameplay Experience Current Server Based Setup Time Sandrock Detracts Immersive Storytelling Experience Player Offline Progressing Quests Activities Challenging Accelerated Passage Game Time Time Constraint Induces Stress Fostering Relaxing Gameplay Environment Server Strict Modifying List H3 2 Time Progression Multiplayer Mode H3 List Notable Drawback Server Based Approach Multiplayer Worlds Active Player Time Relentlessly Marches Menu Mode Inventory Poses Challenge Players Meticulously Plan Min Max Activities Friends Offline Implement Private Account Based Multiplayer Allowing Players Host Servers Offer Solution Predicament Empower Players Play Game Terms Playing Wait Friends Online Counter Multiplayer Server Based Useless Wait Online List H3 3 Achievements Milestones Multiplayer H3 List Adding Achievements Multiplayer Mode Missed Opportunity Game Features Milestones Incorporating Track Personal Achievements Synchronizing Steam Achievements Enhance Multiplayer Experience Achievement Accessible Singleplayer Reason Play Singleplayer Mode Play Multiplayer Mode 500 Hours Complete 0 60 Achievements Cool List H3 4 Shared Storage Challenges Quest Completion H3 List Existing Shared Storage Offering Capacities 80 120 300 Levels 1 2 3 Introduces Challenges Mid Game Phases Challenge Accentuated Multiplayer Scenarios Multiple Players Contribute Shared Storage Shared Storage Reaches Capacity Compelled Resort Personal Storage Limiting Access Players Inconvenience Arises Players Hold Distinct Resources Offline Players Items Quests Farm Time Seamless Automatic Quest Item Retrieval Feature Single Player Mode Multiplayer Experience Introduces Additional Complexities Requiring Deliberate Coordination Players Ensure Efficient Quest Completion List H3 Final Note H3 Review Heavily Focused Multiplayer Mode Regrettably Vote Recommend Players Seeking Satisfying Multiplayer Experience Remain Hopeful Future Updates Address Concerns Revising Review Improvements Implemented,POSITIVE,1,0,35,4,0.8974358974358975

2023-11-11,"overall, i recommend the game - 480 hours played across early release - but that doesn't mean the game is perfect. much has been made of the voiceover issues with this game, so i'll bypass those, other than to add that changing the voiceover artist for later updates compounded the issue.

it's less clunky (although arguable less realistic, as a consequence) than its predecessor, my time at portia, which may make for a less than satisfying experience for anyone who chooses to play that game after this one. the characters in sandrock are less bobble-headed, too, which is an improvement. portia and sandrock happen in a simultaneous timelime, which leads to some quietly-amusing references to, effectively, your portia character at points during sandrock, another reason to consider playing portia first.

of the five bachelors i romanced, three of them exhibited behaviour that, in real life, should set major alarm bells ringing, which is quite concerning. a couple of the npcs are genuinely unlikeable, which is fine and reflective of real life; but i found myself resenting completing lucrative contracts for one of them by late game, as their relationship with me continued to increase even as my loathing of them grew.

as i did play this through early release, some things may have changed by full release, but a few niggly annoyances stood out: at times, lucrative commissions for machinery would appear on the commission board; but without having any in-game ability to know what was required to complete construction, it was quite frustrating to accept these commissions, research the manufacturing plans, discover you needed more advanced equipment yourself, research that, then find that you needed components you either didn't have materials for, or didn't have the ability to make. in one instance, the 'base' instructions for making the refined material i needed to make one component didn't even become available until nearly two months after i'd failed the commission. if the capacity to complete the commission doesn't exist, don't make it available.

secondly, there were times when it became impossible to complete tasks because the final act clashed with some other event. some of these may have since been resolved. in a related annoyance, there are times when the pc wakes up with awareness of events it is literally impossible for them to have any knowledge of. often this is minor: calendar events added on rising in the morning that are explained when mail is read. occasionally, however, these are quite significant. just as bed, there are some events involving npcs that clearly acknowledge the passage of a significant period of time (a minimum two weeks would be essential in one case), yet those events conclude within a day or so. then there is the issue of being 'transported' to major events when you get up. on one occasion, running back home after such an event, i encountered a minor task simply by talking with an npc that i had no means of answering because the task was outlined in a letter i hadn't yet had a chance to read. more concerningly, the non-committal answer i gave may have broken the character, who never moved from the spot i encountered him for the remainder of the game, unless needed elsewhere.

the nanny-nag that says ""you can't use that possibly rude word!"" when naming things in single-player is both ludicrous and offensive: i'm an adult, not six years old, and i can make my own decisions. if it's important that any vaguely-implied rudeness must be leapt on with extreme prejudice, then i would suggest that eliminating toxic behaviours from a multitude of npcs would be a better use of censorship - especially if (and i am forced to assume that this must be the case) the game makers are trying to avoid corrupting sweet childish innocence.

similarly, an in-game swimwear fashion show basically designed to sell dlcs is both sexist and cowardly in dressing the female models in bikins and the males in shorts. the game designers may have jumped on the 'it's okay to be gay"" bandwagon; but their moral code is severely lacking in other areas (most particularly regarding toxic behaviours).

one in-game shop has a link to actual character figurines on amazon: if you follow the link you find that you're being asked to pay an offensively-large amount of money for a blind-box figurine, so that's a definitive 'no' on both counts. still, that annoyance is easily-avoided, although it does make me less-inclined to consider buying other pathea games products, up to and including dlcs, so they may like to rethink their approach.

yes, i have concentrated on the negatives in this review. on the positive side, the game is immensely-playable. for an obsessive such as me, there is always something to do, with the essential wait-times scattered throughout the game usually not too much of a trial. some npcs are clearly on the autism spectrum, and this is treated respectfully (albeit occasionally with not-unreasonable impatience) by other npcs and player choices, which is to be commended. apart from some built-in sexism, the character design is generally appealing, and the capacity to 'hide the hat' via the settings is appreciated: having put a lot of effort into designing my character, i like being able to see them. the storylines are often engaging, although i wish the character-based relationship-building tasks had a time expiry if unselected, because having them sit constantly on the map when i have no interest in following them through is annoying.

in summary, an enjoyable, very playable game with a number of flaws, some of them significant.",18231,Recommend Game 480 Hours Played Release Game Perfect Voiceover Issues Game Bypass Add Changing Voiceover Artist Updates Compounded Issue Clunky Arguable Realistic Consequence Predecessor Time Portia Satisfying Experience Chooses Play Game Characters Sandrock Bobble Headed Improvement Portia Sandrock Happen Simultaneous Timelime Leads Quietly Amusing References Effectively Portia Character Sandrock Reason Playing Portia Bachelors Romanced Exhibited Behaviour Real Life Set Major Alarm Bells Ringing Couple Npcs Genuinely Unlikeable Fine Reflective Real Life Resenting Completing Lucrative Contracts Late Game Relationship Continued Increase Loathing Grew Play Release Changed Release Niggly Annoyances Stood Times Lucrative Commissions Machinery Commission Board Game Ability Required Complete Construction Frustrating Accept Commissions Manufacturing Plans Discover Advanced Equipment Components Materials Ability Instance Base Instructions Refined Material Component Months Failed Commission Capacity Complete Commission Exist Times Impossible Complete Tasks Final Clashed Event Resolved Annoyance Times Pc Wakes Awareness Events Literally Impossible Knowledge Minor Calendar Events Rising Morning Explained Mail Read Occasionally Bed Events Involving Npcs Acknowledge Passage Period Time Minimum Weeks Essential Events Conclude Day Issue Transported Major Events Occasion Running Event Encountered Minor Task Simply Talking Npc Answering Task Outlined Letter Chance Read Concerningly Committal Answer Broken Character Moved Spot Encountered Remainder Game Nanny Nag Rude Word Naming Single Player Ludicrous Offensive Adult Decisions Vaguely Implied Rudeness Leapt Extreme Prejudice Eliminating Toxic Behaviours Multitude Npcs Censorship Forced Assume Game Makers Avoid Corrupting Sweet Childish Innocence Game Swimwear Fashion Basically Designed Sell Dlcs Sexist Cowardly Dressing Female Models Bikins Males Shorts Game Designers Jumped Gay Bandwagon Moral Code Severely Lacking Toxic Behaviours Game Shop Link Actual Character Figurines Amazon Follow Link Pay Offensively Money Blind Box Figurine Definitive Counts Annoyance Easily Avoided Inclined Buying Pathea Games Products Including Dlcs Rethink Approach Concentrated Negatives Review Positive Game Immensely Playable Obsessive Essential Wait Times Scattered Game Trial Npcs Autism Spectrum Treated Respectfully Albeit Occasionally Unreasonable Impatience Npcs Player Choices Commended Built Sexism Character Design Appealing Capacity Hide Hat Settings Appreciated Lot Effort Designing Character Storylines Engaging Character Based Relationship Building Tasks Time Expiry Unselected Sit Constantly Map Annoying Summary Enjoyable Playable Game Flaws,POSITIVE,1,0,53,15,0.7794117647058824

2023-11-11,"this is a review on the multiplayer side of the game. i never tried the single player mode.
solid game. surprisingly large amount of content and good quality throughout. 

quest done almost always add value to your gameplay and town and not just a exp/gold farm like what quest in games usually do. grinding doesnt feel like a chore as you are rewarded well for it. as for how much things there is to do in the game, the only answer is yes. after 30hrs in, i still never run out of things to do, super addicting. 

combat is fairly simple and suit a game like this, where building and developing your town is the main goal. dungeons are pretty fun to go through, the bosses have mechanics and not just a mob with large hp pool which was surprising as well. however, most fights is just a stat fight (whether you have enough stats/heals), dodging doesnt feel that important in the game and it doesnt even feel rewarding to dodge attacks as you can just tank through everything anyways with enough stats and heals and kill the mob faster. however, it is understandable as it is a rather casual friendly game. however if the devs decide to make the combat more interactive rather than a stat fight in the future, i am all for it. also guns are fun and all, needing to use ads to shoot is not fantastic.

2023-11-19,"i am recommending this game because a friend of mine recommends it. 

but i have one big thing to say that may affect if you should buy this game or not.

if you want to play multiplayer, you are stuck to a singular character per server. you cannot have multiple characters on a server and thus if you p[ay with a friend, but want to play fresh with another friend- you either delete your current character and make a new one, or change to a different server and make one there. 

that is my only complaint, nor have i played the game enough to give any further context on the game.",13708,Recommending Game Friend Recommends Affect Game Play Multiplayer Stuck Singular Character Server Multiple Characters Server Ay Friend Play Fresh Friend Delete Current Character Change Server Complaint Played Game Context Game,POSITIVE,1,0,27,3,0.9
2023-11-17,"fantastic game, i immensely enjoyed my experience playing it. while not perfect, it massively improves on many aspects from its predecessor, my time at portia (mtap), while successfully experimenting with new ideas. most of my gripes with the game are largely small, inconsequential things, though there are a couple that really stood out as being almost impressively bad for such a great game. overall i loved it and i'm crushed that my play-through has ended. 8.5/10

[h3] pros [/h3]
 - huge boost in qol from mtap; inventory management is a dream, voiced dialogue is consistent instead of feeling random, you have more freedom to explore, and so on 
 - performance; i have a gtx 1070 and an i7700k so my rig is definitely aging...however i was easily able to keep my fps at 70+. the only dips were when most/all of the cast was on screen at once and was moving around (some firesides, but oddly not an issue during any of the festivals)
 - content; i just finished all the quests and my save file reads at 144 hours. there is a shockingly gargantuan amount of content to play through. while there are always ""fetch this"" quests, very few felt like their main purpose was to add filler *coughacvalhallacough* and the main quests carried a strong identity (sandrock is a dying town and constantly goes from crisis to crisis)
 - cast/writing; i felt most of the vas did a great job and overall the writing did a great job in both conveying humor and seriousness. every quest you take with justice + unsuur is full of golden dialogue, burgess is wonderfully self-aware, and so on.
 - music; a major step-up from mtap. i mean, the musical score for mtap wasn't bad per se...well the combat music and ruins exploration music were both pretty...okay everything but the sparring music was pretty mediocre (the sparring music slapped). mtas has a much, *much* better musical score in essentially every aspect.
 - impact; you as the protagonist have a large and meaningful impact in the game. sandrock goes through a food crisis, water crisis, vegetation crisis, and you can visually see the effects they have on the town, both before and after. it made me feel, in my opinion at least, like what i was doing was...purposeful, helpful. 
 - combat; they really stepped up the combat from mtap and it is a much smoother and more enjoyable experience. there are distinct weapon types: [strike] dual blades [/strike] daggers, greatsword, [strike] insect-less glaive [/strike] spear and [strike] sns [/strike] sword + shield, along with some guns, throwables, and a couple unique weapons. 
 - quality; less of a ""pro"" and more of ""not a con"", any game where items/gear posses quality tiers is fraught with danger. sandrock does a great job with quality (aside from the names, i mean ordinary -> oustanding -> perfect -> rare doesn't make sense to me). you can refine many items/weapons/gear to raise their level at the expense of a couple gems/minerals and it never feels like a brutal grind to do so....except for any item that wants agate to level up, agate sucks to get. literally everything else though is totally fine.
 - creativity; as mentioned sandrock is built on a pitifully small oasis. it used to be lush but has been almost entirely claimed by desertification. mechanically, the game requires you to use water to ""cool"" your machines (water being one of the very few parts of the game that remained an actual obstacle throughout the play through). you are not allowed to cut down any trees within the boundaries of sandrock proper (early game finding wood is a unique challenge). these, along with taking over a dozen kinds of scrap into the new recycling machines, do a fantastic job of mixing up game play and how new tiers of materials get introduced.

[h3] neutral [/h3] 
 - skill tree; your experience gets both added to a total, overall level (health/stamina) and divided into either social, gathering, workshop or combat based on where the xp was earned. this is a mixed bag for me because the perks are very obviously either ""must-haves"" (+1 break damage, +1 daily commission) or ""super terrible"" (any of the *many* perks that give you +10% xp/chance for/etc). the extra xp is bad because....

[h3] cons: [/h3] (review too long, only showing the two that plagued me)
 - difficulty; the game is easy. no, that's not fair. it is stunningly, disappointingly, shockingly easy. i'm not asking this to be dark souls; if i wanted that i'd...go play dark souls. what i mean is that i was over-leveled (>= 8 levels above) for 90% of the game,  and massively over-leveled (>= 14) for about 40% of it. the greater the level difference, the less damage is taken/received a-la borderlands style. immunity frames when dodging are [i] incredibly [/i] generous; you have i-frames for the entire animation and a little extra, meaning you can just chain rolls for invulnerability and you can lazily roll through the few environmental obstacles thrown at you. however, as you are far above the recommended level, you won't even be dodging because you barely get hurt. the bosses are actually well designed, far better than mtap...but again, you don't need to engage in any of their mechanics you are a much higher level than they. also there are 0 attacks that cannot be avoided by simply....running in a different direction. earned experience points are also far too generous. sparring pen and the dive buzzard near the railroad tracks were the only two fights that i felt challenged; every other combat experience was a cake-walk. pathea could slash all earned xp by 25% and *maybe* you'd fall into the recommended range, but only if you never explored, did side quests or commissions. this is why 40% of the skill tree feels pointless. every perk doesn't need to be in perfect balance...but i'm already stomping everything i do not need a 10% chance to get double experience for kicking trees. gear cannot be used it you are below it's specified level but, once more, that had 0 effect on my gameplay outside of the first couple in-game weeks. sandstorms are supposed to be deadly, you are told to either stay inside or don protective gear. spoiler, it doesn't matter. wear whatever you want. the game makes some light attempts into platforming (which were done well) with the exception of the massive arrows that always tell you where to go. i could go on; suffice it to say i loved so much of the game but i never really felt ""challenged"" at virtually any point.
 - path finding. i mean wow, i was blown away by how unbelievably abysmal the path finding is. i've watched sandrock residents get stuck walking into building corners, get stuck walking into plants, decorations, each other, things that are invisible to me yet inexplicably manifest a collision box, animals, fences...if it exists in game, they've gotten stuck on it. repeatedly. in the first 3 minutes of the game you are offered a tour by the ten-year-old jasmine who after saying, ""follow me"" immediately turns around and gets stuck on a rock. the ""solution"" was to cause a character to fade out and reappear after they fail to move in their desired direction for a couple seconds. they only sometimes do that. sometimes they just give up and stand there until something breaks their error loop (if you host a party expect to talk to everybody constantly so they dont freeze in place). sometimes the pathing routes of everybody (enemies included) get shifted. now the bumble ants that are on the hill 200 feet to the east of your workshop eternally try to path into your fence. if a sandrocker has been catastrophically shifted from their normal route you may watch as they teleport back and forth between two spots (looking at your pen, rocky and krystal). your children are a complete enigma and refuse to abide by any pathfinding laws. good luck trying to change that diaper

2023-11-16,"[h2] multiplayer feedback for my time at sandrock [/h2]

firstly, we want to express our appreciation for the unique multiplayer experience you've introduced in my time at sandrock. after investing over 50 hours+ into the game, my wife and i compiled our thoughts and feedback, focusing primarily on the multiplayer aspect. it's important to note that our feedback pertains exclusively to multiplayer, as we have yet to explore the single-player mode.

[b] let's delve into the areas that could use improvement: [/b]

[h3] 1. lack of freedom in a server-based world [/h3]
the introduction of a server-based world is both a blessing and a curse. while the ability to play even when the host is inactive is commendable, it restricts player freedom. in contrast to the multiplayer mechanics of [b]stardew valley[/b], where an account-based server offers players the freedom to modify the game using mods, console commands, and more, [b]my time at sandrock[/b] a sandbox multiplayer game focus falls short in this regard.
[list]
[*] comparison with stardew valley multiplayer

stardew valley allows mods and extensive customization, adding costumes to npcs, changing npc portraits, incorporating extra heart events, enhancing ui, introducing new characters, implementing console commands, even freezing time and more. the only limitation is the necessity for the host to be active, a trade-off that hasn't posed a significant issue, since i can just turn on my pc (i'm the host) and let them do whatever they want in the farm, even if my character faints due to lack of sleep, there are no adverse consequences or losses incurred because of the mods.

[*] impact on gameplay experience

the current server-based setup in [b]my time at sandrock[/b] detracts from the immersive storytelling experience. if one player is offline, progressing through quests and other activities becomes challenging due to the accelerated passage of in-game time. this time constraint induces stress rather than fostering a relaxing gameplay environment. the server is very strict when modifying our own world.
[/list]

[h3] 2. time progression does not stop in multiplayer mode even if you are alone. [/h3]
[list]
[*] a notable drawback of the server-based approach is that in multiplayer worlds with only one active player, time relentlessly marches on regardless if you are in menu mode, inventory, etc. this poses a challenge for players who meticulously plan and min-max their activities, especially when friends are offline. try to implement a ""private/account based"" multiplayer world, allowing players to host their own servers, would offer a solution to this predicament and empower players to play the game on their terms. ( some might say, stop playing and wait for your friends to get online ). 
[i]that would counter the fact that the multiplayer server-based is [b]useless[/b] since we have to wait for everyone to be online, right?[/i]
[/list]

[h3] 3. achievements and milestones in multiplayer [/h3]

[list]
[*] adding achievements to multiplayer mode seems to be a missed opportunity. while the game already features milestones, incorporating a system to track personal achievements and synchronizing them with steam achievements would enhance the multiplayer experience. if some achievement is only accessible in singleplayer, then we would have another reason to play the singleplayer mode.

[*] yes, you can play multiplayer mode for 500+ hours, complete everything you need and you still have 0/60 achievements. 
not cool.
[/list]

[h3] 4. shared storage challenges and quest completion [/h3]

[list]
[*] the existing shared storage system, offering capacities of 80(?), 120, and 300 at levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively, introduces significant challenges, particularly during the [b]early and mid-game phases[/b]. this challenge is accentuated in multiplayer scenarios where multiple players contribute to the shared storage. once the shared storage reaches its capacity, we're compelled to resort to ""personal storage,"" limiting access for other players.

[*] the inconvenience arises when different players hold distinct resources, gone offline then other players need those items for quests. they will have to farm again, since time does not stop. unlike the seamless, automatic quest item retrieval feature present in single-player mode, the multiplayer experience introduces additional complexities, requiring deliberate coordination among players to ensure efficient quest completion.
[/list]

[h3] final note [/h3]

since this review is heavily focused on the multiplayer mode, we regrettably find it necessary to vote ""do not recommend"" for players specifically seeking a satisfying multiplayer experience. we remain hopeful that future updates will address these concerns, and we are open to revising our review once improvements are implemented.",11028,H2 Multiplayer Feedback Time Sandrock H2 Firstly Express Appreciation Unique Multiplayer Experience Introduced Time Sandrock Investing 50 Hours Game Wife Compiled Feedback Focusing Multiplayer Aspect Note Feedback Pertains Exclusively Multiplayer Explore Single Player Mode Delve Improvement H3 1 Lack Freedom Server Based H3 Introduction Server Based Blessing Curse Ability Play Host Inactive Commendable Restricts Player Freedom Contrast Multiplayer Mechanics Stardew Valley Account Based Server Offers Players Freedom Modify Game Mods Console Commands Time Sandrock Sandbox Multiplayer Game Focus Falls Short Regard List Comparison Stardew Valley Multiplayer Stardew Valley Mods Extensive Customization Adding Costumes Npcs Changing Npc Portraits Incorporating Extra Heart Events Enhancing Ui Introducing Characters Implementing Console Commands Freezing Time Limitation Necessity Host Active Trade Posed Issue Pc Host Farm Character Faints Lack Sleep Adverse Consequences Losses Incurred Mods Impact Gameplay Experience Current Server Based Setup Time Sandrock Detracts Immersive Storytelling Experience Player Offline Progressing Quests Activities Challenging Accelerated Passage Game Time Time Constraint Induces Stress Fostering Relaxing Gameplay Environment Server Strict Modifying List H3 2 Time Progression Multiplayer Mode H3 List Notable Drawback Server Based Approach Multiplayer Worlds Active Player Time Relentlessly Marches Menu Mode Inventory Poses Challenge Players Meticulously Plan Min Max Activities Friends Offline Implement Private Account Based Multiplayer Allowing Players Host Servers Offer Solution Predicament Empower Players Play Game Terms Playing Wait Friends Online Counter Multiplayer Server Based Useless Wait Online List H3 3 Achievements Milestones Multiplayer H3 List Adding Achievements Multiplayer Mode Missed Opportunity Game Features Milestones Incorporating Track Personal Achievements Synchronizing Steam Achievements Enhance Multiplayer Experience Achievement Accessible Singleplayer Reason Play Singleplayer Mode Play Multiplayer Mode 500 Hours Complete 0 60 Achievements Cool List H3 4 Shared Storage Challenges Quest Completion H3 List Existing Shared Storage Offering Capacities 80 120 300 Levels 1 2 3 Introduces Challenges Mid Game Phases Challenge Accentuated Multiplayer Scenarios Multiple Players Contribute Shared Storage Shared Storage Reaches Capacity Compelled Resort Personal Storage Limiting Access Players Inconvenience Arises Players Hold Distinct Resources Offline Players Items Quests Farm Time Seamless Automatic Quest Item Retrieval Feature Single Player Mode Multiplayer Experience Introduces Additional Complexities Requiring Deliberate Coordination Players Ensure Efficient Quest Completion List H3 Final Note H3 Review Heavily Focused Multiplayer Mode Regrettably Vote Recommend Players Seeking Satisfying Multiplayer Experience Remain Hopeful Future Updates Address Concerns Revising Review Improvements Implemented,POSITIVE,1,0,35,4,0.8974358974358975
2023-11-09,"      as someone who has played their fair share of life simulation games, with the variety of animal crossing, stardew valley, and palia to be some of the main ones, this game comes very close to beating them all. i was thrilled to find out that this game was going to have multiplayer in it, seeing as my time at portia does not have multiplayer, which heavily influenced my choice to buy it or not.

      this game can be buggy at times and while i only have a 980 gpu, i can run this game at medium settings and it still looks pretty decent. i did not play the early access, only full release, and i can say that there seems to be quite a bit of content to this game. this game is very multifaceted with social/town, farming, combat, mining, building, animal, and pet aspects, with that just being what i have discovered with 19 hours of playing. i play with 2 other people and the game runs fairly well. i have only encountered a few lag/server sync issues between other players, a few ui glitch errors, and 1 wonky combat fight with an elite. but beyond those few things i haven't seen much to stop me from wanting to play this game as much as possible. 


[h3] pros [/h3]
- lots of content (19 hours in and it feels like i have so much more to do)
- decent price (i was gifted the game but seeing the price for how fun this game is seems fair)
- fun with friends
- multiplayer actual works
- leveling up feels important and good
- missions feel good and not like leg work (you can visually see the work you put into the town)
- tons of townspeople
- combat feels good and fun
- character customization (you can super customize your character with sliders)
- gear (weapons and clothes have stats that can help you with gathering and fighting)
- weather (the weather events in this game are really great. so far i have seen rain, sandstorm, and summer 
   heat. i am waiting to see snow in this game as of yet.)
- server stays up (no matter who owns the town, i am able to play on my friends server even after the 
   person who made it has left. this is a big game changer for me seeing as you don't have to stop playing on 
   one server because the host has left or crashed.)

[h3] cons [/h3]

- desync/stutter issues (i have only had this happen 2-3 times playing so far and it is fixed by a simple return 
  to lobby and rejoin.)
- ui machine icons disappear (i have only seen this once and it was fixed by rejoining the lobby)
- forced personal chests (i mention this because it was a pain to have only so much room in the one 
   community chest you get at the start of the game. you can upgrade it, but i would like to have the option 
   to share my personal chest contents if i choose to. and not have to run back to home every time someone 
   needed something.
- combat (could use a little work on hit registration and how your character can go through the enemies 
   while swinging your weapon)
- accidental playable character requests (in the game there is an option to talk to real people and play a 
   mini-game called critters. it feels a bit annoying at times when you are trying to interact with machines or 
   doors and other playable characters get the input over the item/machine/door. could be quite annoying if 
   playing with a lot of people in one area but not too bad overall.)

2023-11-15,"he's a 10, buuuuut.....

overall this is a pretty good game, and there's a lot of fun to be had in it. despite my negative review, i will keep playing it. and if you like games like stardew valley, you'll almost certainly like this one. the basic gameplay loop is fine - great even, if a little stale after awhile. and the story - likewise very enjoyable! the characters are, for the most part, unique and interesting and generally quite humorous. overall i should be able to recommend this game. so why don't i?

it's the little things. lots and lots of little things. for me, i play a game like this as a kind of escapism. i lose myself in the story and in getting to know the cast of characters - however cheesy it all might be. and in general, this game provides that better than most you might play, without the heaping dose of grim reality and tragedy you'll get from something like baldur's gate 3. it's a happy escapist fantasy. until you encounter (not bugs, because i did not encounter any that were not ultimately harmless and funny) some of the poorly or lazily implemented features.

obviously, you can date and marry and have kids with a good number of the characters. this is to be expected of this genre, and the process of getting to know these characters, through a variety of quests and events both focused on them and not, is quite a bit of fun. you will probably become quite invested in them. until you finish their content and they become hollow and uninteresting shells. they don't do or say anything new or interesting past a certain point - which is to be expected, but it is exacerbated by other things as i will point out. the dating/hangout mini game becomes a chore because after a couple of those you will have exhausted the dialogue with a given character - and that dialogue will not update even if you are actively in a relationship or married to the character. 

to make matters even worse, the story will not take any of this into account. whether or not you are dating a given character, or married to them even, will never come up outside of the one off wedding event or when talking to that character directly to get one of their canned lines of repetitive marriage dialogue - which are cute sure enough, but you can only hear them so many times before they lose all their charm. 

for a truly horrible example of how absurd this can get, at one point during the story you are to venture into a toxic environment full of extremely hostile enemies that want to kill you. all well and good, yea? well, if you are married to one of the characters involved, that character could be pregnant at the time of this quest. this does not come up...so your fun little happy escapism is irreparably ruined because the game is now sending your pregnant wife into a life and death situation because the smallest effort was not made to actually integrate the relationship and marriage system into the story in any way. 

and speaking of pregnancy, it's hilarious - from  a male character's perspective, i do not know how it differs if you play a female character and are the one to get pregnant. you will be teleported one morning to the hospital to see your spouse holding the baby, you will be prompted to name it, pick what the child will call you, and then you will be returned home. your spouse will be gone, already off following their preset schedule (which does not change even when you marry them by the way, they still follow the same routine as they do by default, except when it is interupted by the tasks you can choose to assign them). when you catch up to them...not a single damn mention of the baby they just pushed out. the entire system is barely implemented and it's kind of ridiculous. harvest moon 64 almost 30 years ago had a more robust and interesting system of marriage and children. what they've cobbled together here has the bones of something perfectly adequate, great even, but there is basically no connective tissue to bring it all together. 

overall, the game is quite good for what it is, and despite my negativity there is much to enjoy. but this is a life sim game, and the quite frankly pathetic implementation of some very important systems to the success of a game in that genre - dating, marriage, and children - leave a massive gaping hole in it. fixing these things would not even require a massive revamp of the game. just some basic time and care to make these choices feel as impactful as they should. lockout marriage until a point in the story where it cant create awkward situations, for example. implement new dialogues to accurately reflect relationship changes - despite all the voice acting a significant amount of the dialogue is unvoiced, so it is not even a question of needing to record new lines. just write more dialogue and shove it in there.",11594,Buuuuut Pretty Game Lot Fun Negative Review Playing Games Stardew Valley Basic Gameplay Loop Fine Stale Awhile Story Enjoyable Characters Unique Humorous Recommend Game Lots Lots Play Game Escapism Lose Story Cast Characters Cheesy Game Play Heaping Dose Grim Reality Tragedy Baldur Gate 3 Happy Escapist Fantasy Encounter Bugs Encounter Ultimately Harmless Funny Lazily Implemented Features Marry Kids Characters Expected Genre Process Characters Variety Quests Events Focused Bit Fun Invested Finish Content Hollow Uninteresting Shells Expected Exacerbated Dating Hangout Mini Game Chore Couple Exhausted Dialogue Character Dialogue Update Actively Relationship Married Character Matters Worse Story Account Dating Character Married Wedding Event Talking Character Canned Lines Repetitive Marriage Dialogue Cute Hear Times Lose Charm Horrible Absurd Story Venture Toxic Environment Extremely Hostile Enemies Kill Yea Married Characters Involved Character Pregnant Time Quest Fun Happy Escapism Irreparably Ruined Game Sending Pregnant Wife Life Death Situation Effort Integrate Relationship Marriage Story Speaking Pregnancy Hilarious Male Character Perspective Differs Play Female Character Pregnant Teleported Morning Hospital Spouse Holding Baby Prompted Pick Child Returned Spouse Preset Schedule Change Marry Follow Routine Default Interupted Tasks Choose Assign Catch Single Damn Mention Baby Pushed Entire Barely Implemented Ridiculous Harvest Moon 64 30 Robust Marriage Children Cobbled Bones Perfectly Adequate Basically Connective Tissue Bring Game Negativity Enjoy Life Sim Game Frankly Pathetic Implementation Systems Success Game Genre Dating Marriage Children Leave Massive Gaping Hole Fixing Require Massive Revamp Game Basic Time Care Choices Feel Impactful Lockout Marriage Story Create Awkward Situations Implement Dialogues Accurately Reflect Relationship Voice Acting Dialogue Unvoiced Question Record Lines Write Dialogue Shove,POSITIVE,1,0,42,1,0.9767441860465116
2023-11-15,"this is a hard one to judge. this game is a culmination of both what i love and hate about modern video games.

pros:
* the game loop isn't bad. it's similar to the predecessor and they didn't modify it much from there. 
* the characters in the game are pretty decent and distinct. some of them develop in unexpected ways which is neat.
* there ""larger than life"" events that do better than what its predecessor had.
* the conveniences later on are better than what was in its predecessor (with unfortunate caveats due to bugs).
* a cozy quality-of-life game.

cons:
* this game is buggy to a point i'm not sure how the hell it was released like it was. some of the bugs are similar to what i saw in early versions of its predecessor game which tells me they didn't learn much from their mistakes in implementation. i've made a list i can remember off the top of my head below.

* the combat is pretty weak. i didn't pay much attention to the early access but i was hoping they'd really make the combat more interesting. make no mistake that it's definitely better than what portia had. there's more variety here but it's literally ""smash the x button"" when you get down to it.

* after awhile, farming and mining stuff becomes repetitive which thankfully becomes easier. [strike]unfortunately, because the factory has such a fucked up implementation and literally doesn't work half the time, that convenience can be more irritating than helpful.[/strike] there's also no way to farm certain stuff or to get someone else to fetch it like agate. you have to go out and spend 5-10 minutes picking them 2 at a time. this isn't as big of a deal though, you don't generally need agate that often but for example, flourite you do since certain items that show up on commission require it to increase rarity. the only other way to get that is through ruin tokens which is already expensive and time consuming to obtain....

* some commissions are a trap. it might look easy but they want increased rarity on something like a steel bar which requires flourite to create which is an absolute pain in the ass to get. these commissions are never worth the gold they give (and they don't give much generally). they're there to make you feel miserable. the game should give double gold for such requests or triple gold for rare quality items.

all that said... i've already gotten over 100 hours out of it and i'll probably finish it. i'd wait for a sale but i'd be lying if i said i didn't enjoy it. there isn't really any challenge to it which kinda kills it a little bit. you can fail some stuff but you either have to try to fail it or fail it via a bug. 

bugs i saw while playing:
* literally first five minutes into the game, you'll notice that coco the bird fly's sideways and slow as if running into a wall. literally shows in one of the earliest cutscenes as you start playing.

* mobs and npcs end up your workshop seemingly lost, as if their pathing is telling them to go there for some reason and then they just literally run around doing nothing.

* soft locks are brimming in this game. they seem to be worse when you play the game for extended periods of time which brings me to...

* the game has some issues when played for long periods of time. things load slower or not at all, animations are wonkier, sound may not occur at all having you miss actually interesting voice lines.

* [strike]the factory you get later into the game is a broken mess. the ui doesn't update properly, parts of the ui doesn't work with controller for some reason, and multiple times now i've had the recycler ""production queue"" absolutely busted to where it was unusable. things that should produce more than one of a thing, for example bullets (5 each) or copper screws (2 each), will only produce one which is a clear bug since it shouldn't take fucking 20 steel bars and 50 gunpowder to make literally 10 rifle bullets, but doing the same thing directly on a forge would give you 50.[/strike] this was fixed in latest patch of this writing.

* npcs will fall to the bottom of the map, teleport endlessly, float in the sky or just out of reach, or not be able to interact with them at all until you leave the room or restart the game even.

* npc pathing will often put them smack dab in the middle of a cutscene where they mob pile to the point you can't see anything going on anymore.

* i've softlocked on a lot of scenes that want your character to automatically moved but apparently, i'm alone in this according to the forums.

* i've had the planting grid get stuck in 5x5 when in 4x4 mode, then plant incorrectly. this was with the robot: f machine. edit: there is a 5x5 mode later in the game but the robot isn't supposed to have it. 

* quests not triggering which would then fail after time passes.

* too many events scheduled at once. i had several quests on the same day as the day of memories, all at 1600.  they not only won't reschedule any of them, they also will cause bugs like not letting you join the ghost hunting event.

* probably more i'm not thinking of or too small of a bug to care.",11594,Hard Judge Game Culmination Love Hate Modern Video Games Pros Game Loop Bad Predecessor Modify Characters Game Pretty Decent Distinct Develop Unexpected Neat Larger Life Events Predecessor Conveniences Predecessor Unfortunate Caveats Bugs Cozy Quality Life Game Cons Game Buggy Released Bugs Versions Predecessor Game Tells Learn Mistakes Implementation List Remember Head Combat Pretty Weak Pay Attention Access Hoping Combat Mistake Portia Variety Literally Smash Button Awhile Farming Mining Stuff Repetitive Thankfully Easier Strike Factory Fucked Implementation Literally Time Convenience Irritating Helpful Strike Farm Stuff Fetch Agate Spend 5 Minutes Picking 2 Time Deal Agate Flourite Items Commission Require Increase Rarity Ruin Tokens Expensive Time Consuming Commissions Trap Easy Increased Rarity Steel Bar Requires Flourite Create Absolute Pain Ass Commissions Worth Gold Feel Miserable Game Double Gold Requests Triple Gold Rare Quality Items 100 Hours Finish Wait Sale Lying Enjoy Challenge Kinda Kills Bit Fail Stuff Fail Fail Bug Bugs Playing Literally Minutes Game Notice Coco Bird Fly Sideways Slow Running Wall Literally Earliest Cutscenes Start Playing Mobs Npcs Workshop Seemingly Lost Pathing Telling Reason Literally Soft Locks Brimming Game Worse Play Game Extended Periods Time Brings Game Issues Played Periods Time Load Slower Animations Wonkier Sound Occur Voice Lines Strike Factory Game Broken Mess Ui Update Properly Ui Controller Reason Multiple Times Recycler Production Queue Absolutely Busted Unusable Produce Bullets 5 Copper Screws 2 Produce Bug Fucking 20 Steel Bars 50 Gunpowder Literally Rifle Bullets Forge 50 Strike Fixed Patch Writing Npcs Fall Map Teleport Endlessly Float Sky Reach Interact Leave Restart Game Npc Pathing Smack Dab Middle Cutscene Mob Pile Softlocked Lot Scenes Character Automatically Moved Forums Planting Grid Stuck 5X5 4X4 Mode Plant Incorrectly Robot Machine Edit 5X5 Mode Game Robot Supposed Quests Triggering Fail Time Passes Events Scheduled Quests Day Day Memories 1600 Reschedule Bugs Letting Ghost Hunting Event Thinking Bug Care,POSITIVE,1,0,42,1,0.9767441860465116
2023-11-14,"if you love farming/building simulation games, you will most likely love this one. i have not even finished the game yet, but i wanted to post an honest and informative review while the game is at the height of attention. this is by far the #1 game in the genre for me. i normally do short and sweet reviews, but for a game like this i want to go over some of the important aspects of it that may make or break the players experience. so let me explain the good, the bad, and the ugly.

[b]the good[/b]:
-outstanding amount of content. you can see by my playtime that i have put in a significant amount of time. i have not even finished the main story yet, and i am not actually sure how close i am to the end. there is plenty of upgrades, levels, npc content, and building/farming to be done here

-you can have a farm with plants, chickens, buffalo, bunnies, and mounts

-there are about 20 or so romance-able npc's, all with their own character growth and story arcs along side the main story. some of them are very well done and interesting while others are not quite as fleshed out, but still enjoyable

-combat in the game is quick-paced hack-n-slash shoot-em-up style. there are ""dungeons"" to breeze through where you can get treasure, materials, and glory

-festivals are a lot of fun. you unlock more festivals as the game progresses and there are fun little mini games and unique events for each one of them.

-character creation is a bit similar to my time at portia and there are a lot of lore-friendly outfits and accessories you can use to personalize your builder. the hairstyles and coloring can be customized quite a bit to give you a unique look as well

-you can go on dates and hangout with the friends you meet in town, you can play mini games in an arcade and even mahjong at a later portion of the game.

-progression is slow but it feels great. every new house and machine upgrade you get feels like an achievement. you can upgrade your mounts, raise animals, have a huge farm, and it all feels earned. once you get more levels for your workshop and character and progress the main story you can automate collection of resources to help your progression quite a bit.

-the developers are awesome and are constantly replying to concerns and bug reports in the forums, as well as trying to improve the game.

[b]the bad[/b]:
-progression is slow. i know i stated this above, but people with not a lot of time on their hands may feel that they are not getting anywhere. a lot of this probably has a lot to do with how fast you decide to progress time. you can choose anywhere from 0.6x-3.0 time progression speed, and i believe that can have an impact on the pace of the game and how quickly it goes by. i like to take things slow and experience everything the game has to offer, so i have it set at 0.6.

-stamina and time can be hard to manage at first. you may feel a struggle early game trying to get the resources you need and finishing missions on time. this caveat goes away after getting some levels and experience under your belt. a lot of people feel a struggle at the beginning. taking the game slow is a good idea at the beginning until you get used to it.

-certain resources are very hard to get such as electronics, certain plants, trees, or animal resources. some of this stuff you need for progression but it is hard or impossible to automate in any way at the beginning. when you do commissions/missions for townsfolk, if you are not careful then you won't be able to complete them on time. this is why it is good to take it slow at the beginning and learn the ins-and-outs. this adds to early game struggle and gives a sense of not getting anywhere.

-some of the romance-able npc's don't really have much character development or story missions, decreasing their interesting aspect.

-the house building/decorating leaves much to be desired. it is difficult to place objects or know what objects to place in certain circumstances. the building ui is clunky and not user friendly. it can be struggle to get a look that you like. there are mismatched patterns or just plain ugly ones when making roofs or rooms. they honestly should have hired a color expert or interior decorator because some combinations of design can be atrocious. this part of the game is passable and you can get something that you are satisfied with, but it could take some workaround.

-workshop upgrades are incredibly expensive, to the point where you have to grind money for a long time to get room for all of the workshop add-ons, machines, and other goodies. it took me a good month of in game time to get an upgrade that would give me enough building space to extend my house because of how much money it was to get it. this part of the game feels a bit unbalanced, especially with how much money you will be spending elsewhere.

[b]the ugly[/b]
-this game is bethesda level buggy as of right now. i am not even remotely exaggerating. there are issues with npc's disappearing out of nowhere, floating mounts that you can't ride because they are stuck in the air, a visual bug that messes with some resource contracts, unclear missions markers or explanations etc.

-some missions have a timer on them. so you need to complete it in a certain number of days. there are several missions that you will fail for no reason at all with no in-game timer attached to them. these missions show no sign and give no hint of a fail-trigger, but if you don't do them then you will fail them at some point for what seems like no reason. i have had this happen a few times. this is usually with side missions. 

-you need to save a lot. there are some potentially game breaking bugs and missions you can screw up through no fault of your own, as stated above. it is a good idea to have several hard saves just in case something undesirable happens that messes up your progress with missions, npc's, or other aspects.

-the game does not run well sometimes. i get around ~60 fps pretty consistently, but certain areas, scenes, or events can cause huge framerate drops to as low as 15 fps, and i have had the game crash on me once. some people report even worse performance, but for me it is tolerable. i have a pretty decent gaming computer. i can run cyberpunk on max with a constant 60-70 fps, and this game performs slightly worse in certain cases. i will say that it seems they have ironed out some of this in the last week or so since my performance seems to have improved over the last couple days. in particular, when the train comes into town is one of the points where i get an fps drop to 15, but earlier today it did not drop when the train came in.

the game is by no means perfect, but it is my favorite game in the genre. if you liked portia or games like stardew valley, coral island, or any other popular sim games like this, then you will probably love this one. the developers are constantly looking at feedback and improving the game, so i am almost positive all of the negatives i pointed out will be fixed at some point in the future. they have already been actively releasing post-launch updates and they even intend to add more content eventually from what i have read. the developers and this game have my full confidence and support!

2023-11-14,"let's just get the important bit out of the way first: this is my 2023 game of the year. it was only a matter of when the game would come out of early access to claim its crown. since this game hit on nov. 2, i nominated it for the steam award.

now then, on to why this game is, as of this writing, my 6th most-played title in terms of hours on my steam account.

it's basically everything from my time at portia, but improved upon and made better in every possible way. the world is bigger, the building mechanics refined to a visible-from-space shine, the action rpg story fleshed out in a way that makes it the primary driver of gameplay rather than purely a framing device.

indeed, this is less a cozy game with action-rpg elements and more a reimagining of the action rpg formula where cozy game mechanics are the primary driver of progression. the genres blend seamlessly in a way that they never have before—looking at you, horizon zero dawn and forbidden west and every ubisoft game, where the crafting is tedious and feels unnecessary.

but at the same time, this game also has a cozy soul. if you're played any harvest moon-like, the life sim elements are exactly what you want them to be and then some. building relationships with villagers, romance, family life, it's all there with plenty of choices and some remarkably well-written relationship and character backstory dialogue. there are just so many ways to get a villager's friendship up compared to, say, stardew valley's more traditional talk-and-gift approach, and with the anti-frustration feature of not having to talk to every villager every day just to keep their relationship level from backsliding.

speaking of anti-frustration features, there are plenty more in this game as well. none of the main story quests are timed; complete them at your leisure. get overleveled if the combat's not your strong suit. rush the main story quests to unlock more of the crafting recipes if that's your jam. speedrunners and challenge runners? go to town, the game's got plenty of measurable ways to keep score. 

almost none of the sidequests are timed. if you unlock them too fast, as happens when you're powering through the main quest and hitting every character's sidequest trigger faster than you can bang them out, well, take a step back and take your time. the devs listened to players during the early access stage of the process and took the most common frustration—players felt rushed—out of the game. you want to complete them as fast as possible, nothing's stopping you. but it all fits in with the overarching theme of well-camouflaged accessibility that never feels like it's being dumbed down.

as for the action and combat in the action rpg, well, the devs know they're not from software. this isn't going to challenge anyone with a firm grounding in action games. you can overpower just about anything in the game because the devs have consciously avoided the bethesda syndrome of level-scaling enemies. well, with one exception—going too far afield in a sandstorm is going to surprise you the first time you run into high-level versions of basic enemies—but even that is a smart stylistic choice that makes sandstorms feel appropriately dangerous and threatening for a game set against the backdrop of a desert environment with a strong ""green aesop"" running through the main story.

is the game perfect? well, no, no game is perfect, not even games that are otherwise among the greatest of all time (i say this as someone who loved everything about red dead redemption 2 except for the on-rails quest design, for example.)

for one thing, the fishing minigame is one of the weakest i've seen in this genre. it's simplistic and repetitive and offers almost no challenge and very little reason to even engage with it beyond a couple of cooking recipes. this is a shame, especially since portia's fishing minigame was quite fun and other games like stardew, animal crossing (and dinkum, which cribs heavily from it), and even red dead 2 have great outdoorsman-style fishing gameplay.

in addition, there are a couple of dungeons in the midgame that have a jarring tonal shift toward platformer gameplay. thankfully the devs refined it a bit after its initial introduction; jumps are more forgiving, there's plenty of ""coyote time"" with ledges, and there's the option to skip the trickiest segments if you fail them enough times, but for a game that otherwise has good dungeon design, there's a heavy ""why, devs?"" when playing the two dungeons in question.

but those are minor quibbles in a game that is otherwise the absolute apex of the cozy game genre with one heck of a story rpg to go with it.

absolutely, by miles, my 2023 game of the year. 10/10.",12878,Bit 2023 Game Matter Game Access Claim Crown Game Hit Nov 2 Nominated Steam Award Game Writing 6Th Played Title Terms Hours Steam Account Basically Time Portia Improved Bigger Building Mechanics Refined Visible Space Shine Action Rpg Story Fleshed Primary Driver Gameplay Purely Framing Device Cozy Game Action Rpg Elements Reimagining Action Rpg Formula Cozy Game Mechanics Primary Driver Progression Genres Blend Seamlessly Horizon Dawn Forbidden West Ubisoft Game Crafting Tedious Feels Unnecessary Time Game Cozy Soul Played Harvest Moon Life Sim Elements Building Relationships Villagers Romance Family Life Plenty Choices Remarkably Written Relationship Character Backstory Dialogue Villager Friendship Compared Stardew Valley Traditional Talk Gift Approach Anti Frustration Feature Talk Villager Day Relationship Level Backsliding Speaking Anti Frustration Features Plenty Game Main Story Quests Timed Complete Leisure Overleveled Combat Strong Suit Rush Main Story Quests Unlock Crafting Recipes Jam Speedrunners Challenge Runners Town Game Plenty Measurable Score Sidequests Timed Unlock Fast Powering Main Quest Hitting Character Sidequest Trigger Faster Bang Step Time Devs Listened Players Access Stage Process Common Frustration Players Rushed Game Complete Fast Stopping Fits Overarching Theme Camouflaged Accessibility Feels Dumbed Action Combat Action Rpg Devs Software Challenge Firm Grounding Action Games Overpower Game Devs Consciously Avoided Bethesda Syndrome Level Scaling Enemies Exception Afield Sandstorm Surprise Time Level Versions Basic Enemies Smart Stylistic Choice Sandstorms Feel Appropriately Dangerous Threatening Game Set Backdrop Desert Environment Strong Green Aesop Running Main Story Game Perfect Game Perfect Games Time Loved Red Dead Redemption 2 Rails Quest Design Fishing Minigame Weakest Genre Simplistic Repetitive Offers Challenge Reason Engage Couple Cooking Recipes Shame Portia Fishing Minigame Fun Games Stardew Animal Crossing Dinkum Cribs Heavily Red Dead 2 Outdoorsman Style Fishing Gameplay Addition Couple Dungeons Midgame Jarring Tonal Shift Platformer Gameplay Thankfully Devs Refined Bit Initial Introduction Jumps Forgiving Plenty Coyote Time Ledges Option Skip Trickiest Segments Fail Times Game Dungeon Design Heavy Devs Playing Dungeons Question Minor Quibbles Game Absolute Apex Cozy Game Genre Heck Story Rpg Absolutely Miles 2023 Game,POSITIVE,1,0,49,3,0.9423076923076923
2023-11-14,"pretty full synopsis, no spoilers... except for the stupid actor part... which doesn't really spoil anything... it's the equivalent of saying, ""guy walks outside"" oh my gosh... he really did walk outside! spoilersss. i'm confident it wouldn't be the thing that kept me out of heaven by saying no spoilers...

if you liked my time at portia, you'll like this one. the controls are  basically the same with some minor differences that take getting used to. key difference i find amazing is that your storage is linked to your inventory when building, as well as most cases when giving gifts or completing quests. i found one instance where i couldn't give something in my storage and it's probably a bug. if a developer ever reads this, it was when one of the npc's was craving a ""copper plate"" i had to have it physically on me to give in that case... or maybe i'm dumb and haven't realized that all gifts must be in inventory to give and that's just a feature. in other words you don't need to spend hours organizing your storage... just throw it in and call it a day (except for clothes you want to keep... that's worth putting in it's own storage... everything else? who cares?)

relic hunting... is more exciting... maybe some won't like the change but i especially love it. instead of a giant cube room it's multiple floors of some building or something, and there are specific items you can get per floor. it makes it less of a ""find one of 50 relics which each have 2-7 pieces in this one giant room! didn't find them? well then do it all over again!"" now it's more like 5 relics per floor in a designed building that has multiple floors and start from whichever floor you want so long as you've gone deep enough to find the entrance to that floor. huge improvement in my book.

combat... i can't say about all the weapons... i started with the daggers tried, the others once, i love the daggers.... call me thorfin. 

combat is pretty similar to the old game, but just better. from armor breaking/staggering, to varying stats on the same item because of it's quality, which can range from low, to perfect, and then there's rare, which adds some cool features.... whether it's crafting, buying or finding. the items are all much more exciting in this game.

i was disappointed.... that everything feels mostly the same as the original game, but happy it's better. you're basically getting the same game but part two. 

the dialogue is mostly skipable, with the occasional choose your response, in which cases i regret not reading the dialogue... buuuut 95% of the time... totally skipable. unless i'm in a reading mood, i find it average, and occasionally good.

cut scenes.... are extremely lacking... it's like a low quality first time actor playing a major roll in a lead film, and the director says after each scene, ""cut.. that's a wrap... send it to production."" when they should've said, ""cut! that sucks! what are you doing! you're entering a scene where all the monsters are already gone, you've just barely shown up, and then you do a front roll into the room... from the middle of the room... you then aim your pistol, stand up, smile doing a finger spin with the pistol... catch it, blow the smoke off the tip of the pistol, when there is no smoke, because you haven't fired a single shot?... are you stupid? did you take acting lessons from stupid school? did you graduate top of your stupid class with stupid honors? because that was pretty stupid!""

now if they added a character to come in and say those exact words to that silly dude who did all those things... then it would've been hilarious, and we all would've understood... that's the stupid guy... but no, every cut scene is pretty much like that.

i love the game... plenty to make fun of, and critique, but that doesn't stop me from loving it. leave a comment/question if you have any specific inquiries.

dlc worth it?..... you aren't missing anything by not buying any of the dlc items... sure they'll give you a nice head start, but even though i had them i found myself not using any of them because i like starting a game with nothing and then building up to something awesome. if you're the same, save yourself a few bucks, otherwise if you just want some gear for some different looks, then maybe you'll like it.

character creation.... well at least you won't look like you have down syndrome in the game... unless that's what you're going for i'm sure you can pull it off!!! there is a major improvement on the quality of character in the creation tab... but i just want more!!! 

you really don't have a lot of options, and they don't leave you thinking, ""that character i made looks so bad a!!!"" it's more of a, ""well... i guess that's as good as it gets."" i liked how mine turned out, but it took 3 hours of messing around with every possibility, starting and deleting 3 games (the character never looks exactly the same in the game play)...before i finally got to ""my guy looks really kind of okay!""

(example... i put lipstic and changed the coloring on my guy to make him look like he had actual lips... not feminine lips... just dude lips... i get into the game... feminine af! deleted, and then did the same thing except made the lipstick lighter than what looked good... in the gameplay it looked pretty good. i mean.....i'm the equivalent of brad freaking pitt in this character creation screen! i look so good! kindof... joking aside i was happy with the final result. i can't say whether it's the same for making a girl since i didn't try.)

[h3] okay, so i have obviously played this game a lot, and it's because it is that good! if you're a return player from portia, i can confirm to you that sandrock is a massive upgrade in almost all aspects! if you have never played a game in the my time at series, don't worry! you absolutely do not have to play portia to enjoy sandrock! after over 200 hours of game play, here's my major takeaways ~ [/h3]

[u] the great ~ [/u] 

[b] the story line [/b]
- sandrock has a really great main story quest line, with enough twist and turns to keep you interested and immersed. it truly was a pleasure to play through it! there's a good mix of resource gathering, social aspects, combat, farming, and advancement required that keeps you motivated to continue grinding towards completion. also, if you're a return player from portia, i personally believe that sandrock has a better story line, and has increased difficulty.
[b] the characters [/b]
- wow! sandrock truly has some very colorful characters! without giving anything away, these side characters have a variety of personalities that are genuinely fun to interact with. in a lot of other games from this genre i tend to stop talking to a lot of the npcs around town, but i actually like hearing what the characters in sandrock have to say! it also helps that every character is given new unique dialogue after progress in the story is made, so they're not just constantly spouting the same lines all the time, regardless of development. there's a lot of great romance options as well, with there being someone for everyone. 
[b] the dialogue [/b]
- there's no other way to say this ~ this game just has straight up hilarious lines! from a farmer who's a part-time conspiracy theorist to a rock obsessed wannabe deputy, there's no shortage of great lines from the characters around the game. the dialogue also makes you want to befriend more of the citizens to see their extra events because of how hilarious they can be. your player character can even give some golden one-liners as the game progresses! 
[b] the grind [/b] 
- you really have to get involved in all aspects of the game when playing. you're going to need a lot of wood to complete projects, i mean, you are a builder. however, sandrock is desolate and cutting down trees and cacti is a big no-no. this means you have to cut down tiny bushes, dead logs, etc. which do not give you a lot of resources, meaning you've got to keep at the grind! also, as you unlock more areas and more of the story, you find yourself having to go back to previous ruins/areas in order to get different types of materials, as they're not in the same place. don't forget that water powers all of your machines, so you have to keep your tank full in the middle of the desert! 

[u] the lacking~ [/u]

[b] the family issue [/b]
- in short, because there's so many elements in sandrock, they eventually fizzle out in unsatisfactory ways. a good example can be seen with married and family life, which is just not fleshed out enough. considering characters around the game continuously sing praises towards your character, and comment on the various things going on around, it's strange that basically nobody acknowledges your spouse and children. so far, there's no family events, and once your children exit the baby stage, you literally never see them interact with anyone, including your spouse. they wake up and essentially go to one place (the train station) for the entire day.  it would've been nice to have them as actual members of the town, with their own events as they age, and a routine that mimics other npcs. as for your spouse, the married events currently in game are very boring and out of place for some characters. i would really love to see married life and family life be more fleshed out in the future, whether in another my time game, or in an expansion/update! i would rather have less romance options and just one child if that means that the additional content that comes with them would be stronger. 
[b] character favoritism + strange depth [/b]
- it's very obvious that, because of fan reception, some characters are more favored than others. by this i mean that they have way more content. take fang and logan as an example. both characters are fan favorites, and they have some really cool events! these events also work really well with what has been presented with their characters, which gives not only their characters, but the game, more depth. it really makes you believe that they had a life before you, and have a life despite you. i suppose this makes me more critical of the other characters in the game. director qi is a good example of this. you actually get to know so much about his character! for example, he's the grandson of a successful scientist who appears to be very strict, his parent's had more ""lowly"" jobs in comparison and qi appears to sort of look down on them, and he even states that his parents were shocked to find out that you exist (if you romance him), and that when he was younger he calculated that there was only a 3.14% chance of him finding love. these all combine to create such an interesting character, and gives you a plethora of ideas of how his character will/can progress. however, despite these tidbits that you can gather, that's basically it. his character, as well as a large portion of characters in the game, plateau. this is what i mean about strange depth, it's like they had more planned for certain characters, and it just never came to fruition. i was so certain when romancing qi's character that there was going to be some really cool events regarding his past, him falling in love with you, having children of his own, etc., and it just never happened. it honestly was a big disappointment because i saw all the makings of a great side story for a lot of the romance-able characters, but it's just not there. 

[h3] in conclusion, i honestly feel like i have so much more to say, which isn't surprising considering how much i loved the game. additionally, i would say that because i love the game and series so much i am probably more critical of it in certain ways! i think that's truly the hallmark sign of a great game, liking it so much that you want to make certain changes to perfect it! all in all, sandrock was truly an amazing experience and i would recommend it to all lovers of the genre. however, keep in mind that there are going to be aspects of the game that will leave you frustrated. these frustrations, at least for me, have a lot to do with the fact that i just want more! keep it up devs! you're doing great sweeties, and the improvement from portia is massive!

2023-11-11,"overall, i recommend the game - 480 hours played across early release - but that doesn't mean the game is perfect. much has been made of the voiceover issues with this game, so i'll bypass those, other than to add that changing the voiceover artist for later updates compounded the issue.

it's less clunky (although arguable less realistic, as a consequence) than its predecessor, my time at portia, which may make for a less than satisfying experience for anyone who chooses to play that game after this one. the characters in sandrock are less bobble-headed, too, which is an improvement. portia and sandrock happen in a simultaneous timelime, which leads to some quietly-amusing references to, effectively, your portia character at points during sandrock, another reason to consider playing portia first.

of the five bachelors i romanced, three of them exhibited behaviour that, in real life, should set major alarm bells ringing, which is quite concerning. a couple of the npcs are genuinely unlikeable, which is fine and reflective of real life; but i found myself resenting completing lucrative contracts for one of them by late game, as their relationship with me continued to increase even as my loathing of them grew.

as i did play this through early release, some things may have changed by full release, but a few niggly annoyances stood out: at times, lucrative commissions for machinery would appear on the commission board; but without having any in-game ability to know what was required to complete construction, it was quite frustrating to accept these commissions, research the manufacturing plans, discover you needed more advanced equipment yourself, research that, then find that you needed components you either didn't have materials for, or didn't have the ability to make. in one instance, the 'base' instructions for making the refined material i needed to make one component didn't even become available until nearly two months after i'd failed the commission. if the capacity to complete the commission doesn't exist, don't make it available.

secondly, there were times when it became impossible to complete tasks because the final act clashed with some other event. some of these may have since been resolved. in a related annoyance, there are times when the pc wakes up with awareness of events it is literally impossible for them to have any knowledge of. often this is minor: calendar events added on rising in the morning that are explained when mail is read. occasionally, however, these are quite significant. just as bed, there are some events involving npcs that clearly acknowledge the passage of a significant period of time (a minimum two weeks would be essential in one case), yet those events conclude within a day or so. then there is the issue of being 'transported' to major events when you get up. on one occasion, running back home after such an event, i encountered a minor task simply by talking with an npc that i had no means of answering because the task was outlined in a letter i hadn't yet had a chance to read. more concerningly, the non-committal answer i gave may have broken the character, who never moved from the spot i encountered him for the remainder of the game, unless needed elsewhere.

the nanny-nag that says ""you can't use that possibly rude word!"" when naming things in single-player is both ludicrous and offensive: i'm an adult, not six years old, and i can make my own decisions. if it's important that any vaguely-implied rudeness must be leapt on with extreme prejudice, then i would suggest that eliminating toxic behaviours from a multitude of npcs would be a better use of censorship - especially if (and i am forced to assume that this must be the case) the game makers are trying to avoid corrupting sweet childish innocence.

similarly, an in-game swimwear fashion show basically designed to sell dlcs is both sexist and cowardly in dressing the female models in bikins and the males in shorts. the game designers may have jumped on the 'it's okay to be gay"" bandwagon; but their moral code is severely lacking in other areas (most particularly regarding toxic behaviours).

one in-game shop has a link to actual character figurines on amazon: if you follow the link you find that you're being asked to pay an offensively-large amount of money for a blind-box figurine, so that's a definitive 'no' on both counts. still, that annoyance is easily-avoided, although it does make me less-inclined to consider buying other pathea games products, up to and including dlcs, so they may like to rethink their approach.

yes, i have concentrated on the negatives in this review. on the positive side, the game is immensely-playable. for an obsessive such as me, there is always something to do, with the essential wait-times scattered throughout the game usually not too much of a trial. some npcs are clearly on the autism spectrum, and this is treated respectfully (albeit occasionally with not-unreasonable impatience) by other npcs and player choices, which is to be commended. apart from some built-in sexism, the character design is generally appealing, and the capacity to 'hide the hat' via the settings is appreciated: having put a lot of effort into designing my character, i like being able to see them. the storylines are often engaging, although i wish the character-based relationship-building tasks had a time expiry if unselected, because having them sit constantly on the map when i have no interest in following them through is annoying.

in summary, an enjoyable, very playable game with a number of flaws, some of them significant.",18231,Recommend Game 480 Hours Played Release Game Perfect Voiceover Issues Game Bypass Add Changing Voiceover Artist Updates Compounded Issue Clunky Arguable Realistic Consequence Predecessor Time Portia Satisfying Experience Chooses Play Game Characters Sandrock Bobble Headed Improvement Portia Sandrock Happen Simultaneous Timelime Leads Quietly Amusing References Effectively Portia Character Sandrock Reason Playing Portia Bachelors Romanced Exhibited Behaviour Real Life Set Major Alarm Bells Ringing Couple Npcs Genuinely Unlikeable Fine Reflective Real Life Resenting Completing Lucrative Contracts Late Game Relationship Continued Increase Loathing Grew Play Release Changed Release Niggly Annoyances Stood Times Lucrative Commissions Machinery Commission Board Game Ability Required Complete Construction Frustrating Accept Commissions Manufacturing Plans Discover Advanced Equipment Components Materials Ability Instance Base Instructions Refined Material Component Months Failed Commission Capacity Complete Commission Exist Times Impossible Complete Tasks Final Clashed Event Resolved Annoyance Times Pc Wakes Awareness Events Literally Impossible Knowledge Minor Calendar Events Rising Morning Explained Mail Read Occasionally Bed Events Involving Npcs Acknowledge Passage Period Time Minimum Weeks Essential Events Conclude Day Issue Transported Major Events Occasion Running Event Encountered Minor Task Simply Talking Npc Answering Task Outlined Letter Chance Read Concerningly Committal Answer Broken Character Moved Spot Encountered Remainder Game Nanny Nag Rude Word Naming Single Player Ludicrous Offensive Adult Decisions Vaguely Implied Rudeness Leapt Extreme Prejudice Eliminating Toxic Behaviours Multitude Npcs Censorship Forced Assume Game Makers Avoid Corrupting Sweet Childish Innocence Game Swimwear Fashion Basically Designed Sell Dlcs Sexist Cowardly Dressing Female Models Bikins Males Shorts Game Designers Jumped Gay Bandwagon Moral Code Severely Lacking Toxic Behaviours Game Shop Link Actual Character Figurines Amazon Follow Link Pay Offensively Money Blind Box Figurine Definitive Counts Annoyance Easily Avoided Inclined Buying Pathea Games Products Including Dlcs Rethink Approach Concentrated Negatives Review Positive Game Immensely Playable Obsessive Essential Wait Times Scattered Game Trial Npcs Autism Spectrum Treated Respectfully Albeit Occasionally Unreasonable Impatience Npcs Player Choices Commended Built Sexism Character Design Appealing Capacity Hide Hat Settings Appreciated Lot Effort Designing Character Storylines Engaging Character Based Relationship Building Tasks Time Expiry Unselected Sit Constantly Map Annoying Summary Enjoyable Playable Game Flaws,POSITIVE,1,0,53,15,0.7794117647058824

2023-11-11,"having played portia, and having played this a bit while in ea, i can definitively say that this is a straight upgrade in many ways compared to the previous game and that time spent in ea was well spent to make a generally well-polished experience on release. 

the thing that stood out to me as vastly improved in comparison to portia is the combat, which, for a game that has utilized this mechanic in a more intimate way that other farming/building/life simulation games, i think really nails the good balance in necessity to being enjoyable to engage with. especially when you start upgrading the combat skills, getting more combos, getting the flow of the enemy actions and dodging and timing strikes, while not particularly profound, still feels enjoyable and far more engaging than the previous games and others in the same genre i've experienced. it feels simple enough though that even if you're not really playing this game to partake in the combat-portion of the game, it's easy enough to out-level the enemies by performing other tasks that simple button mashing to get the mats you need from lower level monsters won't pose much of an obstacle.

outside of combat, i've always enjoyed the commission system in both games, and i think it serves well here for giving yourself a sense of progression and direction. while being rewarding enough that, while being somewhat repetitive in what you'll be building for the various residents of sandrock, serves more as the foundation for pursuing other enjoyable ventures like upgrading your workshop, buying mats that you need either directly at stores or commissioning deliveries while giving you enough of a reward in not only the money you need, but additional materials and easy relationship improvements outside of the, arguably, rather shallow and repetitive npc conversational engagements quickly enough to give you variety in other things to do without feeling like too much of a grind.

the story is also rather cute, if not a bit on the simple side, which imo, is fine for what it is - it gives you a further sense of purpose and a meaningful way to progress unlockable areas, residents, and mechanics. i feel several of the npcs have notable quirks that make them memorable enough to want to engage with them and their missions, although at times, even with the characters that are not designed to be long-winded (like cooper), i found myself wanting to read the dialog faster than i wanted to hear it from them because there's just something about the way they talk and the flow that just made me frequently want to skip it. can't really put my finger on why exactly, but this was especially true when interacting with them daily during the regular chat interactions. with that said though, one really nice touch is how npcs all have their own individual reactions to story events that are enjoyable to listen to, even if they can be a bit long-winded sometimes. it's a nice touch to detail that somewhat makes your accomplishments in the game feel more relevant to your place in the world.

lastly, while i haven't played much of it since ea, the multiplayer seems way more polished (and was non-existent in the previous game) and has been pretty fun so far. if you've got friends to play with, while it's completely separate from the base instance of the game, the co-op workspace and co-op commissions and being able to engage in spelunking and combat with friends gives it a fresh feel from the base, single-player, portion of the game.

[h3][u]tl:dr[/u][/h3]
- solid improvement from the previous game in almost every way.
- combat improvements especially feel much better from previous games.
- story is fine, albeit a bit on the simple side. more focus made on the mechanics.
- many npcs are memorable in their own way if not a bit long-winded and the base chat mechanic is a bit bleh but the ""play"" mechanics make up for it a bit (albeit, get a bit repetitive with the limited options and expensive energy costs to engage in them). 
- multiplayer is a separate instance from the base, single-player, game, but having all the same mechanics being applied while playing with friends has, so far, been a very enjoyable experience and is way more polished than when it was introduced in ea.",18231,Played Portia Played Bit Ea Definitively Straight Upgrade Compared Previous Game Time Spent Ea Spent Polished Experience Release Stood Vastly Improved Comparison Portia Combat Game Utilized Mechanic Intimate Farming Building Life Simulation Games Nails Balance Necessity Enjoyable Engage Start Upgrading Combat Skills Combos Flow Enemy Actions Dodging Timing Strikes Profound Feels Enjoyable Engaging Previous Games Genre Experienced Feels Simple Playing Game Partake Combat Portion Game Easy Level Enemies Performing Tasks Simple Button Mashing Mats Level Monsters Pose Obstacle Combat Enjoyed Commission Games Serves Sense Progression Direction Rewarding Repetitive Building Residents Sandrock Serves Foundation Pursuing Enjoyable Ventures Upgrading Workshop Buying Mats Stores Commissioning Deliveries Reward Money Additional Materials Easy Relationship Improvements Arguably Shallow Repetitive Npc Conversational Engagements Variety Feeling Grind Story Cute Bit Simple Imo Fine Sense Purpose Meaningful Progress Unlockable Residents Mechanics Feel Npcs Notable Quirks Memorable Engage Missions Times Characters Designed Winded Cooper Read Dialog Faster Hear Talk Flow Frequently Skip Finger True Interacting Daily Regular Chat Interactions Nice Touch Npcs Individual Reactions Story Events Enjoyable Listen Bit Winded Nice Touch Accomplishments Game Feel Relevant Lastly Played Ea Multiplayer Polished Existent Previous Game Pretty Fun Friends Play Completely Separate Base Instance Game Op Workspace Op Commissions Engage Spelunking Combat Friends Fresh Feel Base Single Player Portion Game H3 Tl Dr H3 Solid Improvement Previous Game Combat Improvements Feel Previous Games Story Fine Albeit Bit Simple Focus Mechanics Npcs Memorable Bit Winded Base Chat Mechanic Bit Bleh Play Mechanics Bit Albeit Bit Repetitive Limited Options Expensive Energy Costs Engage Multiplayer Separate Instance Base Single Player Game Mechanics Applied Playing Friends Enjoyable Experience Polished Introduced Ea,POSITIVE,1,0,53,15,0.7794117647058824

2023-11-09,"      as someone who has played their fair share of life simulation games, with the variety of animal crossing, stardew valley, and palia to be some of the main ones, this game comes very close to beating them all. i was thrilled to find out that this game was going to have multiplayer in it, seeing as my time at portia does not have multiplayer, which heavily influenced my choice to buy it or not.

      this game can be buggy at times and while i only have a 980 gpu, i can run this game at medium settings and it still looks pretty decent. i did not play the early access, only full release, and i can say that there seems to be quite a bit of content to this game. this game is very multifaceted with social/town, farming, combat, mining, building, animal, and pet aspects, with that just being what i have discovered with 19 hours of playing. i play with 2 other people and the game runs fairly well. i have only encountered a few lag/server sync issues between other players, a few ui glitch errors, and 1 wonky combat fight with an elite. but beyond those few things i haven't seen much to stop me from wanting to play this game as much as possible. 


[h3] pros [/h3]
- lots of content (19 hours in and it feels like i have so much more to do)
- decent price (i was gifted the game but seeing the price for how fun this game is seems fair)
- fun with friends
- multiplayer actual works
- leveling up feels important and good
- missions feel good and not like leg work (you can visually see the work you put into the town)
- tons of townspeople
- combat feels good and fun
- character customization (you can super customize your character with sliders)
- gear (weapons and clothes have stats that can help you with gathering and fighting)
- weather (the weather events in this game are really great. so far i have seen rain, sandstorm, and summer 
   heat. i am waiting to see snow in this game as of yet.)
- server stays up (no matter who owns the town, i am able to play on my friends server even after the 
   person who made it has left. this is a big game changer for me seeing as you don't have to stop playing on 
   one server because the host has left or crashed.)

[h3] cons [/h3]

- desync/stutter issues (i have only had this happen 2-3 times playing so far and it is fixed by a simple return 
  to lobby and rejoin.)
- ui machine icons disappear (i have only seen this once and it was fixed by rejoining the lobby)
- forced personal chests (i mention this because it was a pain to have only so much room in the one 
   community chest you get at the start of the game. you can upgrade it, but i would like to have the option 
   to share my personal chest contents if i choose to. and not have to run back to home every time someone 
   needed something.
- combat (could use a little work on hit registration and how your character can go through the enemies 
   while swinging your weapon)
- accidental playable character requests (in the game there is an option to talk to real people and play a 
   mini-game called critters. it feels a bit annoying at times when you are trying to interact with machines or 
   doors and other playable characters get the input over the item/machine/door. could be quite annoying if 
   playing with a lot of people in one area but not too bad overall.)

2023-11-09,"i liked ""my time at portia"" in spite of what it needed still in terms of polish. it was an ambitious game with many of the things it tried felt mostly half baked and not fully flushed out.

i can happily say that ""my time at sandrock"" not only meets the levels set up by it's predecessor, but also far exceeds them. 

first, the game proudly sticks with it's theme. every aspect of this is themed around you being in a desert, from basic crafting to even fishing. on a side note, this is easily the better fishing mini games i've played, but i wont spoil how that works.

second, the story is very engaging. ~50ish hours in, i'm very immersed in the setting and very motivated to keep going. the characters all seem to have their own motivations and there's a plethora of areas where their quests have pay off, both big and small. the small, being a mark of true craftsmanship.

third, the relationship mechanics are fantastic. they don't expand the bare bones from the previous game (if it ain't broke don't fix it) but there's more to do around sandrock than portia. i do have a favorite addition though [spoiler] you literally hold hands with your partner when you're out on a date, they'll keep up with you as you run. this is the cutest damn thing in the world. bless whomever pushed that to get in because it was worth it.[/spoiler] 

if you've played the sequel, than this should be a no brainer. if you've not played the series, if not, i'd probably recommend going with the previous game first, but don't let that stop you if you're eager to start. there's nothing in portia that's critical for sandrock to be enjoyable.

post completion update: 
i still mostly stick by what i said, albeit with a few things to call out. first, the dlc is already in the game, but they want you to pay to unlock it. it's also not fun to get an in-game ad for it, basically. dragon age did the same and i hated it then, and i hate it now.

second, there's didn't seem to be any reaction to the person i ended up marrying (ellie, in my case). cooper seems like he'd be all about spending time with his grand kids.

and the ending [spoiler] a little abrupt. it wasn't bad, but i'd prefer to end on a higher note.

2023-11-08,"if you liked my time in portia, then this is more of that, polished and with new features. it's a cute crafting game with combat, some building, many characters and story.

the gameplay in the beginning can feel restricted and slow, and you have to rush to meet your daily goals. this does of course become easier and can be tweaked with game settings and mods if you want.

the story is overall lighthearted and often silly, but does have some underlying messages and darker tones.

2023-11-05,"i absolutely love this game. previously my favourite farming game was portia, now it's sandrock. it's such an amazing game that its existence makes me happy.
let me explain: i play a lot of farming games and i love the genre. many of them share a number of common flaws however, such as shallow characters, weak non-farming mechanics, quest design that feels like chore. not in sandrock (or portia, for that matter)! the characters interact with each other in believable and lively ways. it's no longer that the player is the only thing that exists to them. everyone comes together to build a town and the player is only one small part of it. this makes the quests so much more believable.
what really impressed me was the way it differs from/improves upon portia. portia did a lot of things very well, but sandrock didn't just take those mechanics unchanged. instead, sandrock improved upon every little thing in portia that bothered me (e.g. the guns were a bit weak in portia; they're totally viable in sandrock) and also refreshed other aspects (e.g. i liked the fishing mini game in portia; sandrock changed the mini game but it's equally entertaining) so that series fans like me aren't bored.
the way the multiplayer is implemented is also quite good.
overall, i just love the thought and care the devs have put in this game. it's incredibly rare nowadays to see a game in a popular genre where the devs didn't settle for easy formulas and past success, but continue to improve. love everything about this game!",19735,Absolutely Love Game Favourite Farming Game Portia Sandrock Amazing Game Existence Happy Explain Play Lot Farming Games Love Genre Share Common Flaws Shallow Characters Weak Farming Mechanics Quest Design Feels Chore Sandrock Portia Matter Characters Interact Believable Lively Player Exists Build Town Player Quests Believable Impressed Differs Improves Portia Portia Lot Sandrock Mechanics Unchanged Sandrock Improved Portia Bothered Guns Bit Weak Portia Totally Viable Sandrock Refreshed Aspects Fishing Mini Game Portia Sandrock Changed Mini Game Equally Entertaining Series Fans Bored Multiplayer Implemented Love Care Devs Game Incredibly Rare Nowadays Game Popular Genre Devs Settle Easy Formulas Success Continue Improve Love Game,POSITIVE,1,0,49,11,0.8166666666666667

2023-11-05,"i purchased the game a few days before the official release, from an online recommendation, and i can honesty say that this is the best farm sim i've ever played. it improves on so many quality of life issues that i've experienced with other farming sims. being able to alter how quickly the time of day passes by and also having villagers that actually have depth to their characterization, voice acting and updated dialog that matches the game's story progression, it's a breath of fresh air. i love that villagers actually react to weather conditions, change their form of dress to suit the weather, and don't just stand outside like robots as if it were a regular sunny day. love the freedom and flexibility provided by designing your character's house and farmland. i also love the diversity in the cast of characters, they don't all look like they have the exact same cookie cutter anime body shape. 

also, being able to talk to npcs while still mounted on your horse, was a feature i was relived to see in this game. i cannot tell you how annoying it was playing games like harvest moon and having to get off your mount just to talk to someone, then jump back on your mount every single time. being able to access all storage boxes from a single storage unit, being able to complete fetch quest assignments with items that you're not carrying with you at the time, but are still in your storge inventory is also a wonderful addition. the animals in the game, whether they be farm animals or wild animals that you fight for exp have their own unique charm to them. love the fact that you can upgrade your horse and take photos with it. and the horse gallop and leaping animations are wonderful. 

i currently play this game on the steam deck and it's been a great experience. camera felt a little wonky at first, had to set the x and y camera sensitivity to 15 and the aim sensitivity to 40 for it to feel better on steam deck, so not sure if the defaults camera setting was set up for keyboard. other than a few floating foliage plants in the air, and utensils not appearing in an npc's hand while eating, the game has ran near prefectly on my steam deck. 

cannot wait for any future dlc planned by this dev. would love to see possibly mounted combat, or updated pets, enemy monsters, townsfolk, or farm animals. or having a game in the future where you can choose to be an antagonist or protagonist would be a welcome to see. my only complaint would be during character customization, i wish the character could have more body shape options then just looking like a stick. when you're a woman, it's a little frustrating not being able to give your character a figure or hips. but other than that, i have no other complaints about the game. i truly hope other developers can see the success of this franchise and use it as an example to improve theirs as well. like iron sharpening iron.",19735,Purchased Game Days Official Release Online Recommendation Honesty Farm Sim Played Improves Quality Life Issues Experienced Farming Sims Alter Time Day Passes Villagers Depth Characterization Voice Acting Updated Dialog Matches Game Story Progression Breath Fresh Air Love Villagers React Weather Conditions Change Form Dress Suit Weather Stand Robots Regular Sunny Day Love Freedom Flexibility Designing Character House Farmland Love Diversity Cast Characters Exact Cookie Cutter Anime Body Shape Talk Npcs Mounted Horse Feature Relived Game Annoying Playing Games Harvest Moon Mount Talk Jump Mount Single Time Access Storage Boxes Single Storage Unit Complete Fetch Quest Assignments Items Carrying Time Storge Inventory Wonderful Addition Animals Game Farm Animals Wild Animals Fight Exp Unique Charm Love Upgrade Horse Photos Horse Gallop Leaping Animations Wonderful Play Game Steam Deck Experience Camera Wonky Set Camera Sensitivity 15 Aim Sensitivity 40 Feel Steam Deck Defaults Camera Setting Set Keyboard Floating Foliage Plants Air Utensils Appearing Npc Hand Eating Game Prefectly Steam Deck Wait Future Dlc Planned Dev Love Mounted Combat Updated Pets Enemy Monsters Townsfolk Farm Animals Game Future Choose Antagonist Protagonist Complaint Character Customization Character Body Shape Options Stick Woman Frustrating Character Figure Hips Complaints Game Hope Developers Success Franchise Improve Iron Sharpening Iron,POSITIVE,1,0,49,11,0.8166666666666667

2023-11-26,"great game. must buy if you liked portia. minor spoilers below.
list of bugs i encountered throughout playing:
- characters get stuck into each other trying to exit a building
- you can climb along the cliff when you get to the ""mama tree"" and fall down the other side of the cliff of the desert and get stuck
- ""into the abyss"" mission you get a slow debuff that says 0sec duration but remains throughout the mission so i just spam roll everywhere.
- in the next dungeon after i had a slow and poison debuff of 0 sec that was permanent until i died and reloaded.
- once or twice loading screen didnt work when entering the house so i lost 20-30mins of progress (autosaves saved the day)
- everyone gets handed a medal but mc does a t-pose when receiving the medal
- mc becomes semi/fully transparent/invisible when mounting a horse and then briefly when dismounting.
- mounts and npcs constantly teleport to get to where they need to go so u have to ""catch them"" via dialogue before they fade with the wind.
- married amirah and her bd party is during one of the festivals so she didnt even attend her own party
- built the sand buggy on the assembly station and it was literally invisible
- was outside the house and my pet was stuck in the walls of my house
- bumble ants like to walk into the walls of my property (bad pathing)
- there are two enemies that no longer spawn due to game progression but civil commissions are still posted asking you to wipe them out.
- there were a couple instances where commissions are posted asking you to create an item using resources that are farmed in an area you dont have access to yet.

list of stuff i didnt like:
- too many relic pieces and i didnt want to spend the time looking/sorting through each storage box to find the duplicates so i would make multiple storage boxes which would have the same duplicate in multiple boxes
- max backpack space is a lot, but was still maxing it out more often than i wanted to as there are items (like gifts) i always kept on hand
- to 100% steam achievements in a reasonable time you need to talk and gift everyone from day 1 as social exp is a big grind otherwise
- weapon perks are unbalanced; why pick a 10% slow/burn/poison chance on hit when u can just go raw crit build with crit dmg, crit chance and lifedrain
- cant keep track of items donated to the museum unless you manually track it on spreadsheet (see guide in forums)
- when npc's steal your kill, you dont have that enemy registered to the bestiary, so if that enemy is a boss enemy that only spawns once, glhf. you also get no exp
- npc's run as fast as a slow horse, but you're stuck with the same runspeed throughout the game (exception is temporary buff in dungeon).
- read in forums automation doesnt give you workshop exp
- animals seemed like an afterthought since those buildings are maxed at lv 1, otherwise is a decent choice for extra side income
- thrown items were meh, and you cant use them to mine ores
- hard to build relationship pts with kids or animals since they dont post commissions so with animals you can only talk and gift once a day, (with kids you can also play critters)
- non essential npc's have nothing better to say other than ""...""
- va for musa is also a soldier.

things i did like:
- items from storage can be used to turn in items for quests
- good variety of characters/memorable personalities, but then there's people like jensen who has no backstory
- get to see how your projects build sandrock up, enjoyed the story and how it related to the last game
- ranged weapons are a pretty cheesy way of beating combat content 
- melee combat was good for a game not focused on combat
- enough perks to make more gol, make friends faster, make stuff faster, etc
- steam achievements are not difficult to achieve, but some are somewhat grindy unless you plan ahead. i think roughly 140hrs until i get 100%.
- you can go to options menu to speed up or slow down the game at leisure 0.6-3x so waiting for time related events doesnt take forever.

2023-11-25,"this game started off so well, really seeming to be portia but better. but the more i play it, the more issues i'm having. i've got a lot of unconnected thoughts, so i'll list the good and bad then put a summary at the botom.

[b]good:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]oustanding character design, personality, and development.[/b]
seriously some of the most lovable npcs in gaming. everyone has a unique and very well developed personality, with their own backstories and character arc.
[*][b]interesting world with a great concept to base the game off of.[/b]
sandrock has a well thought out history, and you have the goal of showing up while it's getting run down and on the decline, and having to turn it around to make it prosper. you do this by building new things to make the town grow, by uncovering lost technology from the old world long destroyed by the day of the calamity, and by fighting off the growing desert.
[*][b]lots to do.[/b]
farm, build, grow your workshop, decorate, connect with the townspeople, play minigames, catch fish, explore ruins, fight monsters etc. you know what to expect from games like this, and this game manages to include a wide variety of content better than most.
[*][b]humour.[/b]
there's a lot of funny jokes, silliness, nice references, and all sorts that will make you smile.
[*][b]coziness.[/b]
the game is so damn pleasant. there's so many issues with it which i'll get to, but despite them all i still found myself having a great time up until towards the end. it's just such a nice world to be in, it's so lovely learning about all the characters and gradually improving the town and your own workshop. it's really nice.
[*][b]immersion.[/b]
bit of a weird one, but this is something this game does well i think. you can get so absorbed and lost in this world. i love games that have the ability to make me forget the real world and just live in this virtual one for a week or two. this game nailed that. the fact i have 130 hours played after only starting 12 days ago shows what i mean, lol.
[/list]


[b]bad:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]performance.[/b]
the game takes a solid 5-10 minutes to load. this is a constant issue. going from one place to another has a very long loading screen, and even when it finishes loading, very few entities have actually loaded. buildings, menus, npcs, and objects all take an extra minute or so to load. sometimes they just don't load at all, and you'll have to restart the game. i've never had so much issues with load times in a game.
[*][b]the game is extremely grindy and tedious.[/b]
i'm 130 hours in and not even made it halfway towards finishing some things. i'm not exaggerating. i'm still not even done with the story, and from what the achievements tell me, neither are 99% of the people playing the game. collecting resources is extremely repetitive and slow, so is crafting, so is befriending people, and fighting, and pretty much every aspect of the game. everything is painfully longwinded and drawn out, taking a ridiculously long time for little payoff.
[*][b]length.[/b]
i'm never one to complain about how long a game is, the more there is to do the happier i am. this game is the one exception to that. all the story points feel so disjointed. it could end at so many points, but it has to add a new twist or an entirely new and unrelated story every time, which adds an extra 30 hours to the game each time. why has the story gone from developing this town, to catching a bandit, to [spoiler]rescuing a rat princess, to fighting in a war.[/spoiler] it strays so so far from the starting point that it's hard to stay interested, and that brings me to my next point.
[*][b]story.[/b]
it starts off so good, but what on earth happened. at some point you need to stop and question if what you're doing makes sense, and this game just doesn't. the game throws plot twist after plot twist at you, without putting much thought into any of them. none of them make sense, none of them are good ideas, it just feels like it's elongating this already immensely long game for no actual benefit.
[*][b]quality.[/b]
the game is very janky, which i personally think is fine for the most part, but it's worth mentioning. combat has you zipping around erratically, you can walk up almost vertical walls, mounts control awfully, camera movement during dialogue often puts the camera in an object, every cutscene is broken if there's a sandstorm going on, sandstorm gear is pointless, there are almost no quality of life features, lots of invisible walls, there's not much attention to detail, and many features of the game feel very barebones. there's a lot more i could mention but this is already too long. the game just feels very much like they set their ambitions higher than they're able to reach. the fact i've got myself softlocked four times, and just downloaded a week 2 update which fixes 90+ bugs says a lot about the game. it just isn't well made.
[*][b]multiplayer[/b]
when this game was announced, it was planned to have multiplayer. not long before the release of the game, they decided to change that, after already receiving backing and early access purchases from people who were promised the game would have multiplayer. the game now has the most barebones and pointless multiplayer you can ask for, with no story or any of what makes the game fun.
[/list]

to summarise, this game has so much potential. it's a lovely idea, with some elements like character development and world building done remarkably well. however, the poor quality of the game, slow deterioration of the story, and incredibly monotonous gameplay results in a very mediocre overall experience. i don't like giving a thumbs down, because i do like the game, but i don't think it's very good. if there was a neutral option i'd pick it.",11769,Game Started Portia Play Issues Lot Unconnected List Bad Summary Botom List Oustanding Character Design Personality Development Lovable Npcs Gaming Unique Developed Personality Backstories Character Arc Concept Base Game Sandrock History Goal Decline Prosper Building Town Grow Uncovering Lost Technology Destroyed Day Calamity Fighting Growing Desert Lots Farm Build Grow Workshop Decorate Connect Townspeople Play Minigames Catch Fish Explore Ruins Fight Monsters Expect Games Game Manages Include Wide Variety Content Humour Lot Funny Jokes Silliness Nice References Sorts Smile Coziness Game Damn Pleasant Issues Time Nice Lovely Learning Characters Gradually Improving Town Workshop Nice Immersion Bit Weird Game Absorbed Lost Love Games Ability Forget Real Live Virtual Week Game Nailed 130 Hours Played Starting 12 Days Lol List Bad List Performance Game Takes Solid 5 Minutes Load Constant Issue Loading Screen Finishes Loading Entities Loaded Buildings Menus Npcs Objects Extra Minute Load Load Restart Game Issues Load Times Game Game Extremely Grindy Tedious 130 Hours Halfway Finishing Exaggerating Story Achievements 99 People Playing Game Collecting Resources Extremely Repetitive Slow Crafting Befriending People Fighting Pretty Aspect Game Painfully Longwinded Drawn Ridiculously Time Payoff Complain Game Happier Game Exception Story Feel Disjointed Add Twist Unrelated Story Time Adds Extra 30 Hours Game Time Story Developing Town Catching Bandit Spoiler Rescuing Rat Princess Fighting War Spoiler Strays Starting Hard Stay Brings Story Starts Earth Happened Question Sense Game Game Throws Plot Twist Plot Twist Putting Sense Ideas Feels Elongating Immensely Game Actual Benefit Quality Game Janky Personally Fine Worth Mentioning Combat Zipping Erratically Walk Vertical Walls Mounts Control Camera Movement Dialogue Camera Object Cutscene Broken Sandstorm Sandstorm Gear Pointless Quality Life Features Lots Invisible Walls Attention Features Game Feel Barebones Lot Mention Game Feels Set Ambitions Reach Softlocked Times Downloaded Week 2 Update Fixes 90 Bugs Lot Game Multiplayer Game Announced Planned Multiplayer Release Game Decided Change Receiving Access Purchases People Promised Game Multiplayer Game Barebones Pointless Multiplayer Story Game Fun List Summarise Game Potential Lovely Idea Elements Character Development Building Remarkably Poor Quality Game Slow Deterioration Story Incredibly Monotonous Gameplay Mediocre Experience Thumbs Game Neutral Option Pick,POSITIVE,1,0,82,9,0.9010989010989011

my time at sandrock (mtas) nails that sense of progression that my time at portia (mtap) pioneered. as ye be making ye adventures, ye'll be changing sandrock, from buildin' cranes te' fixing the hydrogel, expanding the yakmel network to more serious ventures like plantin' forests in the desert and building the road to portia. 

for each quest chain ye complete, you'll get reminders just how far ye've came. making ye feel apart of the world, and ultimately it's my most favourite draw to mtas.

[b]craftin'[/b]
goin' hand in hand with makin' ye changes in sandrock, the crafting is an improvement upon mtap. ye have a bounty o' machines to be gettin' ye buildin. most days ye'll be havin' machines runnin' all day pumpin out manner o things for ye designs. ingots, screws, slabs, everything to be gettin' everythin' built. occasionally, you'll feel overwhelmed but honestly, i felt that it feed it the hectic job that is bein' a builder in mtas. ye'll eventually condense this into ye crown jewel near the end, the almighty factory.

[b]exploration[/b]
the world of sandrock is huge and thar be plenty to see and dive. you'll be prowlin' through dangerous ruins, fighting robots and mobs for parts ye need for your builds and ye'll be spendin' a fair chunk o' ye time in the abandoned ruins, bringin' up various ores and relics to both smelt and reassemble. i've got no complaints.

[b]the characters[/b]
in this pirates honest opinions, the characters in mtas shine far brighter then those in portia. every character has a small chain that details there daily lives and a insight to their personality. it added that depth to life and some reason to care about the characters compared to portia, the massively expanded amount of quests featured in mtas, really helped in this situation.

[h3]nays[/h3]

[b]combat[/b]
thar has been a' few changes to combat, however, it still be simplistic. you'll be finding yourself usin' the same strategies ye found in portia. ye'll be dodging the choreographed events, going in to break' em and then just devastating 'em. it's the same ole' song and dance. it be worse with guns, ye'll whip your pistol o' rifle and just stun lock and break your enemy in place, making short work out most o' everything. disappointin' really.

[b]performance[/b]
this be nay gay breakin' but ye'll certainly notice it in ye adventurin'. mtas doesn't play aswell as portia, ye have pop in galore, especially o' anything ye've added to the world via the quests. the game chugs in the town itself and has random slow downs in various places. it can detract from ye' experience.

the small positive is for me, is that the game has mostly been light on bugs and pathea has been on the ball since release. 

[b]dlc practices[/b]
i hated to be addin' this one but £4.49 for costumes for 4 characters and putting the favourites separate in individual packs is a practice that belongs in davey jones locker. either bundle them together for a tenner or reduce the price of the individuals. currently it looks a cash grab and add as a tarnish to this shining treasure.

[h3]conclusion n' scoring[/h3]
mtas is a large game and it's hard to condense everything inte' a few paragraphs. it's a massive improvement on mtap. if ye loved that game, ye'll be right at home here. a no brainer for ye doubloons.

if ye the kind of sailor that loves a solid sense o' progression with an in-depth crafting system, memorable characters and a massive chain of quests to go on and doesn't mind some minor annoyances and lacklustre combat system. ye'll definitely find some good sailing 'ere.

i give mtas a solid 8.5/10 gold doubloons. a massive improvement over portia if not marred by spotty performance and cheap dlc tactics.",9744,H2 Ahoy H2 Local Piratical Reviewer Comin Time Sandrock Worth Precious Doubloons Briny Depths Played Predecessor Time Portia Completin Makin Comparisons Em Splittin Ayes Nays Easy Readin H3 Ayes H3 Real Sense Progression Time Sandrock Mtas Nails Sense Progression Time Portia Mtap Pioneered Adventures Changing Sandrock Buildin Cranes Te Fixing Hydrogel Expanding Yakmel Network Ventures Plantin Forests Desert Building Road Portia Quest Chain Complete Reminders Feel Ultimately Favourite Draw Mtas Craftin Goin Hand Hand Makin Sandrock Crafting Improvement Mtap Bounty Machines Gettin Buildin Days Havin Machines Runnin Day Pumpin Manner Designs Ingots Screws Slabs Gettin Everythin Built Occasionally Feel Overwhelmed Honestly Feed Hectic Job Bein Builder Mtas Eventually Condense Crown Jewel Almighty Factory Exploration Sandrock Huge Thar Plenty Dive Prowlin Dangerous Ruins Fighting Robots Mobs Builds Spendin Fair Chunk Time Abandoned Ruins Bringin Ores Relics Smelt Reassemble Complaints Characters Pirates Honest Opinions Characters Mtas Shine Brighter Portia Character Chain Details Daily Lives Insight Personality Depth Life Reason Care Characters Compared Portia Massively Expanded Quests Featured Mtas Helped Situation H3 Nays H3 Combat Thar Combat Simplistic Finding Usin Strategies Portia Dodging Choreographed Events Break Em Devastating Em Ole Song Dance Worse Guns Whip Pistol Rifle Stun Lock Break Enemy Short Disappointin Performance Gay Breakin Notice Adventurin Mtas Play Aswell Portia Pop Galore Quests Game Chugs Town Random Slow Detract Experience Positive Game Light Bugs Pathea Ball Release Dlc Practices Hated Addin 4 49 Costumes 4 Characters Putting Favourites Separate Individual Packs Practice Belongs Davey Jones Locker Bundle Tenner Reduce Price Individuals Cash Grab Add Tarnish Shining Treasure H3 Conclusion Scoring H3 Mtas Game Hard Condense Inte Paragraphs Massive Improvement Mtap Loved Game Brainer Doubloons Sailor Loves Solid Sense Progression Depth Crafting Memorable Characters Massive Chain Quests Mind Minor Annoyances Lacklustre Combat Sailing Ere Mtas Solid 8 5 Gold Doubloons Massive Improvement Portia Marred Spotty Performance Cheap Dlc Tactics,POSITIVE,1,0,139,6,0.9586206896551724

2023-11-23,"one of my favorite games of all time. has the most complex social aspects i've seen in a game and what we usually all wanted for years with life sim games. other devs should take notes, honestly. 

the best part about this game: there is always plenty things to do, and they are all fun and useful, a lot of life sim games might have you build useless things. almost everything you build gets used in events, main story content, bridges to unlock new areas, oh, and there is always new places being unlocked as you progress, immersive atmosphere, new characters being introduced, and i mean years in-game. 408 hrs (continued from early access save) and i am still unlocking new characters, areas, story content.

all the characters are well voice and well written. and by well written---really, well written. i don't think i can play a harvest moon or story of seasons game after this tbh. it's spoiled me. the characters are fleshed out wonderfully, with their own thought out pasts, stories, you can talk about them in convo during play dates, or romantic ones. some characters have reverse confessions and characters have romance and friendship quests as well as multiple in story quests where other characters will talk and interact with you and eachother. i guarantee you will feel some emotion for every single one of these characters. characters i didn't like or care about before i got to know i grew to like later, their flaws and their traits both, and their stories. 

this is one of the most immersive games i've experienced. it makes you feel apart of the community, and the seratonin boosts you get just from speaking to villagers, getting gifts outside your house on your birthday or wedding day, having your partner ask if you'd like to spend the day together after marriage and take you on little dates when most games are like 'they are married, have kids' and it's either the end, or they are blank nobodies now that have no more content whatsoever! this game doesn't do that. 

if sandrock gets more content dlc or in the next my time game, if they decide to have a kid system, i'd rather no kids unless there is real content for them, this is what the people want pathea, even if you charge $ for it:

-family outings/content and story events with your child/partner, and with the townsfolk
-the child going to school/interacting with other children
-old enough to speak properly/help out around the work shop or be interested in another profession/maybe story content for the kid following qi or owen around if they wanted to work as a scientist apprentice/at the blue moon as a chef or waiter or something.  ((not neccessary, just would be super cute. i would just rather not have kids in a game, like how stardew did unless they have content, sandrock still beat the others for sure though.)) and maybe a better child system to know when your child needs something/bring them with you on a baby backpack or hire a babysitter if you can't be home.

i'm definitely doing another playthrough. it's easy to miss dialogue and content because there is so much((this is a good thing.)) we got so lucky with my time at sandrock and i feel like i would 100% die for any of the sandrockers fr. the story gets better and better. sometimes it's silly, sometimes it's serious, sometimes it's just fun. 

characters you befriend will someetimes show up outside your house because they miss you and want to hang out, and sometimes you will see a lot of ! events to unlock, where you can say to much is going on right now and get to it later.

you might walk into someones home and they are eating dinner together, arvios sister is visiting him, or the preacher is teaching jasmine how to speak politely if she didn't like an authors book. little details that bring life

oh, and don't get me started on the holidays. only game i cared about holidays. you have mini games on almost every one, from collecting ingredients on a yakmel and can bump into other people, grilling up food for the towns folk, a dance competition, and so much more.

on dates with friends and romantically, you can set off fireworks in a fun pattern of your choosing, draw in the sand, play whack a mole or games at the arcade, sit and talk on a bench or go out to eat and order them food. you can befriend folks easily without gift spamming. talking to them, being yourself and taking commissions/work on the request or commission board they asked for is helpful. some characters might need to unlock events to get there story or even be able to give gifts to them if they are more to themselves.

the personalities are well thought out. characters with pasts, multiple hobbies likes and dislikes, where most games the 'fisherman' is just a fisherman and nothing more, his entire personality. you will hear them talk about their family, their other interests, and things they like. the characters entire personality isnt just a trope or based around 1 thing. this is the best character development as well for some characters i've seen in a long time. i highly reccomend buying this. it will be a blast constantly.

usually life sims have moments when your bored. well 400 hrs in and still constant content. i'm just saying....i hope this becomes the new standard for life sims xd

2023-11-23,"i don't leave reviews often so let me explain why i am this time first then i'll talk about sandrock.  back in 2014 i bought pathea's (first?  think so?) game called planet explorers.  i loved it at first but it had such a long development then in 2016 they ""full released"" the game, all while i still encountered game breaking bugs in the first 10min of gameplay that i had when i first started the game in '14.  coming off of also getting burned on several other steam greenlight games (yall remember that s**t?!), i swore that i would never, ever, buy another pathea game again..... then in 2018 i saw this cute game pop up in my feed called my time at portia, i was immediately in love with the art style and premise of the game and bought immediately, somehow missing the pathea logos and name the entire time.  by the time i realized that they were made by the same devs i had like some 100+hrs in portia and exhausted all the content even available at the time.  i did become a bit doomer and just awaited it to just disappear into history as another abandoned game.... well i have 300+ hours in portia now and it ranks as one of my favorite games of all time.  so firstly, i want to thank pathea games for doing a complete flip in my book and coming out with absolute bangers that have lost me many hours in workshop (my real one not the one in game, that workshop gets overused!)

now, lets talk about sandrock specifically (no story spoilers dont worry).  i had no idea it was even coming until it was too late to even back it on kickstarted and i hated myself for it!  i mean look at sandrock!  it has everything i love portia and then just completely redid it or made it even better.  the art style is such a nice thing to look at, the animations feel so much more complete and the gameplay feels nice and balanced and gives you full freedom to play how you will with very little in the way of forcing progress except when you really want to.  don't wanna go ultra super heavy into making your workshop mega and just wanna socialize?  you got it!  or you can do what i do and take #1 builder before the first month is even over (suck it yan!). the characters are all so lovable or just absolutely memorable to me, pen is such a over the top dude, yan while being your main 'rival' doesn't like actively take commissions from you like higgins did (no more sprinting off to the guild to grab the good commissions before he does), and miguel as much as i don't like him like him i at least have an understanding of him and even at times sympathize with his views.  i was put off at first by how you get more resources from recyclers rather than just straight gather (which there is still plenty of!) but in time i grew to really enjoy that i could have all them crunching for copper while i go get iron.  everything about it feels so well thought and improved from portia while not feeling like they just ctrl+c ctrl+v.  while it does get tedious at first managing both water and fuel for machines it became second nature when i run over to machine to start new production to just auto fill with dregs and i rarely had an issue anymore of machine out of water/fuel(by the way never ever use your wood for fuel just go slap some powerstones or get some dregs, thank me later).  the greatest improvement imo is combat which feels leagues ahead of the combat i remember from portia and i actually like dungeon diving now (before it was more ugh ok i guess ill go...).  socializing also feels alot easier in this game, admittedly i tend to always put socializing on the back burner but in my now post release game everyone loves me.  the one thing i really complained about was it felt like i had not enough time to do everything i wanted because i had to run here or there to get things done but that got solved when i found the time slider, won't really help you crunch resources faster since those are timed to in game time, but it's easier to run home and start something to turn in a com without running out of time due to me spending time walking, i found that a .67 time setting to be a nice sweet spot for getting places without dragging a day too long.  

and on the story itself, again, no spoilers, but it's good, really good imo.  it kept me hooked and interested the whole way, and also laughing because this game doesn't try to make everything so serious even in the more serious parts of the game (there's always a punch line xd). i got so excited in the last major update before release that i couldn't help myself but again play all through the twist and turns of what i think is the climax of the game (haven't full played on release yet so idk if theres even more after that!) and even after completing it i didn't feel like i was done or satisfied, there was still more work to do, still more commissions to get and more to build and to get sandrock back to its former glory (and even better!).  before release, i had just shy of 300hrs in sandrock and in the past 2 weeks, even with my bloated work schedule these days ive blown 80hrs in my new playthough and i can definately see myself blowing another 300 on this game before i get 'tired' of it. 

the tldr of it is, yes, buy this game.  you'll love it, play how you want to play, don't get the biggest baddest workshop if you dont want to, dont socialize alot if you dont want to.  or do!  sit back, relax, take a load off your mind and just create and have fun or go full try hard and show that yan dude whose the real newbie.  and pathea, from the just in my opinion let down of planet explorers, you have my eternal gratitude for portia and sandrock and you have won me fully back and just eager for the day the next my time at x game comes out (highwind!? altara? i mean coooommmmee ooooonnnn!!!)

2023-11-23,"[h1]i liked it.[/h1]
i liked portia, and i liked this game. just finished it! lots to do, the story is much more significant than i expected. thumbs up.

...with caveats. i had hoped that this time around we'd be able to avoid some of the pitfalls that portia had, and there were exotic new pitfalls to enjoy as well.

[h2]spoilers ahead, sorry. skip to conclusion for non-spoilery assessment[/h2]

[h3]the good[/h3]
[list]
[*]unsuur
[*]lots of story content, more than portia
[*]you get to feel epic as the townies come to respect you
[*]the civil corps of sandrock acknowledges you as an honorary member instead of pretending for the entire game that they are stronger than you in spite of your combat prowess like the civil corps of portia did
[*]didn't rely pretty much at all on any of the old workshop machines from the old game, and new models where there was overlap
[*]had a much more effective environmental message, where portia kind of deliberately put you at odds with the environmentalists in the game while trying to talk about the importance of environmentalism
[*]some (some) of the voice acting was pretty good
[*]i liked the weapon variety and specialization you could do through knowledge points
[*]did a decent job of making it so you could stop hunting for older, low-level ore and minerals while still making you track down new ores and occasional rarities like engines and stuff.
[*]datable men in this game are way hotter than in portia. so are the women, but the glow-up award goes to the guys. much better fleshed out personalities across the board too.
[*]i really liked hanging out and dating being instant instead of scheduled for a specific time the next day.
[/list]

[h3]the bad[/h3]
[list]
[*]arvio
[*]nearly every model that's not a permanent feature of the landscape takes a long time to load in
[*]quite a bit of the voice acting and sound design is somewhere between questionable and bad
[*]pacing is often weird. see section below.
[*]dating and hanging out still isn't fun
[*]there is no contest whatsoever in the builder rankings. i beat yan in year one without trouble, and in year two mi-an didn't come close. i could have done just one commission a day and i still would have been miles ahead. i expected mi-an to surge ahead to at least claim some yan-level numbers once yan wasn't taking credit for all her work, but she just wasn't remotely a threat.
[*]there was not nearly enough variety in the commissions. never-ending metal ingots, metal plates, stone slabs, petrified wood planks and sticks, and canvas were my reward for climbing to five stars. why aren't people commissioning more, you know... built stuff?
[*]what the hell happened to the factory? in portia it had an awesome animated interior and dedicated upgrade options. in sandrock it's an ugly living room with all your machines crammed into it as cramped as you can manage. in portia it worked with the automated half of your assembly station, but in sandrock you wish you could just delete your assembly station entirely because you'll never use it again.
[*]i never once used a powerstone of either grade. i found it impossible to run out of dregs.
[*]i love merle, but i wanted a goat with rambo's horns.
[*]there's a whole upgrade in the abandoned ruins goggles to let you see the outline of the items you scan. only problem is every scannable item is smaller than the diamond indicator so you'll never actually see the outline of anything. portia had no such issue.
[*]sandrock fails in multiple instances to teach you about functions of the game. i never once learned to use a camera, so i had a whopping zero photos at the end of the game. i was made aware of the existence of parties thanks to the resources i had to make them go over well, but i only learned from the end credits that i was supposed to purchase and set up a banquet table to unlock this feature. i discovered that many of the datable npcs have outfit options in the social menu. i never found out how to make those happen. the fashion show seemed like the time for that to unlock, but the outfits were never made purchaseable, despite barber guy's enthusiasm about selling them in his dialogue. i thought maybe it was dlc, but it turns out it's not, so how was that meant to unlock? maybe after you marry them? nope. still no idea.
[*]i gave grace a custom pet name to call me when we got married. she just called me sugar instead.
[*]i am genuinely unsure if there are enough small items to donate to the museum to successfully fill the small item slots available
[*]the house builder interface is janky as hell. sometimes you just have to quit and go back in to get anything done as various items refuse to bring up their interaction options, become unmovable, become unresizable, or just plain disappear because of an errant click. was it a workshop machine? then don't bother checking your inventory or the ""workshop machine"" menu on the builder interface, because it's now in your mailbox. so better get your ass back home to get that item and then head back to the house builder thing to try and remember what you were doing.
[/list]

pacing issues
[list]
[*]i earned a greenhouse before i was ever able to develop a single tile of biocrust naturally, despite nonstop gardening starting the moment gardening was available. even without the greenhouse, the main story gifted me enough biocrust to make generating it manually a pointless feature.
[*]i was excited to get my max-level spear, but i earned the laser sword before i could make one and it was the indisputable optimal choice, rendering my knowledge points in spears worthless
[*]in portia the final build, a plane, blindsides you with a sudden need for truckloads of crystals you never thought to harvest before and makes you take in-game weeks just waiting for them to spawn so you can finish the quest. sandrock's elegant answer to this problem is to make the final build embarrassingly easy to complete. you'll probably have it finished in an afternoon with materials you had laying around. please, by all means, send me on a couple days of fetching to get the parts i need for this once-in-a-game build. they're never going to ask for another one, so make them unique items that i need to fight some boss monsters to obtain or something. i don't know, but ""a single expedition's worth of nanomaterial scrap and poplar wood and (checks notes) an item made a tiny amount of copper and bronze"" can't possibly be the best answer.
[*]in both portia and sandrock, the factory is a double-edged sword. it feels awesome to unlock godmode in your workshop, but you'll never have to think meaningfully about any commissions or build quests again. that's the day you go from bustling builder to rare material scavenger, and there's no going back, really. it was also too cheap and easy to have a factory in this game. couple grand, you're good to go. at least in portia you had to gather a mess of expensive materials and pony up the cash.
[*]you'll have the max-level workshop equipment by about the halfway point of the game. upgrading feels nice, so it's sad when this goes away so soon.
[/list]

[h3]conclusion[/h3]
this is a fundamentally fun game that, like its predecessor, is deeply flawed. it has heart, but it feels unfinished in a way i know they're not going to fix. i had hoped portia would serve as a learning experience that would lead to sandrock being far more optimized out the gate. instead, it's genuinely unclear if they learned much of anything from portia's issues.

would i buy a new entry in this series in the future? well... probably. because they did at least prove they have some fun new ideas that do iterate successfully on the ""my time at"" formula. but at this point pathea is cementing itself in my head as a studio with a lot of muscle in the ideas department, but anemic in the polish department. the public is growing weary of studios that can't release a finished game.",9123,H1 H1 Portia Game Finished Lots Story Expected Thumbs Caveats Hoped Time Avoid Pitfalls Portia Exotic Pitfalls Enjoy H2 Spoilers Skip Conclusion Spoilery Assessment H2 H3 H3 List Unsuur Lots Story Content Portia Feel Epic Townies Respect Civil Corps Sandrock Acknowledges Honorary Pretending Entire Game Stronger Spite Combat Prowess Civil Corps Portia Rely Pretty Workshop Machines Game Models Overlap Effective Environmental Message Portia Deliberately Odds Environmentalists Game Talk Environmentalism Voice Acting Pretty Weapon Variety Specialization Knowledge Decent Job Hunting Level Ore Minerals Track Ores Occasional Rarities Engines Stuff Datable Game Hotter Portia Women Glow Award Guys Fleshed Personalities Board Hanging Dating Instant Scheduled Specific Time Day List H3 Bad H3 List Arvio Model Permanent Feature Landscape Takes Time Load Bit Voice Acting Sound Design Questionable Bad Pacing Weird Dating Hanging Fun Contest Whatsoever Builder Rankings Beat Yan Trouble Mi Close Commission Day Miles Expected Mi Surge Claim Yan Level Yan Credit Remotely Threat Variety Commissions Metal Ingots Metal Plates Stone Slabs Petrified Wood Planks Sticks Canvas Reward Climbing Stars People Commissioning Built Stuff Happened Factory Portia Awesome Animated Interior Dedicated Upgrade Options Sandrock Ugly Living Machines Crammed Cramped Manage Portia Automated Assembly Station Sandrock Delete Assembly Station Powerstone Grade Impossible Dregs Love Merle Goat Rambo Horns Upgrade Abandoned Ruins Goggles Outline Items Scan Scannable Item Diamond Indicator Outline Portia Issue Sandrock Fails Multiple Instances Teach Functions Game Learned Camera Whopping Photos Game Aware Existence Parties Resources Learned Credits Supposed Purchase Set Banquet Table Unlock Feature Discovered Datable Npcs Outfit Options Social Menu Happen Fashion Time Unlock Outfits Purchaseable Barber Guy Enthusiasm Selling Dialogue Dlc Meant Unlock Marry Nope Idea Grace Custom Pet Married Called Sugar Genuinely Unsure Items Donate Museum Item Slots House Builder Interface Janky Quit Items Refuse Bring Interaction Options Unmovable Unresizable Plain Disappear Errant Workshop Machine Bother Checking Inventory Workshop Machine Menu Builder Interface Mailbox Ass Item Head House Builder Remember List Pacing Issues List Earned Greenhouse Develop Single Tile Biocrust Naturally Nonstop Gardening Starting Moment Gardening Greenhouse Main Story Gifted Biocrust Generating Manually Pointless Feature Excited Max Level Spear Earned Laser Sword Indisputable Optimal Choice Rendering Knowledge Spears Worthless Portia Final Build Plane Blindsides Sudden Truckloads Crystals Harvest Game Weeks Waiting Spawn Finish Quest Sandrock Elegant Answer Final Build Embarrassingly Easy Complete Finished Afternoon Materials Laying Send Couple Days Fetching Game Build Unique Items Fight Boss Monsters Single Expedition Worth Nanomaterial Scrap Poplar Wood Checks Notes Item Tiny Copper Bronze Answer Portia Sandrock Factory Double Edged Sword Feels Awesome Unlock Godmode Workshop Meaningfully Commissions Build Quests Day Bustling Builder Rare Material Scavenger Cheap Easy Factory Game Couple Grand Portia Gather Mess Expensive Materials Pony Cash Max Level Workshop Equipment Halfway Game Upgrading Feels Nice Sad List H3 Conclusion H3 Fundamentally Fun Game Predecessor Deeply Flawed Heart Feels Unfinished Hoped Portia Serve Learning Experience Lead Sandrock Optimized Gate Genuinely Unclear Learned Portia Issues Entry Series Future Prove Fun Ideas Iterate Time Formula Pathea Cementing Head Studio Lot Muscle Ideas Department Anemic Polish Department Public Growing Weary Studios Release Finished Game,POSITIVE,1,0,147,16,0.901840490797546

2023-11-22,"mtas is, from the get-go, very similar to its predecessor my time at portia and for the most part that holds true as this was supposed to be an expansion before turning into a separate project.

does it separate itself enough to warrant a separate purchase? i believe so, although i believe the price increased since early access when i purchased it.

initially i was put off by the chosen setting as having a farming game be set in a desolate desert setting seemed like a tall order but the developers managed to introduce new mechanics to account for this without removing one of the core parts of the original game. i will not go into detail as some of these mechanics are also tied to the story which is appreciated as well. they may seem a bit tedious at the beginning but eventually as with the previous games most of the energy/water requirements become trivial from simply farming out other resources which i find to be nice as the game is already pretty grindy as its predecessor was in some aspects. a quick tip: do try to get a pet asap as they help a ton.
how grindy the game feels however depends on what you as the player would like to do and how stressed you feel about worker of the month/year nominations. if you want to keep ahead you will be farming 3-4 commissions daily as well as blowing all your stamina in abandoned ruins which can become a bit of a repetitive chore (for me this feeling started somewhere around winter 1st year). in order to avoid this i would recommend engaging with other parts of the game as well (hangouts/romance/building the house/farm) and not feeling like you need to squeeze out every ounce of stamina out of every day otherwise you will burn out quickly.

in terms of the story i still have not reached the complete conclusion but i believe nobody expected this game to bring out a game of the year contender in this regard.
if there is one thing however i would say that the pacing feels off for me. lot of the progression is gated by arbitrary amounts of days that have to pass in order for you to even receive an email that will tell you (at the beginning of a given day) that the story will continue 2 days from now. after those 2 days pass you usually go to a fireside meeting where they will say something usually followed by another day or 2 of waiting which became a real point of frustration as i already blew through all the mining/building content and needed story to progress to access the 3rd abandoned ruins which never seem to come. at this point i am in year 2 spring and i have been done with all that 2nd abandoned ruins offer in year 1 day 26 autumn which means i spent most of winter just running around hoping a side-quest would appear or the story would hurry up and come but it never did as from what i read i am still a few mysterious letters off from actually getting to the ruins. feels like i am being drip fed story at this point which would be fine if i was not done with everything i can do in a given day at about 3pm with plenty of time to spare.

hangouts/romance are pretty similar to what they were in portia but i appreciate the variety of characters that are available although i do miss papa bear. i thought sandy was going to be a nice replacement for papa bear for me but the sound that camel makes evoke some primordial feelings of horror in me so i avoid her usually.
one thing that i find odd is how easy it is to become a bff with heidi specifically since many of the commissions are from her so even if i do not really care about her she is my best friend stat-wise since avoiding her commissions would be hamstringing my progress too much. of course with addition of a bounty board this levels out a bit as those requests (at least in my experience) came from a variety of characters usually not requesting standard commissions like elsie for example who in my play-through appeared on standard commission board maybe twice with a incredibly simple request that yields almost no rewards.

all in all it might seem like i am airing my grievances with the game which is true but i still really like it for what it is. it may not be perfect owing to the points above or the bugs which still plague it but i do believe it is a great experience for people who liked the first game and builds upon it well. the grind feels satisfying when done in moderation and there are a lot of options for customizing your yard and house. romance options are plenty and compared to the first game there seem to be more post-marriage content.
i do hope future brings more bugfixes and even content if we should be so lucky.

p.s.
if a sequel ever comes i do hope for a different environment though as portia was also 1/3 if not 1/2 desert which i understand is a rather major plot point in the overall story but i am kind of over sand now, thanks.",9290,Mtas Predecessor Time Portia Holds True Supposed Expansion Separate Project Separate Warrant Separate Purchase Price Increased Access Purchased Initially Chosen Setting Farming Game Set Desolate Desert Setting Tall Developers Managed Introduce Mechanics Account Removing Core Original Game Mechanics Tied Story Appreciated Bit Tedious Eventually Previous Games Energy Water Requirements Trivial Simply Farming Resources Nice Game Pretty Grindy Predecessor Aspects Quick Pet Asap Ton Grindy Game Feels Depends Player Stressed Feel Worker Month Nominations Farming 3 4 Commissions Daily Blowing Stamina Abandoned Ruins Bit Repetitive Chore Feeling Started Winter 1St Avoid Recommend Engaging Game Hangouts Romance Building House Farm Feeling Squeeze Ounce Stamina Day Burn Terms Story Reached Complete Conclusion Expected Game Bring Game Contender Regard Pacing Feels Lot Progression Gated Arbitrary Amounts Days Pass Receive Email Day Story Continue 2 Days 2 Days Pass Fireside Meeting Day 2 Waiting Real Frustration Blew Mining Building Content Story Progress Access 3Rd Abandoned Ruins 2 Spring 2Nd Abandoned Ruins Offer 1 Day 26 Autumn Spent Winter Running Hoping Quest Story Hurry Read Mysterious Letters Ruins Feels Drip Fed Story Fine Day 3Pm Plenty Time Spare Hangouts Romance Pretty Portia Variety Characters Papa Bear Sandy Nice Replacement Papa Bear Sound Camel Evoke Primordial Feelings Horror Avoid Odd Easy Bff Heidi Commissions Care Friend Stat Wise Avoiding Commissions Hamstringing Progress Addition Bounty Board Levels Bit Requests Experience Variety Characters Requesting Standard Commissions Elsie Play Appeared Standard Commission Board Incredibly Simple Request Yields Rewards Airing Grievances Game True Perfect Bugs Plague Experience People Game Builds Grind Feels Satisfying Moderation Lot Options Customizing Yard House Romance Options Plenty Compared Game Post Marriage Content Hope Future Brings Bugfixes Content Lucky Sequel Hope Environment Portia 1 3 1 2 Desert Understand Major Plot Story Sand,POSITIVE,1,0,247,20,0.9250936329588015
2023-11-26,"great game. must buy if you liked portia. minor spoilers below.
list of bugs i encountered throughout playing:
- characters get stuck into each other trying to exit a building
- you can climb along the cliff when you get to the ""mama tree"" and fall down the other side of the cliff of the desert and get stuck
- ""into the abyss"" mission you get a slow debuff that says 0sec duration but remains throughout the mission so i just spam roll everywhere.
- in the next dungeon after i had a slow and poison debuff of 0 sec that was permanent until i died and reloaded.
- once or twice loading screen didnt work when entering the house so i lost 20-30mins of progress (autosaves saved the day)
- everyone gets handed a medal but mc does a t-pose when receiving the medal
- mc becomes semi/fully transparent/invisible when mounting a horse and then briefly when dismounting.
- mounts and npcs constantly teleport to get to where they need to go so u have to ""catch them"" via dialogue before they fade with the wind.
- married amirah and her bd party is during one of the festivals so she didnt even attend her own party
- built the sand buggy on the assembly station and it was literally invisible
- was outside the house and my pet was stuck in the walls of my house
- bumble ants like to walk into the walls of my property (bad pathing)
- there are two enemies that no longer spawn due to game progression but civil commissions are still posted asking you to wipe them out.
- there were a couple instances where commissions are posted asking you to create an item using resources that are farmed in an area you dont have access to yet.

list of stuff i didnt like:
- too many relic pieces and i didnt want to spend the time looking/sorting through each storage box to find the duplicates so i would make multiple storage boxes which would have the same duplicate in multiple boxes
- max backpack space is a lot, but was still maxing it out more often than i wanted to as there are items (like gifts) i always kept on hand
- to 100% steam achievements in a reasonable time you need to talk and gift everyone from day 1 as social exp is a big grind otherwise
- weapon perks are unbalanced; why pick a 10% slow/burn/poison chance on hit when u can just go raw crit build with crit dmg, crit chance and lifedrain
- cant keep track of items donated to the museum unless you manually track it on spreadsheet (see guide in forums)
- when npc's steal your kill, you dont have that enemy registered to the bestiary, so if that enemy is a boss enemy that only spawns once, glhf. you also get no exp
- npc's run as fast as a slow horse, but you're stuck with the same runspeed throughout the game (exception is temporary buff in dungeon).
- read in forums automation doesnt give you workshop exp
- animals seemed like an afterthought since those buildings are maxed at lv 1, otherwise is a decent choice for extra side income
- thrown items were meh, and you cant use them to mine ores
- hard to build relationship pts with kids or animals since they dont post commissions so with animals you can only talk and gift once a day, (with kids you can also play critters)
- non essential npc's have nothing better to say other than ""...""
- va for musa is also a soldier.

things i did like:
- items from storage can be used to turn in items for quests
- good variety of characters/memorable personalities, but then there's people like jensen who has no backstory
- get to see how your projects build sandrock up, enjoyed the story and how it related to the last game
- ranged weapons are a pretty cheesy way of beating combat content 
- melee combat was good for a game not focused on combat
- enough perks to make more gol, make friends faster, make stuff faster, etc
- steam achievements are not difficult to achieve, but some are somewhat grindy unless you plan ahead. i think roughly 140hrs until i get 100%.
- you can go to options menu to speed up or slow down the game at leisure 0.6-3x so waiting for time related events doesnt take forever.

some bugs but nothing gamebreaking, if fixed then solid 9/10 otherwise 8/10.",9102,Game Portia Minor Spoilers List Bugs Encountered Playing Characters Stuck Exit Building Climb Cliff Mama Tree Fall Cliff Desert Stuck Abyss Mission Slow Debuff 0Sec Duration Remains Mission Spam Roll Dungeon Slow Poison Debuff 0 Permanent Died Reloaded Loading Screen Entering House Lost 20 30Mins Progress Autosaves Saved Day Handed Medal Pose Receiving Medal Semi Transparent Invisible Mounting Horse Dismounting Mounts Npcs Constantly Teleport Catch Dialogue Fade Wind Married Amirah Party Festivals Attend Party Built Sand Buggy Assembly Station Literally Invisible House Pet Stuck Walls House Bumble Ants Walk Walls Property Bad Pathing Enemies Spawn Game Progression Civil Commissions Posted Wipe Couple Instances Commissions Posted Create Item Resources Farmed Access List Stuff Relic Pieces Spend Time Sorting Storage Box Duplicates Multiple Storage Boxes Duplicate Multiple Boxes Max Backpack Space Lot Maxing Items Gifts Hand 100 Steam Achievements Reasonable Time Talk Gift Day 1 Social Exp Grind Weapon Perks Unbalanced Pick Slow Burn Poison Chance Hit Raw Crit Build Crit Dmg Crit Chance Lifedrain Track Items Donated Museum Manually Track Spreadsheet Guide Forums Npc Steal Kill Enemy Registered Bestiary Enemy Boss Enemy Spawns Glhf Exp Npc Fast Slow Horse Stuck Runspeed Game Exception Temporary Buff Dungeon Read Forums Automation Workshop Exp Animals Afterthought Buildings Maxed 1 Decent Choice Extra Income Thrown Items Meh Ores Hard Build Relationship Pts Kids Animals Post Commissions Animals Talk Gift Day Kids Play Critters Essential Npc Musa Soldier Items Storage Items Quests Variety Characters Memorable Personalities People Jensen Backstory Projects Build Sandrock Enjoyed Story Game Ranged Weapons Pretty Cheesy Beating Combat Content Melee Combat Game Focused Combat Perks Gol Friends Faster Stuff Faster Steam Achievements Difficult Achieve Grindy Plan Roughly 140Hrs 100 Options Menu Speed Slow Game Leisure 0 6 3X Waiting Time Events Bugs Gamebreaking Fixed Solid 9 8,POSITIVE,1,0,76,10,0.8837209302325582
2023-11-25,"this game started off so well, really seeming to be portia but better. but the more i play it, the more issues i'm having. i've got a lot of unconnected thoughts, so i'll list the good and bad then put a summary at the botom.

[b]good:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]oustanding character design, personality, and development.[/b]
seriously some of the most lovable npcs in gaming. everyone has a unique and very well developed personality, with their own backstories and character arc.
[*][b]interesting world with a great concept to base the game off of.[/b]
sandrock has a well thought out history, and you have the goal of showing up while it's getting run down and on the decline, and having to turn it around to make it prosper. you do this by building new things to make the town grow, by uncovering lost technology from the old world long destroyed by the day of the calamity, and by fighting off the growing desert.
[*][b]lots to do.[/b]
farm, build, grow your workshop, decorate, connect with the townspeople, play minigames, catch fish, explore ruins, fight monsters etc. you know what to expect from games like this, and this game manages to include a wide variety of content better than most.
[*][b]humour.[/b]
there's a lot of funny jokes, silliness, nice references, and all sorts that will make you smile.
[*][b]coziness.[/b]
the game is so damn pleasant. there's so many issues with it which i'll get to, but despite them all i still found myself having a great time up until towards the end. it's just such a nice world to be in, it's so lovely learning about all the characters and gradually improving the town and your own workshop. it's really nice.
[*][b]immersion.[/b]
bit of a weird one, but this is something this game does well i think. you can get so absorbed and lost in this world. i love games that have the ability to make me forget the real world and just live in this virtual one for a week or two. this game nailed that. the fact i have 130 hours played after only starting 12 days ago shows what i mean, lol.
[/list]


[b]bad:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]performance.[/b]
the game takes a solid 5-10 minutes to load. this is a constant issue. going from one place to another has a very long loading screen, and even when it finishes loading, very few entities have actually loaded. buildings, menus, npcs, and objects all take an extra minute or so to load. sometimes they just don't load at all, and you'll have to restart the game. i've never had so much issues with load times in a game.
[*][b]the game is extremely grindy and tedious.[/b]
i'm 130 hours in and not even made it halfway towards finishing some things. i'm not exaggerating. i'm still not even done with the story, and from what the achievements tell me, neither are 99% of the people playing the game. collecting resources is extremely repetitive and slow, so is crafting, so is befriending people, and fighting, and pretty much every aspect of the game. everything is painfully longwinded and drawn out, taking a ridiculously long time for little payoff.
[*][b]length.[/b]
i'm never one to complain about how long a game is, the more there is to do the happier i am. this game is the one exception to that. all the story points feel so disjointed. it could end at so many points, but it has to add a new twist or an entirely new and unrelated story every time, which adds an extra 30 hours to the game each time. why has the story gone from developing this town, to catching a bandit, to [spoilers]rescuing a rat princess, to fighting in a war[/spoilers]. it strays so so far from the starting point that it's hard to stay interested, and that brings me to my next point.
[*][b]story.[/b]
it starts off so good, but what on earth happened. at some point you need to stop and question if what you're doing makes sense, and this game just doesn't. the game throws plot twist after plot twist at you, without putting much thought into any of them. none of them make sense, none of them are good ideas, it just feels like it's elongating this already immensely long game for no actual benefit.
[*][b]quality.[/b]
the game is very janky, which i personally think is fine for the most part, but it's worth mentioning. combat has you zipping around erratically, you can walk up almost vertical walls, mounts controls awfully, camera movement during dialogue is very strange, every cutscene is broken if there's a sandstorm going on, sandstorms don't actually do anything, there are almost no quality of life features, lots of invisible walls, there's not much attention to detail, and many features of the game feel very barebones. there's a lot more i could mention but this is already too long. the game just feels very much like they set their ambitions higher than they're able to reach. the fact i've got myself softlocked twice, and just downloaded a week 2 update which fixes 90+ bugs says a lot about the game. it just isn't well made.
[*][b]multiplayer[/b]
when this game was announced, it was planned to have multiplayer. not long before the release of the game, they decided to change that, after already receiving backing and early access purchases from people who were promised the game would have multiplayer. the game now has the most barebones and pointless multiplayer you can ask for, with no story or any of what makes the game fun.
[/list]

to summarise, this game has so much potential. it's a lovely idea, with some elements like character development and world building done remarkably well. however, the poor quality of the game, slow detioration of the story, and incredibly monotonous gameplay results in a very mediocre overall experience.",11769,Game Started Portia Play Issues Lot Unconnected List Bad Summary Botom List Oustanding Character Design Personality Development Lovable Npcs Gaming Unique Developed Personality Backstories Character Arc Concept Base Game Sandrock History Goal Decline Prosper Building Town Grow Uncovering Lost Technology Destroyed Day Calamity Fighting Growing Desert Lots Farm Build Grow Workshop Decorate Connect Townspeople Play Minigames Catch Fish Explore Ruins Fight Monsters Expect Games Game Manages Include Wide Variety Content Humour Lot Funny Jokes Silliness Nice References Sorts Smile Coziness Game Damn Pleasant Issues Time Nice Lovely Learning Characters Gradually Improving Town Workshop Nice Immersion Bit Weird Game Absorbed Lost Love Games Ability Forget Real Live Virtual Week Game Nailed 130 Hours Played Starting 12 Days Lol List Bad List Performance Game Takes Solid 5 Minutes Load Constant Issue Loading Screen Finishes Loading Entities Loaded Buildings Menus Npcs Objects Extra Minute Load Load Restart Game Issues Load Times Game Game Extremely Grindy Tedious 130 Hours Halfway Finishing Exaggerating Story Achievements 99 People Playing Game Collecting Resources Extremely Repetitive Slow Crafting Befriending People Fighting Pretty Aspect Game Painfully Longwinded Drawn Ridiculously Time Payoff Complain Game Happier Game Exception Story Feel Disjointed Add Twist Unrelated Story Time Adds Extra 30 Hours Game Time Story Developing Town Catching Bandit Spoilers Rescuing Rat Princess Fighting War Spoilers Strays Starting Hard Stay Brings Story Starts Earth Happened Question Sense Game Game Throws Plot Twist Plot Twist Putting Sense Ideas Feels Elongating Immensely Game Actual Benefit Quality Game Janky Personally Fine Worth Mentioning Combat Zipping Erratically Walk Vertical Walls Mounts Controls Camera Movement Dialogue Strange Cutscene Broken Sandstorm Sandstorms Quality Life Features Lots Invisible Walls Attention Features Game Feel Barebones Lot Mention Game Feels Set Ambitions Reach Softlocked Downloaded Week 2 Update Fixes 90 Bugs Lot Game Multiplayer Game Announced Planned Multiplayer Release Game Decided Change Receiving Access Purchases People Promised Game Multiplayer Game Barebones Pointless Multiplayer Story Game Fun List Summarise Game Potential Lovely Idea Elements Character Development Building Remarkably Poor Quality Game Slow Detioration Story Incredibly Monotonous Gameplay Mediocre Experience,POSITIVE,1,0,82,9,0.9010989010989011
2023-11-24,"[h2]ahoy![/h2]

this be ye local piratical reviewer comin' to tell ye if my time at sandrock be worth your precious doubloons or whether she be sent down to the briny depths!

i want to tell ye first, i've played the predecessor my time at portia to completin' and will be makin' some comparisons between 'em, i'll also be splittin' me thoughts into ayes 'n nays for easy readin'

[h3]ayes[/h3]

[b]a real sense o' progression[/b]
my time at sandrock (mtas) nails that sense of progression that my time at portia (mtap) pioneered. as ye be making ye adventures, ye'll be changing sandrock, from buildin' cranes te' fixing the hydrogel, expanding the yakmel network to more serious ventures like plantin' forests in the desert and building the road to portia. 

for each quest chain ye complete, you'll get reminders just how far ye've came. making ye feel apart of the world, and ultimately it's my most favourite draw to mtas.

[b]craftin'[/b]
goin' hand in hand with makin' ye changes in sandrock, the crafting is an improvement upon mtap. ye have a bounty o' machines to be gettin' ye buildin. most days ye'll be havin' machines runnin' all day pumpin out manner o things for ye designs. ingots, screws, slabs, everything to be gettin' everythin' built. occasionally, you'll feel overwhelmed but honestly, i felt that it feed it the hectic job that is bein' a builder in mtas. ye'll eventually condense this into ye crown jewel near the end, the almighty factory.

[b]exploration[/b]
the world of sandrock is huge and thar be plenty to see and dive. you'll be prowlin' through dangerous ruins, fighting robots and mobs for parts ye need for your builds and ye'll be spendin' a fair chunk o' ye time in the abandoned ruins, bringin' up various ores and relics to both smelt and reassemble. i've got no complaints.

[b]the characters[/b]
in this pirates honest opinions, the characters in mtas shine far brighter then those in portia. every character has a small chain that details there daily lives and a insight to their personality. it added that depth to life and some reason to care about the characters compared to portia, the massively expanded amount of quests featured in mtas, really helped in this situation.

[h3]nays[/h3]

[b]combat[/b]
thar has been a' few changes to combat, however, it still be simplistic. you'll be finding yourself usin' the same strategies ye found in portia. ye'll be dodging the choreographed events, going in to break' em and then just devastating 'em. it's the same ole' song and dance. it be worse with guns, ye'll whip your pistol o' rifle and just stun lock and break your enemy in place, making short work out most o' everything. disappointin' really.

[b]performance[/b]
this be nay gay breakin' but ye'll certainly notice it in ye adventurin'. mtas doesn't play aswell as portia, ye have pop in galore, especially o' anything ye've added to the world via the quests. the game chugs in the town itself and has random slow downs in various places. it can detract from ye' experience.

the small positive is for me, is that the game has mostly been light on bugs and pathea has been on the ball since release. 

[b]dlc practices[/b]
i hated to be addin' this one but £4.49 for costumes for 4 characters and putting the favourites separate in individual packs is a practice that belongs in davey jones locker. either bundle them together for a tenner or reduce the price of the individuals. currently it looks a cash grab and add as a tarnish to this shining treasure.

[h3]conclusion n' scoring[/h3]
mtas is a large game and it's hard to condense everything inte' a few paragraphs. it's a massive improvement on mtap. if ye loved that game, ye'll be right at home here. a no brainer for ye doubloons.

if ye the kind of sailor that loves a solid sense o' progression with an in-depth crafting system, memorable characters and a massive chain of quests to go on and doesn't mind some minor annoyances and lacklustre combat system. ye'll definitely find some good sailing 'ere.

i give mtas a solid 8.5/10 gold doubloons. a massive improvement over portia if not marred by spotty performance and cheap dlc tactics.",9744,H2 Ahoy H2 Local Piratical Reviewer Comin Time Sandrock Worth Precious Doubloons Briny Depths Played Predecessor Time Portia Completin Makin Comparisons Em Splittin Ayes Nays Easy Readin H3 Ayes H3 Real Sense Progression Time Sandrock Mtas Nails Sense Progression Time Portia Mtap Pioneered Adventures Changing Sandrock Buildin Cranes Te Fixing Hydrogel Expanding Yakmel Network Ventures Plantin Forests Desert Building Road Portia Quest Chain Complete Reminders Feel Ultimately Favourite Draw Mtas Craftin Goin Hand Hand Makin Sandrock Crafting Improvement Mtap Bounty Machines Gettin Buildin Days Havin Machines Runnin Day Pumpin Manner Designs Ingots Screws Slabs Gettin Everythin Built Occasionally Feel Overwhelmed Honestly Feed Hectic Job Bein Builder Mtas Eventually Condense Crown Jewel Almighty Factory Exploration Sandrock Huge Thar Plenty Dive Prowlin Dangerous Ruins Fighting Robots Mobs Builds Spendin Fair Chunk Time Abandoned Ruins Bringin Ores Relics Smelt Reassemble Complaints Characters Pirates Honest Opinions Characters Mtas Shine Brighter Portia Character Chain Details Daily Lives Insight Personality Depth Life Reason Care Characters Compared Portia Massively Expanded Quests Featured Mtas Helped Situation H3 Nays H3 Combat Thar Combat Simplistic Finding Usin Strategies Portia Dodging Choreographed Events Break Em Devastating Em Ole Song Dance Worse Guns Whip Pistol Rifle Stun Lock Break Enemy Short Disappointin Performance Gay Breakin Notice Adventurin Mtas Play Aswell Portia Pop Galore Quests Game Chugs Town Random Slow Detract Experience Positive Game Light Bugs Pathea Ball Release Dlc Practices Hated Addin 4 49 Costumes 4 Characters Putting Favourites Separate Individual Packs Practice Belongs Davey Jones Locker Bundle Tenner Reduce Price Individuals Cash Grab Add Tarnish Shining Treasure H3 Conclusion Scoring H3 Mtas Game Hard Condense Inte Paragraphs Massive Improvement Mtap Loved Game Brainer Doubloons Sailor Loves Solid Sense Progression Depth Crafting Memorable Characters Massive Chain Quests Mind Minor Annoyances Lacklustre Combat Sailing Ere Mtas Solid 8 5 Gold Doubloons Massive Improvement Portia Marred Spotty Performance Cheap Dlc Tactics,POSITIVE,1,0,139,6,0.9586206896551724

2023-11-23,"one of my favorite games of all time. has the most complex social aspects i've seen in a game and what we usually all wanted for years with life sim games. other devs should take notes, honestly. 

the best part about this game: there is always plenty things to do, and they are all fun and useful, a lot of life sim games might have you build useless things. almost everything you build gets used in events, main story content, bridges to unlock new areas, oh, and there is always new places being unlocked as you progress, immersive atmosphere, new characters being introduced, and i mean years in-game. 408 hrs (continued from early access save) and i am still unlocking new characters, areas, story content.

all the characters are well voice and well written. and by well written---really, well written. i don't think i can play a harvest moon or story of seasons game after this tbh. it's spoiled me. the characters are fleshed out wonderfully, with their own thought out pasts, stories, you can talk about them in convo during play dates, or romantic ones. some characters have reverse confessions and characters have romance and friendship quests as well as multiple in story quests where other characters will talk and interact with you and eachother. i guarantee you will feel some emotion for every single one of these characters. characters i didn't like or care about before i got to know i grew to like later, their flaws and their traits both, and their stories. 

this is one of the most immersive games i've experienced. it makes you feel apart of the community, and the seratonin boosts you get just from speaking to villagers, getting gifts outside your house on your birthday or wedding day, having your partner ask if you'd like to spend the day together after marriage and take you on little dates when most games are like 'they are married, have kids' and it's either the end, or they are blank nobodies now that have no more content whatsoever! this game doesn't do that. 

if sandrock gets more content dlc or in the next my time game, if they decide to have a kid system, i'd rather no kids unless there is real content for them, this is what the people want pathea, even if you charge $ for it:

-family outings/content and story events with your child/partner, and with the townsfolk
-the child going to school/interacting with other children
-old enough to speak properly/help out around the work shop or be interested in another profession/maybe story content for the kid following qi or owen around if they wanted to work as a scientist apprentice/at the blue moon as a chef or waiter or something.  ((not neccessary, just would be super cute. i would just rather not have kids in a game, like how stardew did unless they have content, sandrock still beat the others for sure though.)) and maybe a better child system to know when your child needs something/bring them with you on a baby backpack or hire a babysitter if you can't be home.

i'm definitely doing another playthrough. it's easy to miss dialogue and content because there is so much((this is a good thing.)) we got so lucky with my time at sandrock and i feel like i would 100% die for any of the sandrockers fr. the story gets better and better. sometimes it's silly, sometimes it's serious, sometimes it's just fun. 

characters you befriend will someetimes show up outside your house because they miss you and want to hang out, and sometimes you will see a lot of ! events to unlock, where you can say to much is going on right now and get to it later.

you might walk into someones home and they are eating dinner together, arvios sister is visiting him, or the preacher is teaching jasmine how to speak politely if she didn't like an authors book. little details that bring life

oh, and don't get me started on the holidays. only game i cared about holidays. you have mini games on almost every one, from collecting ingredients on a yakmel and can bump into other people, grilling up food for the towns folk, a dance competition, and so much more.

on dates with friends and romantically, you can set off fireworks in a fun pattern of your choosing, draw in the sand, play whack a mole or games at the arcade, sit and talk on a bench or go out to eat and order them food. you can befriend folks easily without gift spamming. talking to them, being yourself and taking commissions/work on the request or commission board they asked for is helpful. some characters might need to unlock events to get there story or even be able to give gifts to them if they are more to themselves.

the personalities are well thought out. characters with pasts, multiple hobbies likes and dislikes, where most games the 'fisherman' is just a fisherman and nothing more, his entire personality. you will hear them talk about their family, their other interests, and things they like. the characters entire personality isnt just a trope or based around 1 thing. this is the best character development as well for some characters i've seen in a long time. i highly reccomend buying this. it will be a blast constantly.

2023-11-23,"i don't leave reviews often so let me explain why i am this time first then i'll talk about sandrock.  back in 2014 i bought pathea's (first?  think so?) game called planet explorers.  i loved it at first but it had such a long development then in 2016 they ""full released"" the game, all while i still encountered game breaking bugs in the first 10min of gameplay that i had when i first started the game in '14.  coming off of also getting burned on several other steam greenlight games (yall remember that s**t?!), i swore that i would never, ever, buy another pathea game again..... then in 2018 i saw this cute game pop up in my feed called my time at portia, i was immediately in love with the art style and premise of the game and bought immediately, somehow missing the pathea logos and name the entire time.  by the time i realized that they were made by the same devs i had like some 100+hrs in portia and exhausted all the content even available at the time.  i did become a bit doomer and just awaited it to just disappear into history as another abandoned game.... well i have 300+ hours in portia now and it ranks as one of my favorite games of all time.  so firstly, i want to thank pathea games for doing a complete flip in my book and coming out with absolute bangers that have lost me many hours in workshop (my real one not the one in game, that workshop gets overused!)

now, lets talk about sandrock specifically (no story spoilers dont worry).  i had no idea it was even coming until it was too late to even back it on kickstarted and i hated myself for it!  i mean look at sandrock!  it has everything i love portia and then just completely redid it or made it even better.  the art style is such a nice thing to look at, the animations feel so much more complete and the gameplay feels nice and balanced and gives you full freedom to play how you will with very little in the way of forcing progress except when you really want to.  don't wanna go ultra super heavy into making your workshop mega and just wanna socialize?  you got it!  or you can do what i do and take #1 builder before the first month is even over (suck it yan!). the characters are all so lovable or just absolutely memorable to me, pen is such a over the top dude, yan while being your main 'rival' doesn't like actively take commissions from you like higgins did (no more sprinting off to the guild to grab the good commissions before he does), and miguel as much as i don't like him like him i at least have an understanding of him and even at times sympathize with his views.  i was put off at first by how you get more resources from recyclers rather than just straight gather (which there is still plenty of!) but in time i grew to really enjoy that i could have all them crunching for copper while i go get iron.  everything about it feels so well thought and improved from portia while not feeling like they just ctrl+c ctrl+v.  while it does get tedious at first managing both water and fuel for machines it became second nature when i run over to machine to start new production to just auto fill with dregs and i rarely had an issue anymore of machine out of water/fuel(by the way never ever use your wood for fuel just go slap some powerstones or get some dregs, thank me later).  the greatest improvement imo is combat which feels leagues ahead of the combat i remember from portia and i actually like dungeon diving now (before it was more ugh ok i guess ill go...).  socializing also feels alot easier in this game, admittedly i tend to always put socializing on the back burner but in my now post release game everyone loves me.  the one thing i really complained about was it felt like i had not enough time to do everything i wanted because i had to run here or there to get things done but that got solved when i found the time slider, won't really help you crunch resources faster since those are timed to in game time, but it's easier to run home and start something to turn in a com without running out of time due to me spending time walking, i found that a .67 time setting to be a nice sweet spot for getting places without dragging a day too long.  

and on the story itself, again, no spoilers, but it's good, really good imo.  it kept me hooked and interested the whole way, and also laughing because this game doesn't try to make everything so serious even in the more serious parts of the game (there's always a punch line xd). i got so excited in the last major update before release that i couldn't help myself but again play all through the twist and turns of what i think is the climax of the game (haven't full played on release yet so idk if theres even more after that!) and even after completing it i didn't feel like i was done or satisfied, there was still more work to do, still more commissions to get and more to build and to get sandrock back to its former glory (and even better!).  before release, i had just shy of 300hrs in sandrock and in the past 2 weeks, even with my bloated work schedule these days ive blown 80hrs in my new playthough and i can definately see myself blowing another 300 on this game before i get 'tired' of it. 

the tldr of it is, yes, buy this game.  you'll love it, play how you want to play, don't get the biggest baddest workshop if you dont want to, dont socialize alot if you dont want to.  or do!  sit back, relax, take a load off your mind and just create and have fun or go full try hard and show that yan dude whose the real newbie.  and pathea, from the just in my opinion let down of planet explorers, you have my eternal gratitude for portia and sandrock and you have won me fully back and just eager for the day the next my time at x game comes out (highwind!? altara? i mean coooommmmee ooooonnnn!!!)

2023-11-23,"[h1]i liked it.[/h1]
i liked portia, and i liked this game. just finished it! lots to do, the story is much more significant than i expected. thumbs up.

...with caveats. i had hoped that this time around we'd be able to avoid some of the pitfalls that portia had, and there were exotic new pitfalls to enjoy as well.

[h2]spoilers ahead, sorry. skip to conclusion for non-spoilery assessment[/h2]

[h3]the good[/h3]
[list]
[*]unsuur
[*]lots of story content, more than portia
[*]you get to feel epic as the townies come to respect you
[*]the civil corps of sandrock acknowledges you as an honorary member instead of pretending for the entire game that they are stronger than you in spite of your combat prowess like the civil corps of portia did
[*]didn't rely pretty much at all on any of the old workshop machines from the old game, and new models where there was overlap
[*]had a much more effective environmental message, where portia kind of deliberately put you at odds with the environmentalists in the game while trying to talk about the importance of environmentalism
[*]some (some) of the voice acting was pretty good
[*]i liked the weapon variety and specialization you could do through knowledge points
[*]did a decent job of making it so you could stop hunting for older, low-level ore and minerals while still making you track down new ores and occasional rarities like engines and stuff.
[*]datable men in this game are way hotter than in portia. so are the women, but the glow-up award goes to the guys. much better fleshed out personalities across the board too.
[*]i really liked hanging out and dating being instant instead of scheduled for a specific time the next day.
[/list]

[h3]the bad[/h3]
[list]
[*]arvio
[*]nearly every model that's not a permanent feature of the landscape takes a long time to load in
[*]quite a bit of the voice acting and sound design is somewhere between questionable and bad
[*]pacing is often weird. see section below.
[*]dating and hanging out still isn't fun
[*]there is no contest whatsoever in the builder rankings. i beat yan in year one without trouble, and in year two mi-an didn't come close. i could have done just one commission a day and i still would have been miles ahead. i expected mi-an to surge ahead to at least claim some yan-level numbers once yan wasn't taking credit for all her work, but she just wasn't remotely a threat.
[*]there was not nearly enough variety in the commissions. never-ending metal ingots, metal plates, stone slabs, petrified wood planks and sticks, and canvas were my reward for climbing to five stars. why aren't people commissioning more, you know... built stuff?
[*]what the hell happened to the factory? in portia it had an awesome animated interior and dedicated upgrade options. in sandrock it's an ugly living room with all your machines crammed into it as cramped as you can manage. in portia it worked with the automated half of your assembly station, but in sandrock you wish you could just delete your assembly station entirely because you'll never use it again.
[*]i never once used a powerstone of either grade. i found it impossible to run out of dregs.
[*]i love merle, but i wanted a goat with rambo's horns.
[*]there's a whole upgrade in the abandoned ruins goggles to let you see the outline of the items you scan. only problem is every scannable item is smaller than the diamond indicator so you'll never actually see the outline of anything. portia had no such issue.
[*]sandrock fails in multiple instances to teach you about functions of the game. i never once learned to use a camera, so i had a whopping zero photos at the end of the game. i was made aware of the existence of parties thanks to the resources i had to make them go over well, but i only learned from the end credits that i was supposed to purchase and set up a banquet table to unlock this feature. i discovered that many of the datable npcs have outfit options in the social menu. i never found out how to make those happen. the fashion show seemed like the time for that to unlock, but the outfits were never made purchaseable, despite barber guy's enthusiasm about selling them in his dialogue. i thought maybe it was dlc, but it turns out it's not, so how was that meant to unlock? maybe after you marry them? nope. still no idea.
[*]i gave grace a custom pet name to call me when we got married. she just called me sugar instead.
[*]i am genuinely unsure if there are enough small items to donate to the museum to successfully fill the small item slots available
[*]the house builder interface is janky as hell. sometimes you just have to quit and go back in to get anything done as various items refuse to bring up their interaction options, become unmovable, become unresizable, or just plain disappear because of an errant click. was it a workshop machine? then don't bother checking your inventory or the ""workshop machine"" menu on the builder interface, because it's now in your mailbox. so better get your ass back home to get that item and then head back to the house builder thing to try and remember what you were doing.
[/list]

pacing issues
[list]
[*]i earned a greenhouse before i was ever able to develop a single tile of biocrust naturally, despite nonstop gardening starting the moment gardening was available. even without the greenhouse, the main story gifted me enough biocrust to make generating it manually a pointless feature.
[*]i was excited to get my max-level spear, but i earned the laser sword before i could make one and it was the indisputable optimal choice, rendering my knowledge points in spears worthless
[*]in portia the final build, a plane, blindsides you with a sudden need for truckloads of crystals you never thought to harvest before and makes you take in-game weeks just waiting for them to spawn so you can finish the quest. sandrock's elegant answer to this problem is to make the final build embarrassingly easy to complete. you'll probably have it finished in an afternoon with materials you had laying around. please, by all means, send me on a couple days of fetching to get the parts i need for this once-in-a-game build. they're never going to ask for another one, so make them unique items that i need to fight some boss monsters to obtain or something. i don't know, but ""a single expedition's worth of nanomaterial scrap and poplar wood and (checks notes) an item made a tiny amount of copper and bronze"" can't possibly be the best answer.
[*]in both portia and sandrock, the factory is a double-edged sword. it feels awesome to unlock godmode in your workshop, but you'll never have to think meaningfully about any commissions or build quests again. that's the day you go from bustling builder to rare material scavenger, and there's no going back, really. it was also too cheap and easy to have a factory in this game. couple grand, you're good to go. at least in portia you had to gather a mess of expensive materials and pony up the cash.
[*]you'll have the max-level workshop equipment by about the halfway point of the game. upgrading feels nice, so it's sad when this goes away so soon.
[/list]

[h3]conclusion[/h3]
this is a fundamentally fun game that, like its predecessor, is deeply flawed. it has heart, but it feels unfinished in a way i know they're not going to fix. i had hoped portia would serve as a learning experience that would lead to sandrock being far more optimized out the gate. instead, it's genuinely unclear if they learned much of anything from portia's issues.

would i buy a new entry in this series in the future? well... probably. because they did at least prove they have some fun new ideas that do iterate successfully on the ""my time at"" formula. but at this point pathea is cementing itself in my head as a studio with a lot of muscle in the ideas department, but anemic in the polish department. the public is growing weary of studios that can't release a finished game.",9123,H1 H1 Portia Game Finished Lots Story Expected Thumbs Caveats Hoped Time Avoid Pitfalls Portia Exotic Pitfalls Enjoy H2 Spoilers Skip Conclusion Spoilery Assessment H2 H3 H3 List Unsuur Lots Story Content Portia Feel Epic Townies Respect Civil Corps Sandrock Acknowledges Honorary Pretending Entire Game Stronger Spite Combat Prowess Civil Corps Portia Rely Pretty Workshop Machines Game Models Overlap Effective Environmental Message Portia Deliberately Odds Environmentalists Game Talk Environmentalism Voice Acting Pretty Weapon Variety Specialization Knowledge Decent Job Hunting Level Ore Minerals Track Ores Occasional Rarities Engines Stuff Datable Game Hotter Portia Women Glow Award Guys Fleshed Personalities Board Hanging Dating Instant Scheduled Specific Time Day List H3 Bad H3 List Arvio Model Permanent Feature Landscape Takes Time Load Bit Voice Acting Sound Design Questionable Bad Pacing Weird Dating Hanging Fun Contest Whatsoever Builder Rankings Beat Yan Trouble Mi Close Commission Day Miles Expected Mi Surge Claim Yan Level Yan Credit Remotely Threat Variety Commissions Metal Ingots Metal Plates Stone Slabs Petrified Wood Planks Sticks Canvas Reward Climbing Stars People Commissioning Built Stuff Happened Factory Portia Awesome Animated Interior Dedicated Upgrade Options Sandrock Ugly Living Machines Crammed Cramped Manage Portia Automated Assembly Station Sandrock Delete Assembly Station Powerstone Grade Impossible Dregs Love Merle Goat Rambo Horns Upgrade Abandoned Ruins Goggles Outline Items Scan Scannable Item Diamond Indicator Outline Portia Issue Sandrock Fails Multiple Instances Teach Functions Game Learned Camera Whopping Photos Game Aware Existence Parties Resources Learned Credits Supposed Purchase Set Banquet Table Unlock Feature Discovered Datable Npcs Outfit Options Social Menu Happen Fashion Time Unlock Outfits Purchaseable Barber Guy Enthusiasm Selling Dialogue Dlc Meant Unlock Marry Nope Idea Grace Custom Pet Married Called Sugar Genuinely Unsure Items Donate Museum Item Slots House Builder Interface Janky Quit Items Refuse Bring Interaction Options Unmovable Unresizable Plain Disappear Errant Workshop Machine Bother Checking Inventory Workshop Machine Menu Builder Interface Mailbox Ass Item Head House Builder Remember List Pacing Issues List Earned Greenhouse Develop Single Tile Biocrust Naturally Nonstop Gardening Starting Moment Gardening Greenhouse Main Story Gifted Biocrust Generating Manually Pointless Feature Excited Max Level Spear Earned Laser Sword Indisputable Optimal Choice Rendering Knowledge Spears Worthless Portia Final Build Plane Blindsides Sudden Truckloads Crystals Harvest Game Weeks Waiting Spawn Finish Quest Sandrock Elegant Answer Final Build Embarrassingly Easy Complete Finished Afternoon Materials Laying Send Couple Days Fetching Game Build Unique Items Fight Boss Monsters Single Expedition Worth Nanomaterial Scrap Poplar Wood Checks Notes Item Tiny Copper Bronze Answer Portia Sandrock Factory Double Edged Sword Feels Awesome Unlock Godmode Workshop Meaningfully Commissions Build Quests Day Bustling Builder Rare Material Scavenger Cheap Easy Factory Game Couple Grand Portia Gather Mess Expensive Materials Pony Cash Max Level Workshop Equipment Halfway Game Upgrading Feels Nice Sad List H3 Conclusion H3 Fundamentally Fun Game Predecessor Deeply Flawed Heart Feels Unfinished Hoped Portia Serve Learning Experience Lead Sandrock Optimized Gate Genuinely Unclear Learned Portia Issues Entry Series Future Prove Fun Ideas Iterate Time Formula Pathea Cementing Head Studio Lot Muscle Ideas Department Anemic Polish Department Public Growing Weary Studios Release Finished Game,POSITIVE,1,0,147,16,0.901840490797546
2023-11-22,"mtas is, from the get-go, very similar to its predecessor my time at portia and for the most part that holds true as this was supposed to be an expansion before turning into a separate project.

does it separate itself enough to warrant a separate purchase? i believe so, although i believe the price increased since early access when i purchased it.

initially i was put off by the chosen setting as having a farming game be set in a desolate desert setting seemed like a tall order but the developers managed to introduce new mechanics to account for this without removing one of the core parts of the original game. i will not go into detail as some of these mechanics are also tied to the story which is appreciated as well. they may seem a bit tedious at the beginning but eventually as with the previous games most of the energy/water requirements become trivial from simply farming out other resources which i find to be nice as the game is already pretty grindy as its predecessor was in some aspects. a quick tip: do try to get a pet asap as they help a ton.
how grindy the game feels however depends on what you as the player would like to do and how stressed you feel about worker of the month/year nominations. if you want to keep ahead you will be farming 3-4 commissions daily as well as blowing all your stamina in abandoned ruins which can become a bit of a repetitive chore (for me this feeling started somewhere around winter 1st year). in order to avoid this i would recommend engaging with other parts of the game as well (hangouts/romance/building the house/farm) and not feeling like you need to squeeze out every ounce of stamina out of every day otherwise you will burn out quickly.

in terms of the story i still have not reached the complete conclusion but i believe nobody expected this game to bring out a game of the year contender in this regard.
if there is one thing however i would say that the pacing feels off for me. lot of the progression is gated by arbitrary amounts of days that have to pass in order for you to even receive an email that will tell you (at the beginning of a given day) that the story will continue 2 days from now. after those 2 days pass you usually go to a fireside meeting where they will say something usually followed by another day or 2 of waiting which became a real point of frustration as i already blew through all the mining/building content and needed story to progress to access the 3rd abandoned ruins which never seem to come. at this point i am in year 2 spring and i have been done with all that 2nd abandoned ruins offer in year 1 day 26 autumn which means i spent most of winter just running around hoping a side-quest would appear or the story would hurry up and come but it never did as from what i read i am still a few mysterious letters off from actually getting to the ruins. feels like i am being drip fed story at this point which would be fine if i was not done with everything i can do in a given day at about 3pm with plenty of time to spare.

hangouts/romance are pretty similar to what they were in portia but i appreciate the variety of characters that are available although i do miss papa bear. i thought sandy was going to be a nice replacement for papa bear for me but the sound that camel makes evoke some primordial feelings of horror in me so i avoid her usually.
one thing that i find odd is how easy it is to become a bff with heidi specifically since many of the commissions are from her so even if i do not really care about her she is my best friend stat-wise since avoiding her commissions would be hamstringing my progress too much. of course with addition of a bounty board this levels out a bit as those requests (at least in my experience) came from a variety of characters usually not requesting standard commissions like elsie for example who in my play-through appeared on standard commission board maybe twice with a incredibly simple request that yields almost no rewards.

all in all it might seem like i am airing my grievances with the game which is true but i still really like it for what it is. it may not be perfect owing to the points above or the bugs which still plague it but i do believe it is a great experience for people who liked the first game and builds upon it well. the grind feels satisfying when done in moderation and there are a lot of options for customizing your yard and house. romance options are plenty and compared to the first game there seem to be more post-marriage content.
i do hope future brings more bugfixes and even content if we should be so lucky.

p.s.
if a sequel ever comes i do hope for a different environment though as portia was also 1/3 if not 1/2 desert which i understand is a rather major plot point in the overall story but i am kind of over sand now, thanks.",9290,Mtas Predecessor Time Portia Holds True Supposed Expansion Separate Project Separate Warrant Separate Purchase Price Increased Access Purchased Initially Chosen Setting Farming Game Set Desolate Desert Setting Tall Developers Managed Introduce Mechanics Account Removing Core Original Game Mechanics Tied Story Appreciated Bit Tedious Eventually Previous Games Energy Water Requirements Trivial Simply Farming Resources Nice Game Pretty Grindy Predecessor Aspects Quick Pet Asap Ton Grindy Game Feels Depends Player Stressed Feel Worker Month Nominations Farming 3 4 Commissions Daily Blowing Stamina Abandoned Ruins Bit Repetitive Chore Feeling Started Winter 1St Avoid Recommend Engaging Game Hangouts Romance Building House Farm Feeling Squeeze Ounce Stamina Day Burn Terms Story Reached Complete Conclusion Expected Game Bring Game Contender Regard Pacing Feels Lot Progression Gated Arbitrary Amounts Days Pass Receive Email Day Story Continue 2 Days 2 Days Pass Fireside Meeting Day 2 Waiting Real Frustration Blew Mining Building Content Story Progress Access 3Rd Abandoned Ruins 2 Spring 2Nd Abandoned Ruins Offer 1 Day 26 Autumn Spent Winter Running Hoping Quest Story Hurry Read Mysterious Letters Ruins Feels Drip Fed Story Fine Day 3Pm Plenty Time Spare Hangouts Romance Pretty Portia Variety Characters Papa Bear Sandy Nice Replacement Papa Bear Sound Camel Evoke Primordial Feelings Horror Avoid Odd Easy Bff Heidi Commissions Care Friend Stat Wise Avoiding Commissions Hamstringing Progress Addition Bounty Board Levels Bit Requests Experience Variety Characters Requesting Standard Commissions Elsie Play Appeared Standard Commission Board Incredibly Simple Request Yields Rewards Airing Grievances Game True Perfect Bugs Plague Experience People Game Builds Grind Feels Satisfying Moderation Lot Options Customizing Yard House Romance Options Plenty Compared Game Post Marriage Content Hope Future Brings Bugfixes Content Lucky Sequel Hope Environment Portia 1 3 1 2 Desert Understand Major Plot Story Sand,POSITIVE,1,0,247,20,0.9250936329588015

2023-11-08,"this is one of the best life simulator games i have ever played, hands down! it does have a few minor problems but they're barely notable and the pros here far outweigh any cons.

what i think...

+ pros +
++++++++
+ beautiful visuals and characters
+ astounding game mechanics
+ tons and i do mean tons to do for hours on end
+ awesome crafting system
+ awesome building/upgrade system
+ easy to understand and play
+ challenging enemies
+ lots of quests and side missions
+ mail system that actually makes sense and lets you respond
+ town news that makes sense, you can subscribe to get updates on things happening in town
+ finally, a town that feels and looks legit, lots of stores, an arcade, and more
+ lots of mini games and events
+ lots of glorious cutscenes
+ feels very realistic in a lot of ways
+ gameplay draws you in a lot
+ lots of collectibles
+ lots of areas
+ singleplayer and multiplayer
+ lots of replay value


- cons -
----------
- multiplayer starts of with no house and a lot of missing buildings, this makes absolutely no sense
- controls in multiplayer are by default different than singleplayer, this too makes absolutely no sense
- player water tower to refill with water should have a visual meter to indicate water in it since it's extremely annoying just to have to open it up to check ever time and that makes it difficult to know if you're running low or not while busy with other town commisions and such. a simple visual meter on the side of the tank would make life so much better.
- a lot of the pop-ups such as hints/tips from quests and wandering around show up during cutscenes and can easily be missed as they don't stay there long so you might miss something important and thats very frustating


= verdict =
==========
= my time at sandrock takes everything about the first game and makes it even better plus a little more! there is literally so much detail and realism packed into this wonderful stylized game to keep you busy with the game for hours on end and when you think it stops no it doesn't you can take things on again pretty much through continued multiplayer! its a wonderful game with so many great gameplay machanics and you'll never want to put it down! i highly recommend it! i really hope to see this game come to android as well like the first one did! i would buy it on mobile in a heartbeat! thanks devs for making this amazing game!

2023-11-21,"[i]my time at portia[/i] was a real surprise for me when i first played it. i'm pretty sure i got it in a bundle. it looked like someone had repurposed the assets of a korean mmo from 2010. but it turned out to be an unexpectedly feature rich game with an interesting post-apocalyptic worldbuilding, gameplay with genuinely novel ideas in combining the day-to-day work cycle and socializing of [i]harvest moon[/i] with softer factory game mechanics and combat, and just a good amount of content that was fun despite the jank.

[i]my time at sandrock[/i] takes all the good ideas of its predecessor which felt accidentally good at many times, and elevates them so you can make no mistake that pathea are actually a really talented and hardworking company that knows what they're doing. is it free of jank? no, not really. but it's so chockful of good things that even the jank becomes charming. it has a great, interesting story full of characters with vibrant personalities and not the paper-thin cutouts you get in [i]stardew valley[/i]. the world of the setting is so fully realized despite the series' cartoony nature and you feel excited to explore and learn about it. it is genuinely laugh out loud funny at many points, and genuinely emotional at others. i have to give it up for the vas who don't seem like professionals but are still giving their best. the building gameplay while its core loop is the same, sees a lot of qol improvements. the combat is more dynamic and offers a bit of challenge though it's still on the casual side. there's so many small charming details too, like when you go on dates in-game, they put in an animation where your significant other holds your hand. they didn't have to do that. it has no mechanical value. it's just cute and it makes you feel good.

stuff like that is why i think most of all, what the game nails is that it makes it good to be in sandrock, and to see sandrock grow. everyone who plays games for long enough understands the feeling where a place in a game becomes like a real place we have visited and been in, and we feel a sort of nostalgia seeing it. i think sandrock will feel that way to many people playing the game, it's such a wonderfully crafted setting, and it really fulfills the promise of the genre of ""life sim"" where you can take a break from reality and live somewhere else for a little while. i'm not even done with the main story. i restarted with 1.0 to experience it as intended since in beta lots of the quests squished together in buggy ways as they were implemented, but i feel glad to have done that. this is gonna be a game i will have good memories of and consider a favorite years from now.

if you want to play multiplayer, you are stuck to a singular character per server. you cannot have multiple characters on a server and thus if you p[ay with a friend, but want to play fresh with another friend- you either delete your current character and make a new one, or change to a different server and make one there.

2023-11-17,"fantastic game, i immensely enjoyed my experience playing it. while not perfect, it massively improves on many aspects from its predecessor, my time at portia (mtap), while successfully experimenting with new ideas. most of my gripes with the game are largely small, inconsequential things, though there are a couple that really stood out as being almost impressively bad for such a great game. overall i loved it and i'm crushed that my play-through has ended. 8.5/10

[h3] pros [/h3]
 - huge boost in qol from mtap; inventory management is a dream, voiced dialogue is consistent instead of feeling random, you have more freedom to explore, and so on 
 - performance; i have a gtx 1070 and an i7700k so my rig is definitely aging...however i was easily able to keep my fps at 70+. the only dips were when most/all of the cast was on screen at once and was moving around (some firesides, but oddly not an issue during any of the festivals)
 - content; i just finished all the quests and my save file reads at 144 hours. there is a shockingly gargantuan amount of content to play through. while there are always ""fetch this"" quests, very few felt like their main purpose was to add filler *coughacvalhallacough* and the main quests carried a strong identity (sandrock is a dying town and constantly goes from crisis to crisis)
 - cast/writing; i felt most of the vas did a great job and overall the writing did a great job in both conveying humor and seriousness. every quest you take with justice + unsuur is full of golden dialogue, burgess is wonderfully self-aware, and so on.
 - music; a major step-up from mtap. i mean, the musical score for mtap wasn't bad per se...well the combat music and ruins exploration music were both pretty...okay everything but the sparring music was pretty mediocre (the sparring music slapped). mtas has a much, *much* better musical score in essentially every aspect.
 - impact; you as the protagonist have a large and meaningful impact in the game. sandrock goes through a food crisis, water crisis, vegetation crisis, and you can visually see the effects they have on the town, both before and after. it made me feel, in my opinion at least, like what i was doing was...purposeful, helpful. 
 - combat; they really stepped up the combat from mtap and it is a much smoother and more enjoyable experience. there are distinct weapon types: [strike] dual blades [/strike] daggers, greatsword, [strike] insect-less glaive [/strike] spear and [strike] sns [/strike] sword + shield, along with some guns, throwables, and a couple unique weapons. 
 - quality; less of a ""pro"" and more of ""not a con"", any game where items/gear posses quality tiers is fraught with danger. sandrock does a great job with quality (aside from the names, i mean ordinary -> oustanding -> perfect -> rare doesn't make sense to me). you can refine many items/weapons/gear to raise their level at the expense of a couple gems/minerals and it never feels like a brutal grind to do so....except for any item that wants agate to level up, agate sucks to get. literally everything else though is totally fine.
 - creativity; as mentioned sandrock is built on a pitifully small oasis. it used to be lush but has been almost entirely claimed by desertification. mechanically, the game requires you to use water to ""cool"" your machines (water being one of the very few parts of the game that remained an actual obstacle throughout the play through). you are not allowed to cut down any trees within the boundaries of sandrock proper (early game finding wood is a unique challenge). these, along with taking over a dozen kinds of scrap into the new recycling machines, do a fantastic job of mixing up game play and how new tiers of materials get introduced.

[h3] neutral [/h3] 
 - skill tree; your experience gets both added to a total, overall level (health/stamina) and divided into either social, gathering, workshop or combat based on where the xp was earned. this is a mixed bag for me because the perks are very obviously either ""must-haves"" (+1 break damage, +1 daily commission) or ""super terrible"" (any of the *many* perks that give you +10% xp/chance for/etc). the extra xp is bad because....

[h3] cons: [/h3] (review too long, only showing the two that plagued me)
 - difficulty; the game is easy. no, that's not fair. it is stunningly, disappointingly, shockingly easy. i'm not asking this to be dark souls; if i wanted that i'd...go play dark souls. what i mean is that i was over-leveled (>= 8 levels above) for 90% of the game,  and massively over-leveled (>= 14) for about 40% of it. the greater the level difference, the less damage is taken/received a-la borderlands style. immunity frames when dodging are [i] incredibly [/i] generous; you have i-frames for the entire animation and a little extra, meaning you can just chain rolls for invulnerability and you can lazily roll through the few environmental obstacles thrown at you. however, as you are far above the recommended level, you won't even be dodging because you barely get hurt. the bosses are actually well designed, far better than mtap...but again, you don't need to engage in any of their mechanics you are a much higher level than they. also there are 0 attacks that cannot be avoided by simply....running in a different direction. earned experience points are also far too generous. sparring pen and the dive buzzard near the railroad tracks were the only two fights that i felt challenged; every other combat experience was a cake-walk. pathea could slash all earned xp by 25% and *maybe* you'd fall into the recommended range, but only if you never explored, did side quests or commissions. this is why 40% of the skill tree feels pointless. every perk doesn't need to be in perfect balance...but i'm already stomping everything i do not need a 10% chance to get double experience for kicking trees. gear cannot be used it you are below it's specified level but, once more, that had 0 effect on my gameplay outside of the first couple in-game weeks. sandstorms are supposed to be deadly, you are told to either stay inside or don protective gear. spoiler, it doesn't matter. wear whatever you want. the game makes some light attempts into platforming (which were done well) with the exception of the massive arrows that always tell you where to go. i could go on; suffice it to say i loved so much of the game but i never really felt ""challenged"" at virtually any point.
 - path finding. i mean wow, i was blown away by how unbelievably abysmal the path finding is. i've watched sandrock residents get stuck walking into building corners, get stuck walking into plants, decorations, each other, things that are invisible to me yet inexplicably manifest a collision box, animals, fences...if it exists in game, they've gotten stuck on it. repeatedly. in the first 3 minutes of the game you are offered a tour by the ten-year-old jasmine who after saying, ""follow me"" immediately turns around and gets stuck on a rock. the ""solution"" was to cause a character to fade out and reappear after they fail to move in their desired direction for a couple seconds. they only sometimes do that. sometimes they just give up and stand there until something breaks their error loop (if you host a party expect to talk to everybody constantly so they dont freeze in place). sometimes the pathing routes of everybody (enemies included) get shifted. now the bumble ants that are on the hill 200 feet to the east of your workshop eternally try to path into your fence. if a sandrocker has been catastrophically shifted from their normal route you may watch as they teleport back and forth between two spots (looking at your pen, rocky and krystal). your children are a complete enigma and refuse to abide by any pathfinding laws. good luck trying to change that diaper

2023-11-16,"[h2] multiplayer feedback for my time at sandrock [/h2]

firstly, we want to express our appreciation for the unique multiplayer experience you've introduced in my time at sandrock. after investing over 50 hours+ into the game, my wife and i compiled our thoughts and feedback, focusing primarily on the multiplayer aspect. it's important to note that our feedback pertains exclusively to multiplayer, as we have yet to explore the single-player mode.

[b] let's delve into the areas that could use improvement: [/b]

[h3] 1. lack of freedom in a server-based world [/h3]
the introduction of a server-based world is both a blessing and a curse. while the ability to play even when the host is inactive is commendable, it restricts player freedom. in contrast to the multiplayer mechanics of [b]stardew valley[/b], where an account-based server offers players the freedom to modify the game using mods, console commands, and more, [b]my time at sandrock[/b] a sandbox multiplayer game focus falls short in this regard.
[list]
[*] comparison with stardew valley multiplayer

stardew valley allows mods and extensive customization, adding costumes to npcs, changing npc portraits, incorporating extra heart events, enhancing ui, introducing new characters, implementing console commands, even freezing time and more. the only limitation is the necessity for the host to be active, a trade-off that hasn't posed a significant issue, since i can just turn on my pc (i'm the host) and let them do whatever they want in the farm, even if my character faints due to lack of sleep, there are no adverse consequences or losses incurred because of the mods.

[*] impact on gameplay experience

the current server-based setup in [b]my time at sandrock[/b] detracts from the immersive storytelling experience. if one player is offline, progressing through quests and other activities becomes challenging due to the accelerated passage of in-game time. this time constraint induces stress rather than fostering a relaxing gameplay environment. the server is very strict when modifying our own world.
[/list]

[h3] 2. time progression does not stop in multiplayer mode even if you are alone. [/h3]
[list]
[*] a notable drawback of the server-based approach is that in multiplayer worlds with only one active player, time relentlessly marches on regardless if you are in menu mode, inventory, etc. this poses a challenge for players who meticulously plan and min-max their activities, especially when friends are offline. try to implement a ""private/account based"" multiplayer world, allowing players to host their own servers, would offer a solution to this predicament and empower players to play the game on their terms. ( some might say, stop playing and wait for your friends to get online ). 
[i]that would counter the fact that the multiplayer server-based is [b]useless[/b] since we have to wait for everyone to be online, right?[/i]
[/list]

[h3] 3. achievements and milestones in multiplayer [/h3]

[list]
[*] adding achievements to multiplayer mode seems to be a missed opportunity. while the game already features milestones, incorporating a system to track personal achievements and synchronizing them with steam achievements would enhance the multiplayer experience. if some achievement is only accessible in singleplayer, then we would have another reason to play the singleplayer mode.

[*] yes, you can play multiplayer mode for 500+ hours, complete everything you need and you still have 0/60 achievements. 
not cool.
[/list]

[h3] 4. shared storage challenges and quest completion [/h3]

[list]
[*] the existing shared storage system, offering capacities of 80(?), 120, and 300 at levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively, introduces significant challenges, particularly during the [b]early and mid-game phases[/b]. this challenge is accentuated in multiplayer scenarios where multiple players contribute to the shared storage. once the shared storage reaches its capacity, we're compelled to resort to ""personal storage,"" limiting access for other players.

[*] the inconvenience arises when different players hold distinct resources, gone offline then other players need those items for quests. they will have to farm again, since time does not stop. unlike the seamless, automatic quest item retrieval feature present in single-player mode, the multiplayer experience introduces additional complexities, requiring deliberate coordination among players to ensure efficient quest completion.

[h2] tl;dr [/h2]
basically, if you've played and enjoyed my time at portia, you'll enjoy this as it's more of the same but higher quality, there's more content, some of the kinks have been worked out and generally this is what i would classify as a good sequel.

if you haven't played mtap: this is essentially a ""cozy"" farm life sim game with all the genre staples (npc relationships, expanding operations, planning your day and your season in order to maximize €$, home customization, yada yada bing bong), except replace ""farm"" with ""mechanic"".
you take on requests for materials and finished products which progress in complexity as you upgrade and expand your workshop with new machines, better equipment, et cetera.

the game offers some customization of your experience, including a slider that speeds up or slows down the passage of in-game time. if you're into this genre of games, you will like this game. it's well put together, i personally haven't encountered any breaking bugs, it performs well, it looks nice and there's a lot to do.
[hr][/hr]

[h2]in detail[/h2]
[h3]the good[/h3]
[b]graphical quality[/b]
the game is quite a step up from portia, and comparing it to other offerings within the genre that adopt 3d visuals, i think only harvestella has it beat, in terms of technical quality (shaders, lighting, texture work et cetera) and details such as tufts of grass bobbing in the wind, sand particles and dust clouds blowing over arid terrain, npcs and mobs reacting to things happening around them.

[b]performance[/b]
i'm playing this on deck. when i first tried this on deck when i bought it roughly a year ago, i was forced to put the settings to a low preset, and my deck struggled to maintain 30fps. in the current version, in the year of our lord 2023, i have every graphical setting maxed out and the game is running between 30 and 60 fps on average. easily hitting 60fps in interiors.
all in all, with how the game looks, i think the performance is pretty impressive.

[b]sheer volume of content[/b]
i'm roughly 20 hours in to a new save on this version, and it feels as though i have yet to finish the first chapter in the story - i'm still witnessing new character introductions, npcs treat me as the ""new builder"". at the same time, literally every day since starting the game (i'm roughly at the end of the first in-game month) i've started the day with a new unique situation unfolding that day, ranging between character plot and main story beats, sometimes unlocking new features, sometimes unlocking new areas, sometimes just offering up new insights in characters or the world.
there also appears to be quite a breath of content. i haven't dipped my to into every system yet - i honestly don't even know roughly how much of the systems on offer i've engaged with. however, on top of the workshop, it appears you also gain access to more traditional elements such as farming plots and animal keeping. then there's a whole slew of activities available on certain days of the week, usually small in scope but quite numerous, such as making weekly deliveries of clay to the pottery artisan or helping with cleaning up the communal water supply. these may be simple activities, but they do help build a sense of community and add authenticity to the setting.
there's a lot more, but i can't be arsed getting in to it. just know that the main meat of the game (running the workshop) has quite a bit of depth, and at the same time there's breadth of content in the periphery.

[b]writing[/b]
people who played mtap know this already - the writers at pathea seem to have quite a bit of fun adding character to, well, the characters. this games' script has a lot of moving parts: when certain events trigger is directly influenced by your actions as a player, so the order in which events happen can't be guaranteed. despite this, the tone of the script is quite consistent. even if when you jump from a serious scene where the titular town is under assault to one where a writer is receiving eloquently phrased harsh critiques from a kid (""i'm in your tawget demogwaphic"" cracked me up) and you can see his heart break a little. this is all backed up by surprisingly good voice acting. the voice cast is varied, mostly fits the characters being depicted and the direction is excellent. this is a step up from portia.
i think they spent more time proofreading the game script as well, as even the little stuff like item and skill descriptions have been immaculate so far.

[b]game flow[/b]
this is hard to pin down exactly, but the game flows really well once you get into the rhythm of it. anyone who's played a game in this genre will know what i mean by that; you get into a routine, find out what works and what doesn't, and then you start scaling up and becoming a giant capitalist with a zillion weird lil machines churning out products, earning you a tidy profit. in sandrock, somehow, even early game resources kept feeling worthwhile to amass, and i ended up doing my best to figure out what to spend the day in in order to keep the machines running with stuff which would allow me to most efficiently complete next days' comissions.


[h3]the subjective[/h3]
[b]character art[/b]
love it or hate it, portia character designs were distinct. in sandrock, the style is a bit less pronounced. personally, i like it better this way, as i found the portia characters veered between distinct and grotesque.

[b]focus/direction[/b]
this game definitely requires you to explore and experiment a bit. a lot of information is available in-game, especially once you've discovered something e.g. a material will have details on how to procure it once obtained.

[h3]the bad[/h3]
[b]a sense of confusion and/or being overwhelmed[/b]
this game has the exact same issue as portia: it's front-loaded, and it doesn't always succeed in explaining all of its' mechanics due to the sheer amount of stuff there is to see and do. some things go completely unexplained and just sit there in the ui, staring at you accusatorily, daring you to interact with them and finding out what will happen. 
there's a lot of systems which is all fine and dandy, but you're also not incentivized to take your time figuring them all out. this makes especially the first few days of the game play out in a hectic fashion. i had to re-learn a bunch since it's been a hot minute since playing mtap, and starting this fresh would probably be worse. it's a shame, because i can imagine people being scared off by this. heck, i put down portia and almost never came back to it when i first played it, due to this exact issue.

[b]simultaneously polished and full of skung[/b]
this game contains nintendo levels of detail and polish in some areas, and gets extremely skungy in others, and these disparate levels of polish overlap at times. to illustrate: i'm watching a nicely choreographed cutscene complete with great lighting and what appears to be a blend of mo-cap and manually done character animations, lending it legitimacy while keeping consistent with the general art direction of the game. the cutscene ends. my character automatically starts pathing towards an arbitrary position, gets snagged on a fence, runs in place for a moment, phases out of existence, reappears a few meters away, and two npcs pop in next to them. all the while little shrubs are waving in the wind as a tumbleweed rolls by in the beautifully rendered sand drifts.
to be honest, this could be seen as a positive as well, considering the fact that all of portia nested comfortably in the janky skungzone, so it's a triump pathea have managed to elevate their work to this level. however, the disparity means that the skungness stands out more admidst the nintendonean polish levels, whereas in portia the entire vibe was skung so it just fit.",2257,H1 Basically Mtap H1 H2 Tl Dr H2 Basically Played Enjoyed Time Portia Enjoy Quality Content Kinks Classify Sequel Played Mtap Essentially Cozy Farm Life Sim Game Genre Staples Npc Relationships Expanding Operations Planning Day Season Maximize Customization Yada Yada Bing Bong Replace Farm Mechanic Requests Materials Finished Products Progress Complexity Upgrade Expand Workshop Machines Equipment Cetera Game Offers Customization Experience Including Slider Speeds Slows Passage Game Time Genre Games Game Personally Encountered Breaking Bugs Performs Nice Lot H2 H2 H3 H3 Graphical Quality Game Step Portia Comparing Offerings Genre Adopt 3D Visuals Harvestella Beat Terms Technical Quality Shaders Lighting Texture Cetera Details Tufts Grass Bobbing Wind Sand Particles Dust Clouds Blowing Arid Terrain Npcs Mobs Reacting Happening Performance Playing Deck Deck Bought Roughly Forced Settings Preset Deck Struggled Maintain 30Fps Current Version Lord 2023 Graphical Setting Maxed Game Running 30 60 Fps Average Easily Hitting 60Fps Interiors Game Performance Pretty Impressive Sheer Volume Content Roughly 20 Hours Save Version Feels Finish Chapter Story Witnessing Character Introductions Npcs Treat Builder Time Literally Day Starting Game Roughly Game Month Started Day Unique Situation Unfolding Day Ranging Character Plot Main Story Beats Unlocking Features Unlocking Offering Insights Characters Appears Breath Content Dipped Honestly Roughly Systems Offer Engaged Workshop Appears Gain Access Traditional Elements Farming Plots Animal Keeping Slew Activities Days Week Scope Numerous Weekly Deliveries Clay Pottery Artisan Helping Cleaning Communal Water Supply Simple Activities Build Sense Community Add Authenticity Setting Lot Arsed Main Meat Game Running Workshop Bit Depth Time Breadth Content Periphery Writing People Played Mtap Writers Pathea Bit Fun Adding Character Characters Games Script Lot Moving Events Trigger Influenced Actions Player Events Happen Guaranteed Tone Script Consistent Jump Scene Titular Town Assault Writer Receiving Eloquently Phrased Harsh Critiques Kid Tawget Demogwaphic Cracked Heart Break Surprisingly Voice Acting Voice Cast Varied Fits Characters Depicted Direction Excellent Step Portia Spent Time Proofreading Game Script Stuff Item Skill Descriptions Immaculate Game Flow Hard Pin Game Flows Rhythm Played Game Genre Routine Start Scaling Giant Capitalist Zillion Weird Lil Machines Churning Products Earning Tidy Profit Sandrock Game Resources Feeling Worthwhile Amass Figure Spend Day Machines Running Stuff Efficiently Complete Days Comissions H3 Subjective H3 Character Art Love Hate Portia Character Designs Distinct Sandrock Style Bit Pronounced Personally Portia Characters Veered Distinct Grotesque Focus Direction Game Requires Explore Experiment Bit Lot Game Discovered Material Details Procure H3 Bad H3 Sense Confusion Overwhelmed Game Exact Issue Portia Loaded Succeed Explaining Mechanics Sheer Stuff Completely Unexplained Sit Ui Staring Accusatorily Daring Interact Finding Happen Lot Systems Fine Dandy Incentivized Time Figuring Days Game Play Hectic Fashion Learn Bunch Hot Minute Playing Mtap Starting Fresh Worse Shame Imagine People Scared Heck Portia Played Exact Issue Simultaneously Polished Skung Game Nintendo Levels Polish Extremely Skungy Disparate Levels Polish Overlap Times Illustrate Watching Nicely Choreographed Cutscene Complete Lighting Appears Blend Cap Manually Character Animations Lending Legitimacy Keeping Consistent Art Direction Game Cutscene Character Automatically Starts Pathing Arbitrary Position Snagged Fence Runs Moment Phases Existence Reappears Meters Npcs Pop Shrubs Waving Wind Tumbleweed Rolls Beautifully Rendered Sand Drifts Honest Positive Portia Nested Comfortably Janky Skungzone Triump Pathea Managed Elevate Level Disparity Skungness Stands Admidst Nintendonean Polish Levels Portia Entire Vibe Skung Fit,POSITIVE,1,0,2,2,0.5

the story has an intriguing story and it is quite rewarding to see the impact you make on sandrock. without any spoilers, i'm very much looking forward to the next chapter in the ""my time"" world. i think most of the characters feel unique (to the other townsfolk, at least). the romance storylines i followed were sweet, but there are some characters that you will not interact with or be able to romance until very late game, which is kind of frustrating.

but to be honest, the game has a laundry list of basic quality audio, graphics, and  issues, even as the release date is right around the corner. also, if you grind through the storylines, some progression issues and quest overlapping are going to happen (at least during the pre-release phases).

in the meantime, you will have the chance to get to know these colorful characters better and learn a fair bit about the post-apocalyptic world they live in. with a much longer duration, this game manages to flesh out much of the worldbuilding the first title only alluded to.

2023-10-17,"tldr - this game is a gem with lots to do to keep you busy and runs well with minimal bugs.

   long main story, tons of sides, loveable characters, and scratches that builder itch you may have.  most of the lines are voice acted.  can get repetitive later levels and the story, whilst good, goes off the rails.  overall totally worth the price per content as in my first play though took 140 hours and i still didn't do everything i wanted... on play through 2 this time for a better set up to /romance all the characters =p.  oh, and you can save almost anytime minus like a super important event, but can usually save before or after, you don't have to wait for the sleep cycle.

  there are minor bugs, usually fixed with a reload.  some resources are a little too limited imo that commissions will flood your board.  resources start getting cluttered late game.  some features that were in portia are not here.  the game is set up for dlcs, which is fine.  i'm curious to see the generation features.  one of my npc couples had a baby later in the game, was a total mind melt, though this feature for the main character won't be released till launch.
 
  i can't really comment on the multiplayer aspect, only from what i've read from other users.  but, i'm judging this game as a standalone single player experience.  and at it's core, is a great game.  if there was some way to make multiplayer have different homesteads, i think that would make it ideal, but i think it's just sharing one property.

the story is engaging (200 hrs and i'm still not finished), the characters are interesting and lovable, the scenery is gorgeous, the pets are so. freaking. cute. and the controls are never clunky. i despise grinding in farming/crafting sims and that was not a problem here.

this game is visually stunning, has tons of character and the dialogue is super funny, i was not expecting to laugh so much. i was very invested in the main story, and everytime i felt smug about accurately predicting something, another twist would knock me off my pedestal. 
weeks before full release, my only qualms with this game are sandfishing (annoying but easily ignored) and building/decorating your house. there are too many size and placement restrictions for my taste. the other sets look great with similar assets that we have access to, so i'm hopeful for improvement.

many many improvements overall. most notably the graphics, improved character models, visuals & aesthetics of the game! 

the biggest and greatest change for me. is the storage. yes correct, storage and inventory management is a thing of the past with this new system! you can now auto-store all stacks of items across all your stashes at once! thus allowing you to keep unique items on you, but stack up all your inventory junk instantaneously. 
not only that. but your stashes act as a sort of backpack now. anything in your stashes count as being on your person for the sake of crafting, handing in commissions etc.. 
this is a game changer as the most tedious park of portia that burnt me out and prevented me from completing it. was the constant inventory management. in sandrock you can now auto-store all stacks then continue the focus on having fun! 

and boy is it fun! there is 2-4x the content than in portia, and with inventory management to the wayside. you can really dive in and just get lost in the experience!

i cannot recommend this game enough! i've been playing early access since about january this year and it's been incredible to see the game grow, as well as seeing how much the devs care about player feedback and incorporates it into the game. i've played through it a couple of times now and am still eager for the full release, as it's got solid replayability. 

pros:
+ story and writing are well done, fleshed out and engaging (and very funny!). it's also nice to have a post-apocalyptic game with a more positive spin on it, focused on rebuilding the town/nature.
+ engaging with npcs is integrated into the storylines so it feels more organic (rather than having to go out of your way too much to build friendships)
+ fixed lots of qol issues that were present in portia so it's far smoother and quicker to build
+ if you've got cozy game fatigue where it's all farming and fishing, this is a wonderful reprieve from that. while there is farming and fishing involved, it's mainly optional so i tend to avoid it altogether.

2023-11-14,"let's just get the important bit out of the way first: this is my 2023 game of the year. it was only a matter of when the game would come out of early access to claim its crown.

now then, on to why this game is, as of this writing, my 6th most-played title in terms of hours on my steam account.

it's basically everything from my time at portia, but improved upon and made better in every possible way. the world is bigger, the building mechanics refined to a visible-from-space shine, the action rpg story fleshed out in a way that makes it the primary driver of gameplay rather than purely a framing device.

indeed, this is less a cozy game with action-rpg elements and more a reimagining of the action rpg formula where cozy game mechanics are the primary driver of progression. the genres blend seamlessly in a way that they never have before—looking at you, horizon zero dawn and forbidden west and every ubisoft game, where the crafting is tedious and feels unnecessary.

but at the same time, this game also has a cozy soul. if you're played any harvest moon-like, the life sim elements are exactly what you want them to be and then some. building relationships with villagers, romance, family life, it's all there with plenty of choices and some remarkably well-written relationship and character backstory dialogue. there are just so many ways to get a villager's friendship up compared to, say, stardew valley's more traditional talk-and-gift approach, and with the anti-frustration feature of not having to talk to every villager every day just to keep their relationship level from backsliding.

speaking of anti-frustration features, there are plenty more in this game as well. none of the main story quests are timed; complete them at your leisure. get overleveled if the combat's not your strong suit. rush the main story quests to unlock more of the crafting recipes if that's your jam. speedrunners and challenge runners? go to town, the game's got plenty of measurable ways to keep score. 

almost none of the sidequests are timed. if you unlock them too fast, as happens when you're powering through the main quest and hitting every character's sidequest trigger faster than you can bang them out, well, take a step back and take your time. the devs listened to players during the early access stage of the process and took the most common frustration—players felt rushed—out of the game. you want to complete them as fast as possible, nothing's stopping you. but it all fits in with the overarching theme of well-camouflaged accessibility that never feels like it's being dumbed down.

as for the action and combat in the action rpg, well, the devs know they're not from software. this isn't going to challenge anyone with a firm grounding in action games. you can overpower just about anything in the game because the devs have consciously avoided the bethesda syndrome of level-scaling enemies. well, with one exception—going too far afield in a sandstorm is going to surprise you the first time you run into high-level versions of basic enemies—but even that is a smart stylistic choice that makes sandstorms feel appropriately dangerous and threatening for a game set against the backdrop of a desert environment with a strong ""green aesop"" running through the main story.

is the game perfect? well, no, no game is perfect, not even games that are otherwise among the greatest of all time (i say this as someone who loved everything about red dead redemption 2 except for the on-rails quest design, for example.)

for one thing, the fishing minigame is one of the weakest i've seen in this genre. it's simplistic and repetitive and offers almost no challenge and very little reason to even engage with it beyond a couple of cooking recipes. this is a shame, especially since portia's fishing minigame was quite fun and other games like stardew, animal crossing (and dinkum, which cribs heavily from it), and even red dead 2 have great outdoorsman-style fishing gameplay.

in addition, there are a couple of dungeons in the midgame that have a jarring tonal shift toward platformer gameplay. thankfully the devs refined it a bit after its initial introduction; jumps are more forgiving, there's plenty of ""coyote time"" with ledges, and there's the option to skip the trickiest segments if you fail them enough times, but for a game that otherwise has good dungeon design, there's a heavy ""why, devs?"" when playing the two dungeons in question.

but those are minor quibbles in a game that is otherwise the absolute apex of the cozy game genre with one heck of a story rpg to go with it.

if you want to play multiplayer, you are stuck to a singular character per server. you cannot have multiple characters on a server and thus if you p[ay with a friend, but want to play fresh with another friend- you either delete your current character and make a new one, or change to a different server and make one there.

it does have the odd bug now and again, but the devs are actively listening to player feedback and are cranking out patches to fix as many issues as they can. currently multiplayer is having some issues and there are some performance issues at least when it comes to load times (especially cutscenes).

there's gathering, building, monster fighting (which is almost too ez at this time), pets, romance, events, characters with depth (for the most part), transmog for outfits, home decor/building and even children! theres a lot and apparently they're hinting at adding even more and/or fleshing more out.

2023-11-09,"      as someone who has played their fair share of life simulation games, with the variety of animal crossing, stardew valley, and palia to be some of the main ones, this game comes very close to beating them all. i was thrilled to find out that this game was going to have multiplayer in it, seeing as my time at portia does not have multiplayer, which heavily influenced my choice to buy it or not.

      this game can be buggy at times and while i only have a 980 gpu, i can run this game at medium settings and it still looks pretty decent. i did not play the early access, only full release, and i can say that there seems to be quite a bit of content to this game. this game is very multifaceted with social/town, farming, combat, mining, building, animal, and pet aspects, with that just being what i have discovered with 19 hours of playing. i play with 2 other people and the game runs fairly well. i have only encountered a few lag/server sync issues between other players, a few ui glitch errors, and 1 wonky combat fight with an elite. but beyond those few things i haven't seen much to stop me from wanting to play this game as much as possible. 


[h3] pros [/h3]
- lots of content (19 hours in and it feels like i have so much more to do)
- decent price (i was gifted the game but seeing the price for how fun this game is seems fair)
- fun with friends
- multiplayer actual works
- leveling up feels important and good
- missions feel good and not like leg work (you can visually see the work you put into the town)
- tons of townspeople
- combat feels good and fun
- character customization (you can super customize your character with sliders)
- gear (weapons and clothes have stats that can help you with gathering and fighting)
- weather (the weather events in this game are really great. so far i have seen rain, sandstorm, and summer 
   heat. i am waiting to see snow in this game as of yet.)
- server stays up (no matter who owns the town, i am able to play on my friends server even after the 
   person who made it has left. this is a big game changer for me seeing as you don't have to stop playing on 
   one server because the host has left or crashed.)

[h3] cons [/h3]

- desync/stutter issues (i have only had this happen 2-3 times playing so far and it is fixed by a simple return 
  to lobby and rejoin.)
- ui machine icons disappear (i have only seen this once and it was fixed by rejoining the lobby)
- forced personal chests (i mention this because it was a pain to have only so much room in the one 
   community chest you get at the start of the game. you can upgrade it, but i would like to have the option 
   to share my personal chest contents if i choose to. and not have to run back to home every time someone 
   needed something.
- combat (could use a little work on hit registration and how your character can go through the enemies 
   while swinging your weapon)
- accidental playable character requests (in the game there is an option to talk to real people and play a 
   mini-game called critters. it feels a bit annoying at times when you are trying to interact with machines or 
   doors and other playable characters get the input over the item/machine/door. could be quite annoying if 
   playing with a lot of people in one area but not too bad overall.)

2023-11-17,"fantastic game, i immensely enjoyed my experience playing it. while not perfect, it massively improves on many aspects from its predecessor, my time at portia (mtap), while successfully experimenting with new ideas. most of my gripes with the game are largely small, inconsequential things, though there are a couple that really stood out as being almost impressively bad for such a great game. overall i loved it and i'm crushed that my play-through has ended. 8.5/10

[h3] pros [/h3]
 - huge boost in qol from mtap; inventory management is a dream, voiced dialogue is consistent instead of feeling random, you have more freedom to explore, and so on 
 - performance; i have a gtx 1070 and an i7700k so my rig is definitely aging...however i was easily able to keep my fps at 70+. the only dips were when most/all of the cast was on screen at once and was moving around (some firesides, but oddly not an issue during any of the festivals)
 - content; i just finished all the quests and my save file reads at 144 hours. there is a shockingly gargantuan amount of content to play through. while there are always ""fetch this"" quests, very few felt like their main purpose was to add filler *coughacvalhallacough* and the main quests carried a strong identity (sandrock is a dying town and constantly goes from crisis to crisis)
 - cast/writing; i felt most of the vas did a great job and overall the writing did a great job in both conveying humor and seriousness. every quest you take with justice + unsuur is full of golden dialogue, burgess is wonderfully self-aware, and so on.
 - music; a major step-up from mtap. i mean, the musical score for mtap wasn't bad per se...well the combat music and ruins exploration music were both pretty...okay everything but the sparring music was pretty mediocre (the sparring music slapped). mtas has a much, *much* better musical score in essentially every aspect.
 - impact; you as the protagonist have a large and meaningful impact in the game. sandrock goes through a food crisis, water crisis, vegetation crisis, and you can visually see the effects they have on the town, both before and after. it made me feel, in my opinion at least, like what i was doing was...purposeful, helpful. 
 - combat; they really stepped up the combat from mtap and it is a much smoother and more enjoyable experience. there are distinct weapon types: [strike] dual blades [/strike] daggers, greatsword, [strike] insect-less glaive [/strike] spear and [strike] sns [/strike] sword + shield, along with some guns, throwables, and a couple unique weapons. 
 - quality; less of a ""pro"" and more of ""not a con"", any game where items/gear posses quality tiers is fraught with danger. sandrock does a great job with quality (aside from the names, i mean ordinary -> oustanding -> perfect -> rare doesn't make sense to me). you can refine many items/weapons/gear to raise their level at the expense of a couple gems/minerals and it never feels like a brutal grind to do so....except for any item that wants agate to level up, agate sucks to get. literally everything else though is totally fine.
 - creativity; as mentioned sandrock is built on a pitifully small oasis. it used to be lush but has been almost entirely claimed by desertification. mechanically, the game requires you to use water to ""cool"" your machines (water being one of the very few parts of the game that remained an actual obstacle throughout the play through). you are not allowed to cut down any trees within the boundaries of sandrock proper (early game finding wood is a unique challenge). these, along with taking over a dozen kinds of scrap into the new recycling machines, do a fantastic job of mixing up game play and how new tiers of materials get introduced.

[h3] neutral [/h3] 
 - skill tree; your experience gets both added to a total, overall level (health/stamina) and divided into either social, gathering, workshop or combat based on where the xp was earned. this is a mixed bag for me because the perks are very obviously either ""must-haves"" (+1 break damage, +1 daily commission) or ""super terrible"" (any of the *many* perks that give you +10% xp/chance for/etc). the extra xp is bad because....

[h3] cons: [/h3] (review too long, only showing the two that plagued me)
 - difficulty; the game is easy. no, that's not fair. it is stunningly, disappointingly, shockingly easy. i'm not asking this to be dark souls; if i wanted that i'd...go play dark souls. what i mean is that i was over-leveled (>= 8 levels above) for 90% of the game,  and massively over-leveled (>= 14) for about 40% of it. the greater the level difference, the less damage is taken/received a-la borderlands style. immunity frames when dodging are [i] incredibly [/i] generous; you have i-frames for the entire animation and a little extra, meaning you can just chain rolls for invulnerability and you can lazily roll through the few environmental obstacles thrown at you. however, as you are far above the recommended level, you won't even be dodging because you barely get hurt. the bosses are actually well designed, far better than mtap...but again, you don't need to engage in any of their mechanics you are a much higher level than they. also there are 0 attacks that cannot be avoided by simply....running in a different direction. earned experience points are also far too generous. sparring pen and the dive buzzard near the railroad tracks were the only two fights that i felt challenged; every other combat experience was a cake-walk. pathea could slash all earned xp by 25% and *maybe* you'd fall into the recommended range, but only if you never explored, did side quests or commissions. this is why 40% of the skill tree feels pointless. every perk doesn't need to be in perfect balance...but i'm already stomping everything i do not need a 10% chance to get double experience for kicking trees. gear cannot be used it you are below it's specified level but, once more, that had 0 effect on my gameplay outside of the first couple in-game weeks. sandstorms are supposed to be deadly, you are told to either stay inside or don protective gear. spoiler, it doesn't matter. wear whatever you want. the game makes some light attempts into platforming (which were done well) with the exception of the massive arrows that always tell you where to go. i could go on; suffice it to say i loved so much of the game but i never really felt ""challenged"" at virtually any point.
 - path finding. i mean wow, i was blown away by how unbelievably abysmal the path finding is. i've watched sandrock residents get stuck walking into building corners, get stuck walking into plants, decorations, each other, things that are invisible to me yet inexplicably manifest a collision box, animals, fences...if it exists in game, they've gotten stuck on it. repeatedly. in the first 3 minutes of the game you are offered a tour by the ten-year-old jasmine who after saying, ""follow me"" immediately turns around and gets stuck on a rock. the ""solution"" was to cause a character to fade out and reappear after they fail to move in their desired direction for a couple seconds. they only sometimes do that. sometimes they just give up and stand there until something breaks their error loop (if you host a party expect to talk to everybody constantly so they dont freeze in place). sometimes the pathing routes of everybody (enemies included) get shifted. now the bumble ants that are on the hill 200 feet to the east of your workshop eternally try to path into your fence. if a sandrocker has been catastrophically shifted from their normal route you may watch as they teleport back and forth between two spots (looking at your pen, rocky and krystal). your children are a complete enigma and refuse to abide by any pathfinding laws. good luck trying to change that diaper

2023-11-16,"[h2] multiplayer feedback for my time at sandrock [/h2]

firstly, we want to express our appreciation for the unique multiplayer experience you've introduced in my time at sandrock. after investing over 50 hours+ into the game, my wife and i compiled our thoughts and feedback, focusing primarily on the multiplayer aspect. it's important to note that our feedback pertains exclusively to multiplayer, as we have yet to explore the single-player mode.

[b] let's delve into the areas that could use improvement: [/b]

[h3] 1. lack of freedom in a server-based world [/h3]
the introduction of a server-based world is both a blessing and a curse. while the ability to play even when the host is inactive is commendable, it restricts player freedom. in contrast to the multiplayer mechanics of [b]stardew valley[/b], where an account-based server offers players the freedom to modify the game using mods, console commands, and more, [b]my time at sandrock[/b] a sandbox multiplayer game focus falls short in this regard.
[list]
[*] comparison with stardew valley multiplayer

stardew valley allows mods and extensive customization, adding costumes to npcs, changing npc portraits, incorporating extra heart events, enhancing ui, introducing new characters, implementing console commands, even freezing time and more. the only limitation is the necessity for the host to be active, a trade-off that hasn't posed a significant issue, since i can just turn on my pc (i'm the host) and let them do whatever they want in the farm, even if my character faints due to lack of sleep, there are no adverse consequences or losses incurred because of the mods.

[*] impact on gameplay experience

the current server-based setup in [b]my time at sandrock[/b] detracts from the immersive storytelling experience. if one player is offline, progressing through quests and other activities becomes challenging due to the accelerated passage of in-game time. this time constraint induces stress rather than fostering a relaxing gameplay environment. the server is very strict when modifying our own world.
[/list]

[h3] 2. time progression does not stop in multiplayer mode even if you are alone. [/h3]
[list]
[*] a notable drawback of the server-based approach is that in multiplayer worlds with only one active player, time relentlessly marches on regardless if you are in menu mode, inventory, etc. this poses a challenge for players who meticulously plan and min-max their activities, especially when friends are offline. try to implement a ""private/account based"" multiplayer world, allowing players to host their own servers, would offer a solution to this predicament and empower players to play the game on their terms. ( some might say, stop playing and wait for your friends to get online ). 
[i]that would counter the fact that the multiplayer server-based is [b]useless[/b] since we have to wait for everyone to be online, right?[/i]
[/list]

[h3] 3. achievements and milestones in multiplayer [/h3]

[list]
[*] adding achievements to multiplayer mode seems to be a missed opportunity. while the game already features milestones, incorporating a system to track personal achievements and synchronizing them with steam achievements would enhance the multiplayer experience. if some achievement is only accessible in singleplayer, then we would have another reason to play the singleplayer mode.

[*] yes, you can play multiplayer mode for 500+ hours, complete everything you need and you still have 0/60 achievements. 
not cool.
[/list]

[h3] 4. shared storage challenges and quest completion [/h3]

[list]
[*] the existing shared storage system, offering capacities of 80(?), 120, and 300 at levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively, introduces significant challenges, particularly during the [b]early and mid-game phases[/b]. this challenge is accentuated in multiplayer scenarios where multiple players contribute to the shared storage. once the shared storage reaches its capacity, we're compelled to resort to ""personal storage,"" limiting access for other players.

[*] the inconvenience arises when different players hold distinct resources, gone offline then other players need those items for quests. they will have to farm again, since time does not stop. unlike the seamless, automatic quest item retrieval feature present in single-player mode, the multiplayer experience introduces additional complexities, requiring deliberate coordination among players to ensure efficient quest completion.
[/list]

[h3] final note [/h3]

since this review is heavily focused on the multiplayer mode, we regrettably find it necessary to vote ""do not recommend"" for players specifically seeking a satisfying multiplayer experience. we remain hopeful that future updates will address these concerns, and we are open to revising our review once improvements are implemented.",11028,H2 Multiplayer Feedback Time Sandrock H2 Firstly Express Appreciation Unique Multiplayer Experience Introduced Time Sandrock Investing 50 Hours Game Wife Compiled Feedback Focusing Multiplayer Aspect Note Feedback Pertains Exclusively Multiplayer Explore Single Player Mode Delve Improvement H3 1 Lack Freedom Server Based H3 Introduction Server Based Blessing Curse Ability Play Host Inactive Commendable Restricts Player Freedom Contrast Multiplayer Mechanics Stardew Valley Account Based Server Offers Players Freedom Modify Game Mods Console Commands Time Sandrock Sandbox Multiplayer Game Focus Falls Short Regard List Comparison Stardew Valley Multiplayer Stardew Valley Mods Extensive Customization Adding Costumes Npcs Changing Npc Portraits Incorporating Extra Heart Events Enhancing Ui Introducing Characters Implementing Console Commands Freezing Time Limitation Necessity Host Active Trade Posed Issue Pc Host Farm Character Faints Lack Sleep Adverse Consequences Losses Incurred Mods Impact Gameplay Experience Current Server Based Setup Time Sandrock Detracts Immersive Storytelling Experience Player Offline Progressing Quests Activities Challenging Accelerated Passage Game Time Time Constraint Induces Stress Fostering Relaxing Gameplay Environment Server Strict Modifying List H3 2 Time Progression Multiplayer Mode H3 List Notable Drawback Server Based Approach Multiplayer Worlds Active Player Time Relentlessly Marches Menu Mode Inventory Poses Challenge Players Meticulously Plan Min Max Activities Friends Offline Implement Private Account Based Multiplayer Allowing Players Host Servers Offer Solution Predicament Empower Players Play Game Terms Playing Wait Friends Online Counter Multiplayer Server Based Useless Wait Online List H3 3 Achievements Milestones Multiplayer H3 List Adding Achievements Multiplayer Mode Missed Opportunity Game Features Milestones Incorporating Track Personal Achievements Synchronizing Steam Achievements Enhance Multiplayer Experience Achievement Accessible Singleplayer Reason Play Singleplayer Mode Play Multiplayer Mode 500 Hours Complete 0 60 Achievements Cool List H3 4 Shared Storage Challenges Quest Completion H3 List Existing Shared Storage Offering Capacities 80 120 300 Levels 1 2 3 Introduces Challenges Mid Game Phases Challenge Accentuated Multiplayer Scenarios Multiple Players Contribute Shared Storage Shared Storage Reaches Capacity Compelled Resort Personal Storage Limiting Access Players Inconvenience Arises Players Hold Distinct Resources Offline Players Items Quests Farm Time Seamless Automatic Quest Item Retrieval Feature Single Player Mode Multiplayer Experience Introduces Additional Complexities Requiring Deliberate Coordination Players Ensure Efficient Quest Completion List H3 Final Note H3 Review Heavily Focused Multiplayer Mode Regrettably Vote Recommend Players Seeking Satisfying Multiplayer Experience Remain Hopeful Future Updates Address Concerns Revising Review Improvements Implemented,POSITIVE,1,0,35,4,0.8974358974358975

2023-11-15,"update as of 11/27/23:
though many problems persist, the developers have already addressed many of them. even some of the fairly minor bugs. they are active on the game's subreddit and if you have a very specific bug, they will ask for your save file so they can look into it directly. i had a minor (but extremely frustrating) bug fixed within days as a result of this. 

so i am confident that after a couple more months of polish, all the minor quibbles i brought up in my original review will be mostly addressed. i think due to the fundamental way the game's story is set up and how it runs alongside some of the side content - namely the myriad optional relationships with the npcs - these things will probably never be perfect. so do yourself a favor and do not get married and have children until you are just about finished with the main story. you will save yourself a lot of immersion breaks and disappointments. numerous moments where there should be special dialogue for a character if you are dating or married to them but there simply isn't - and to be fair it seems like in some cases there is special dialogue, but not for the character i had romanced apparently. which is baffling since they weren't exactly a late addition to the game to my knowledge. 

regardless, since the developers have proven they are willing to keep working on and improving the game i can definitely recommend it now. maybe give it a couple more months to bake, but definitely pick it up if you've ever enjoyed a game in this genre - stardew valley, harvest moon, etc. - because you ultimately wont be disappointed in the overall experience. 

-

he's a 10, buuuuut.....

overall this is a pretty good game, and there's a lot of fun to be had in it. despite my negative review, i will keep playing it. and if you like games like stardew valley, you'll almost certainly like this one. the basic gameplay loop is fine - great even, if a little stale after awhile. and the story - likewise very enjoyable! the characters are, for the most part, unique and interesting and generally quite humorous. overall i should be able to recommend this game. so why don't i?

it's the little things. lots and lots of little things. for me, i play a game like this as a kind of escapism. i lose myself in the story and in getting to know the cast of characters - however cheesy it all might be. and in general, this game provides that better than most you might play, without the heaping dose of grim reality and tragedy you'll get from something like baldur's gate 3. it's a happy escapist fantasy. until you encounter (not bugs, because i did not encounter any that were not ultimately harmless and funny) some of the poorly or lazily implemented features.

obviously, you can date and marry and have kids with a good number of the characters. this is to be expected of this genre, and the process of getting to know these characters, through a variety of quests and events both focused on them and not, is quite a bit of fun. you will probably become quite invested in them. until you finish their content and they become hollow and uninteresting shells. they don't do or say anything new or interesting past a certain point - which is to be expected, but it is exacerbated by other things as i will point out. the dating/hangout mini game becomes a chore because after a couple of those you will have exhausted the dialogue with a given character - and that dialogue will not update even if you are actively in a relationship or married to the character. 

to make matters even worse, the story will not take any of this into account. whether or not you are dating a given character, or married to them even, will never come up outside of the one off wedding event or when talking to that character directly to get one of their canned lines of repetitive marriage dialogue - which are cute sure enough, but you can only hear them so many times before they lose all their charm. 

for a truly horrible example of how absurd this can get, at one point during the story you are to venture into a toxic environment full of extremely hostile enemies that want to kill you. all well and good, yea? well, if you are married to one of the characters involved, that character could be pregnant at the time of this quest. this does not come up...so your fun little happy escapism is irreparably ruined because the game is now sending your pregnant wife into a life and death situation because the smallest effort was not made to actually integrate the relationship and marriage system into the story in any way. 

and speaking of pregnancy, it's hilarious - from  a male character's perspective, i do not know how it differs if you play a female character and are the one to get pregnant. you will be teleported one morning to the hospital to see your spouse holding the baby, you will be prompted to name it, pick what the child will call you, and then you will be returned home. your spouse will be gone, already off following their preset schedule (which does not change even when you marry them by the way, they still follow the same routine as they do by default, except when it is interupted by the tasks you can choose to assign them). when you catch up to them...not a single damn mention of the baby they just pushed out. the entire system is barely implemented and it's kind of ridiculous. harvest moon 64 almost 30 years ago had a more robust and interesting system of marriage and children. what they've cobbled together here has the bones of something perfectly adequate, great even, but there is basically no connective tissue to bring it all together. 

overall, the game is quite good for what it is, and despite my negativity there is much to enjoy. but this is a life sim game, and the quite frankly pathetic implementation of some very important systems to the success of a game in that genre - dating, marriage, and children - leave a massive gaping hole in it. fixing these things would not even require a massive revamp of the game. just some basic time and care to make these choices feel as impactful as they should. lockout marriage until a point in the story where it cant create awkward situations, for example. implement new dialogues to accurately reflect relationship changes - despite all the voice acting a significant amount of the dialogue is unvoiced, so it is not even a question of needing to record new lines. just write more dialogue and shove it in there.",11594,Update 11 27 23 Persist Developers Addressed Minor Bugs Active Game Subreddit Specific Bug Save File Minor Extremely Frustrating Bug Fixed Days Result Confident Couple Months Polish Minor Quibbles Brought Original Review Addressed Fundamental Game Story Set Runs Content Myriad Optional Relationships Npcs Perfect Favor Married Children Finished Main Story Save Lot Immersion Breaks Disappointments Numerous Moments Special Dialogue Character Dating Married Simply Fair Special Dialogue Character Romanced Baffling Late Addition Game Knowledge Developers Proven Improving Game Recommend Couple Months Bake Pick Enjoyed Game Genre Stardew Valley Harvest Moon Ultimately Disappointed Experience Buuuuut Pretty Game Lot Fun Negative Review Playing Games Stardew Valley Basic Gameplay Loop Fine Stale Awhile Story Enjoyable Characters Unique Humorous Recommend Game Lots Lots Play Game Escapism Lose Story Cast Characters Cheesy Game Play Heaping Dose Grim Reality Tragedy Baldur Gate 3 Happy Escapist Fantasy Encounter Bugs Encounter Ultimately Harmless Funny Lazily Implemented Features Marry Kids Characters Expected Genre Process Characters Variety Quests Events Focused Bit Fun Invested Finish Content Hollow Uninteresting Shells Expected Exacerbated Dating Hangout Mini Game Chore Couple Exhausted Dialogue Character Dialogue Update Actively Relationship Married Character Matters Worse Story Account Dating Character Married Wedding Event Talking Character Canned Lines Repetitive Marriage Dialogue Cute Hear Times Lose Charm Horrible Absurd Story Venture Toxic Environment Extremely Hostile Enemies Kill Yea Married Characters Involved Character Pregnant Time Quest Fun Happy Escapism Irreparably Ruined Game Sending Pregnant Wife Life Death Situation Effort Integrate Relationship Marriage Story Speaking Pregnancy Hilarious Male Character Perspective Differs Play Female Character Pregnant Teleported Morning Hospital Spouse Holding Baby Prompted Pick Child Returned Spouse Preset Schedule Change Marry Follow Routine Default Interupted Tasks Choose Assign Catch Single Damn Mention Baby Pushed Entire Barely Implemented Ridiculous Harvest Moon 64 30 Robust Marriage Children Cobbled Bones Perfectly Adequate Basically Connective Tissue Bring Game Negativity Enjoy Life Sim Game Frankly Pathetic Implementation Systems Success Game Genre Dating Marriage Children Leave Massive Gaping Hole Fixing Require Massive Revamp Game Basic Time Care Choices Feel Impactful Lockout Marriage Story Create Awkward Situations Implement Dialogues Accurately Reflect Relationship Voice Acting Dialogue Unvoiced Question Record Lines Write Dialogue Shove,POSITIVE,1,0,42,1,0.9767441860465116
2023-11-15,"this is a hard one to judge. this game is a culmination of both what i love and hate about modern video games.

pros:
* the game loop isn't bad. it's similar to the predecessor and they didn't modify it much from there. 
* the characters in the game are pretty decent and distinct. some of them develop in unexpected ways which is neat.
* there ""larger than life"" events that do better than what its predecessor had.
* the conveniences later on are better than what was in its predecessor (with unfortunate caveats due to bugs).
* a cozy quality-of-life game.

cons:
* this game is buggy to a point i'm not sure how the hell it was released like it was. some of the bugs are similar to what i saw in early versions of its predecessor game which tells me they didn't learn much from their mistakes in implementation. i've made a list i can remember off the top of my head below.

* the combat is pretty weak. i didn't pay much attention to the early access but i was hoping they'd really make the combat more interesting. make no mistake that it's definitely better than what portia had. there's more variety here but it's literally ""smash the x button"" when you get down to it.

* after awhile, farming and mining stuff becomes repetitive which thankfully becomes easier. [strike]unfortunately, because the factory has such a fucked up implementation and literally doesn't work half the time, that convenience can be more irritating than helpful.[/strike] there's also no way to farm certain stuff or to get someone else to fetch it like agate. you have to go out and spend 5-10 minutes picking them 2 at a time. this isn't as big of a deal though, you don't generally need agate that often but for example, flourite you do since certain items that show up on commission require it to increase rarity. the only other way to get that is through ruin tokens which is already expensive and time consuming to obtain....

* some commissions are a trap. it might look easy but they want increased rarity on something like a steel bar which requires flourite to create which is an absolute pain in the ass to get. these commissions are never worth the gold they give (and they don't give much generally). they're there to make you feel miserable. the game should give double gold for such requests or triple gold for rare quality items.

all that said... i've already gotten over 100 hours out of it and i'll probably finish it. i'd wait for a sale but i'd be lying if i said i didn't enjoy it. there isn't really any challenge to it which kinda kills it a little bit. you can fail some stuff but you either have to try to fail it or fail it via a bug. 

bugs i saw while playing:
* literally first five minutes into the game, you'll notice that coco the bird fly's sideways and slow as if running into a wall. literally shows in one of the earliest cutscenes as you start playing.

* mobs and npcs end up your workshop seemingly lost, as if their pathing is telling them to go there for some reason and then they just literally run around doing nothing.

* soft locks are brimming in this game. they seem to be worse when you play the game for extended periods of time which brings me to...

* the game has some issues when played for long periods of time. things load slower or not at all, animations are wonkier, sound may not occur at all having you miss actually interesting voice lines.

* [strike]the factory you get later into the game is a broken mess. the ui doesn't update properly, parts of the ui doesn't work with controller for some reason, and multiple times now i've had the recycler ""production queue"" absolutely busted to where it was unusable. things that should produce more than one of a thing, for example bullets (5 each) or copper screws (2 each), will only produce one which is a clear bug since it shouldn't take fucking 20 steel bars and 50 gunpowder to make literally 10 rifle bullets, but doing the same thing directly on a forge would give you 50.[/strike] this was fixed in latest patch of this writing.

* npcs will fall to the bottom of the map, teleport endlessly, float in the sky or just out of reach, or not be able to interact with them at all until you leave the room or restart the game even.

* npc pathing will often put them smack dab in the middle of a cutscene where they mob pile to the point you can't see anything going on anymore.

* i've softlocked on a lot of scenes that want your character to automatically moved but apparently, i'm alone in this according to the forums.

* i've had the planting grid get stuck in 5x5 when in 4x4 mode, then plant incorrectly. this was with the robot: f machine. edit: there is a 5x5 mode later in the game but the robot isn't supposed to have it. 

* quests not triggering which would then fail after time passes.

* too many events scheduled at once. i had several quests on the same day as the day of memories, all at 1600.  they not only won't reschedule any of them, they also will cause bugs like not letting you join the ghost hunting event.

* probably more i'm not thinking of or too small of a bug to care.",11594,Hard Judge Game Culmination Love Hate Modern Video Games Pros Game Loop Bad Predecessor Modify Characters Game Pretty Decent Distinct Develop Unexpected Neat Larger Life Events Predecessor Conveniences Predecessor Unfortunate Caveats Bugs Cozy Quality Life Game Cons Game Buggy Released Bugs Versions Predecessor Game Tells Learn Mistakes Implementation List Remember Head Combat Pretty Weak Pay Attention Access Hoping Combat Mistake Portia Variety Literally Smash Button Awhile Farming Mining Stuff Repetitive Thankfully Easier Strike Factory Fucked Implementation Literally Time Convenience Irritating Helpful Strike Farm Stuff Fetch Agate Spend 5 Minutes Picking 2 Time Deal Agate Flourite Items Commission Require Increase Rarity Ruin Tokens Expensive Time Consuming Commissions Trap Easy Increased Rarity Steel Bar Requires Flourite Create Absolute Pain Ass Commissions Worth Gold Feel Miserable Game Double Gold Requests Triple Gold Rare Quality Items 100 Hours Finish Wait Sale Lying Enjoy Challenge Kinda Kills Bit Fail Stuff Fail Fail Bug Bugs Playing Literally Minutes Game Notice Coco Bird Fly Sideways Slow Running Wall Literally Earliest Cutscenes Start Playing Mobs Npcs Workshop Seemingly Lost Pathing Telling Reason Literally Soft Locks Brimming Game Worse Play Game Extended Periods Time Brings Game Issues Played Periods Time Load Slower Animations Wonkier Sound Occur Voice Lines Strike Factory Game Broken Mess Ui Update Properly Ui Controller Reason Multiple Times Recycler Production Queue Absolutely Busted Unusable Produce Bullets 5 Copper Screws 2 Produce Bug Fucking 20 Steel Bars 50 Gunpowder Literally Rifle Bullets Forge 50 Strike Fixed Patch Writing Npcs Fall Map Teleport Endlessly Float Sky Reach Interact Leave Restart Game Npc Pathing Smack Dab Middle Cutscene Mob Pile Softlocked Lot Scenes Character Automatically Moved Forums Planting Grid Stuck 5X5 4X4 Mode Plant Incorrectly Robot Machine Edit 5X5 Mode Game Robot Supposed Quests Triggering Fail Time Passes Events Scheduled Quests Day Day Memories 1600 Reschedule Bugs Letting Ghost Hunting Event Thinking Bug Care,POSITIVE,1,0,42,1,0.9767441860465116
2023-11-14,"if you love farming/building simulation games, you will most likely love this one. i have not even finished the game yet, but i wanted to post an honest and informative review while the game is at the height of attention. this is by far the #1 game in the genre for me. i normally do short and sweet reviews, but for a game like this i want to go over some of the important aspects of it that may make or break the players experience. so let me explain the good, the bad, and the ugly.

[b]the good[/b]:
-outstanding amount of content. you can see by my playtime that i have put in a significant amount of time. i have not even finished the main story yet, and i am not actually sure how close i am to the end. there is plenty of upgrades, levels, npc content, and building/farming to be done here

-you can have a farm with plants, chickens, buffalo, bunnies, and mounts

-there are about 20 or so romance-able npc's, all with their own character growth and story arcs along side the main story. some of them are very well done and interesting while others are not quite as fleshed out, but still enjoyable

-combat in the game is quick-paced hack-n-slash shoot-em-up style. there are ""dungeons"" to breeze through where you can get treasure, materials, and glory

-festivals are a lot of fun. you unlock more festivals as the game progresses and there are fun little mini games and unique events for each one of them.

-character creation is a bit similar to my time at portia and there are a lot of lore-friendly outfits and accessories you can use to personalize your builder. the hairstyles and coloring can be customized quite a bit to give you a unique look as well

-you can go on dates and hangout with the friends you meet in town, you can play mini games in an arcade and even mahjong at a later portion of the game.

-progression is slow but it feels great. every new house and machine upgrade you get feels like an achievement. you can upgrade your mounts, raise animals, have a huge farm, and it all feels earned. once you get more levels for your workshop and character and progress the main story you can automate collection of resources to help your progression quite a bit.

-the developers are awesome and are constantly replying to concerns and bug reports in the forums, as well as trying to improve the game.

[b]the bad[/b]:
-progression is slow. i know i stated this above, but people with not a lot of time on their hands may feel that they are not getting anywhere. a lot of this probably has a lot to do with how fast you decide to progress time. you can choose anywhere from 0.6x-3.0 time progression speed, and i believe that can have an impact on the pace of the game and how quickly it goes by. i like to take things slow and experience everything the game has to offer, so i have it set at 0.6.

-stamina and time can be hard to manage at first. you may feel a struggle early game trying to get the resources you need and finishing missions on time. this caveat goes away after getting some levels and experience under your belt. a lot of people feel a struggle at the beginning. taking the game slow is a good idea at the beginning until you get used to it.

-certain resources are very hard to get such as electronics, certain plants, trees, or animal resources. some of this stuff you need for progression but it is hard or impossible to automate in any way at the beginning. when you do commissions/missions for townsfolk, if you are not careful then you won't be able to complete them on time. this is why it is good to take it slow at the beginning and learn the ins-and-outs. this adds to early game struggle and gives a sense of not getting anywhere.

-some of the romance-able npc's don't really have much character development or story missions, decreasing their interesting aspect.

-the house building/decorating leaves much to be desired. it is difficult to place objects or know what objects to place in certain circumstances. the building ui is clunky and not user friendly. it can be struggle to get a look that you like. there are mismatched patterns or just plain ugly ones when making roofs or rooms. they honestly should have hired a color expert or interior decorator because some combinations of design can be atrocious. this part of the game is passable and you can get something that you are satisfied with, but it could take some workaround.

-workshop upgrades are incredibly expensive, to the point where you have to grind money for a long time to get room for all of the workshop add-ons, machines, and other goodies. it took me a good month of in game time to get an upgrade that would give me enough building space to extend my house because of how much money it was to get it. this part of the game feels a bit unbalanced, especially with how much money you will be spending elsewhere.

[b]the ugly[/b]
-this game is bethesda level buggy as of right now. i am not even remotely exaggerating. there are issues with npc's disappearing out of nowhere, floating mounts that you can't ride because they are stuck in the air, a visual bug that messes with some resource contracts, unclear missions markers or explanations etc.

-some missions have a timer on them. so you need to complete it in a certain number of days. there are several missions that you will fail for no reason at all with no in-game timer attached to them. these missions show no sign and give no hint of a fail-trigger, but if you don't do them then you will fail them at some point for what seems like no reason. i have had this happen a few times. this is usually with side missions. 

-you need to save a lot. there are some potentially game breaking bugs and missions you can screw up through no fault of your own, as stated above. it is a good idea to have several hard saves just in case something undesirable happens that messes up your progress with missions, npc's, or other aspects.

-the game does not run well sometimes. i get around ~60 fps pretty consistently, but certain areas, scenes, or events can cause huge framerate drops to as low as 15 fps, and i have had the game crash on me once. some people report even worse performance, but for me it is tolerable. i have a pretty decent gaming computer. i can run cyberpunk on max with a constant 60-70 fps, and this game performs slightly worse in certain cases. i will say that it seems they have ironed out some of this in the last week or so since my performance seems to have improved over the last couple days. in particular, when the train comes into town is one of the points where i get an fps drop to 15, but earlier today it did not drop when the train came in.

the game is by no means perfect, but it is my favorite game in the genre. if you liked portia or games like stardew valley, coral island, or any other popular sim games like this, then you will probably love this one. the developers are constantly looking at feedback and improving the game, so i am almost positive all of the negatives i pointed out will be fixed at some point in the future. they have already been actively releasing post-launch updates and they even intend to add more content eventually from what i have read. the developers and this game have my full confidence and support!

2023-11-14,"let's just get the important bit out of the way first: this is my 2023 game of the year. it was only a matter of when the game would come out of early access to claim its crown. since this game hit on nov. 2, i nominated it for the steam award.

now then, on to why this game is, as of this writing, my 6th most-played title in terms of hours on my steam account.

it's basically everything from my time at portia, but improved upon and made better in every possible way. the world is bigger, the building mechanics refined to a visible-from-space shine, the action rpg story fleshed out in a way that makes it the primary driver of gameplay rather than purely a framing device.

indeed, this is less a cozy game with action-rpg elements and more a reimagining of the action rpg formula where cozy game mechanics are the primary driver of progression. the genres blend seamlessly in a way that they never have before—looking at you, horizon zero dawn and forbidden west and every ubisoft game, where the crafting is tedious and feels unnecessary.

but at the same time, this game also has a cozy soul. if you're played any harvest moon-like, the life sim elements are exactly what you want them to be and then some. building relationships with villagers, romance, family life, it's all there with plenty of choices and some remarkably well-written relationship and character backstory dialogue. there are just so many ways to get a villager's friendship up compared to, say, stardew valley's more traditional talk-and-gift approach, and with the anti-frustration feature of not having to talk to every villager every day just to keep their relationship level from backsliding.

speaking of anti-frustration features, there are plenty more in this game as well. none of the main story quests are timed; complete them at your leisure. get overleveled if the combat's not your strong suit. rush the main story quests to unlock more of the crafting recipes if that's your jam. speedrunners and challenge runners? go to town, the game's got plenty of measurable ways to keep score. 

almost none of the sidequests are timed. if you unlock them too fast, as happens when you're powering through the main quest and hitting every character's sidequest trigger faster than you can bang them out, well, take a step back and take your time. the devs listened to players during the early access stage of the process and took the most common frustration—players felt rushed—out of the game. you want to complete them as fast as possible, nothing's stopping you. but it all fits in with the overarching theme of well-camouflaged accessibility that never feels like it's being dumbed down.

as for the action and combat in the action rpg, well, the devs know they're not from software. this isn't going to challenge anyone with a firm grounding in action games. you can overpower just about anything in the game because the devs have consciously avoided the bethesda syndrome of level-scaling enemies. well, with one exception—going too far afield in a sandstorm is going to surprise you the first time you run into high-level versions of basic enemies—but even that is a smart stylistic choice that makes sandstorms feel appropriately dangerous and threatening for a game set against the backdrop of a desert environment with a strong ""green aesop"" running through the main story.

is the game perfect? well, no, no game is perfect, not even games that are otherwise among the greatest of all time (i say this as someone who loved everything about red dead redemption 2 except for the on-rails quest design, for example.)

for one thing, the fishing minigame is one of the weakest i've seen in this genre. it's simplistic and repetitive and offers almost no challenge and very little reason to even engage with it beyond a couple of cooking recipes. this is a shame, especially since portia's fishing minigame was quite fun and other games like stardew, animal crossing (and dinkum, which cribs heavily from it), and even red dead 2 have great outdoorsman-style fishing gameplay.

in addition, there are a couple of dungeons in the midgame that have a jarring tonal shift toward platformer gameplay. thankfully the devs refined it a bit after its initial introduction; jumps are more forgiving, there's plenty of ""coyote time"" with ledges, and there's the option to skip the trickiest segments if you fail them enough times, but for a game that otherwise has good dungeon design, there's a heavy ""why, devs?"" when playing the two dungeons in question.

but those are minor quibbles in a game that is otherwise the absolute apex of the cozy game genre with one heck of a story rpg to go with it.

2023-11-14,"pretty full synopsis, no spoilers... except for the stupid actor part... which doesn't really spoil anything... it's the equivalent of saying, ""guy walks outside"" oh my gosh... he really did walk outside! spoilersss. i'm confident it wouldn't be the thing that kept me out of heaven by saying no spoilers...

if you liked my time at portia, you'll like this one. the controls are  basically the same with some minor differences that take getting used to. key difference i find amazing is that your storage is linked to your inventory when building, as well as most cases when giving gifts or completing quests. i found one instance where i couldn't give something in my storage and it's probably a bug. if a developer ever reads this, it was when one of the npc's was craving a ""copper plate"" i had to have it physically on me to give in that case... or maybe i'm dumb and haven't realized that all gifts must be in inventory to give and that's just a feature. in other words you don't need to spend hours organizing your storage... just throw it in and call it a day (except for clothes you want to keep... that's worth putting in it's own storage... everything else? who cares?)

relic hunting... is more exciting... maybe some won't like the change but i especially love it. instead of a giant cube room it's multiple floors of some building or something, and there are specific items you can get per floor. it makes it less of a ""find one of 50 relics which each have 2-7 pieces in this one giant room! didn't find them? well then do it all over again!"" now it's more like 5 relics per floor in a designed building that has multiple floors and start from whichever floor you want so long as you've gone deep enough to find the entrance to that floor. huge improvement in my book.

combat... i can't say about all the weapons... i started with the daggers tried, the others once, i love the daggers.... call me thorfin. 

combat is pretty similar to the old game, but just better. from armor breaking/staggering, to varying stats on the same item because of it's quality, which can range from low, to perfect, and then there's rare, which adds some cool features.... whether it's crafting, buying or finding. the items are all much more exciting in this game.

i was disappointed.... that everything feels mostly the same as the original game, but happy it's better. you're basically getting the same game but part two. 

the dialogue is mostly skipable, with the occasional choose your response, in which cases i regret not reading the dialogue... buuuut 95% of the time... totally skipable. unless i'm in a reading mood, i find it average, and occasionally good.

cut scenes.... are extremely lacking... it's like a low quality first time actor playing a major roll in a lead film, and the director says after each scene, ""cut.. that's a wrap... send it to production."" when they should've said, ""cut! that sucks! what are you doing! you're entering a scene where all the monsters are already gone, you've just barely shown up, and then you do a front roll into the room... from the middle of the room... you then aim your pistol, stand up, smile doing a finger spin with the pistol... catch it, blow the smoke off the tip of the pistol, when there is no smoke, because you haven't fired a single shot?... are you stupid? did you take acting lessons from stupid school? did you graduate top of your stupid class with stupid honors? because that was pretty stupid!""

now if they added a character to come in and say those exact words to that silly dude who did all those things... then it would've been hilarious, and we all would've understood... that's the stupid guy... but no, every cut scene is pretty much like that.

i love the game... plenty to make fun of, and critique, but that doesn't stop me from loving it. leave a comment/question if you have any specific inquiries.

dlc worth it?..... you aren't missing anything by not buying any of the dlc items... sure they'll give you a nice head start, but even though i had them i found myself not using any of them because i like starting a game with nothing and then building up to something awesome. if you're the same, save yourself a few bucks, otherwise if you just want some gear for some different looks, then maybe you'll like it.

character creation.... well at least you won't look like you have down syndrome in the game... unless that's what you're going for i'm sure you can pull it off!!! there is a major improvement on the quality of character in the creation tab... but i just want more!!! 

you really don't have a lot of options, and they don't leave you thinking, ""that character i made looks so bad a!!!"" it's more of a, ""well... i guess that's as good as it gets."" i liked how mine turned out, but it took 3 hours of messing around with every possibility, starting and deleting 3 games (the character never looks exactly the same in the game play)...before i finally got to ""my guy looks really kind of okay!""

(example... i put lipstic and changed the coloring on my guy to make him look like he had actual lips... not feminine lips... just dude lips... i get into the game... feminine af! deleted, and then did the same thing except made the lipstick lighter than what looked good... in the gameplay it looked pretty good. i mean.....i'm the equivalent of brad freaking pitt in this character creation screen! i look so good! kindof... joking aside i was happy with the final result. i can't say whether it's the same for making a girl since i didn't try.)

2023-11-12,"[h1] my time at sandrock: an amazingly massive game, a great story line, and some occasional faults. ~ [/h1]

[h3] okay, so i have obviously played this game a lot, and it's because it is that good! if you're a return player from portia, i can confirm to you that sandrock is a massive upgrade in almost all aspects! if you have never played a game in the my time at series, don't worry! you absolutely do not have to play portia to enjoy sandrock! after over 200 hours of game play, here's my major takeaways ~ [/h3]

[u] the great ~ [/u] 

[b] the story line [/b]
- sandrock has a really great main story quest line, with enough twist and turns to keep you interested and immersed. it truly was a pleasure to play through it! there's a good mix of resource gathering, social aspects, combat, farming, and advancement required that keeps you motivated to continue grinding towards completion. also, if you're a return player from portia, i personally believe that sandrock has a better story line, and has increased difficulty.
[b] the characters [/b]
- wow! sandrock truly has some very colorful characters! without giving anything away, these side characters have a variety of personalities that are genuinely fun to interact with. in a lot of other games from this genre i tend to stop talking to a lot of the npcs around town, but i actually like hearing what the characters in sandrock have to say! it also helps that every character is given new unique dialogue after progress in the story is made, so they're not just constantly spouting the same lines all the time, regardless of development. there's a lot of great romance options as well, with there being someone for everyone. 
[b] the dialogue [/b]
- there's no other way to say this ~ this game just has straight up hilarious lines! from a farmer who's a part-time conspiracy theorist to a rock obsessed wannabe deputy, there's no shortage of great lines from the characters around the game. the dialogue also makes you want to befriend more of the citizens to see their extra events because of how hilarious they can be. your player character can even give some golden one-liners as the game progresses! 
[b] the grind [/b] 
- you really have to get involved in all aspects of the game when playing. you're going to need a lot of wood to complete projects, i mean, you are a builder. however, sandrock is desolate and cutting down trees and cacti is a big no-no. this means you have to cut down tiny bushes, dead logs, etc. which do not give you a lot of resources, meaning you've got to keep at the grind! also, as you unlock more areas and more of the story, you find yourself having to go back to previous ruins/areas in order to get different types of materials, as they're not in the same place. don't forget that water powers all of your machines, so you have to keep your tank full in the middle of the desert! 

[u] the lacking~ [/u]

[b] the family issue [/b]
- in short, because there's so many elements in sandrock, they eventually fizzle out in unsatisfactory ways. a good example can be seen with married and family life, which is just not fleshed out enough. considering characters around the game continuously sing praises towards your character, and comment on the various things going on around, it's strange that basically nobody acknowledges your spouse and children. so far, there's no family events, and once your children exit the baby stage, you literally never see them interact with anyone, including your spouse. they wake up and essentially go to one place (the train station) for the entire day.  it would've been nice to have them as actual members of the town, with their own events as they age, and a routine that mimics other npcs. as for your spouse, the married events currently in game are very boring and out of place for some characters. i would really love to see married life and family life be more fleshed out in the future, whether in another my time game, or in an expansion/update! i would rather have less romance options and just one child if that means that the additional content that comes with them would be stronger. 
[b] character favoritism + strange depth [/b]
- it's very obvious that, because of fan reception, some characters are more favored than others. by this i mean that they have way more content. take fang and logan as an example. both characters are fan favorites, and they have some really cool events! these events also work really well with what has been presented with their characters, which gives not only their characters, but the game, more depth. it really makes you believe that they had a life before you, and have a life despite you. i suppose this makes me more critical of the other characters in the game. director qi is a good example of this. you actually get to know so much about his character! for example, he's the grandson of a successful scientist who appears to be very strict, his parent's had more ""lowly"" jobs in comparison and qi appears to sort of look down on them, and he even states that his parents were shocked to find out that you exist (if you romance him), and that when he was younger he calculated that there was only a 3.14% chance of him finding love. these all combine to create such an interesting character, and gives you a plethora of ideas of how his character will/can progress. however, despite these tidbits that you can gather, that's basically it. his character, as well as a large portion of characters in the game, plateau. this is what i mean about strange depth, it's like they had more planned for certain characters, and it just never came to fruition. i was so certain when romancing qi's character that there was going to be some really cool events regarding his past, him falling in love with you, having children of his own, etc., and it just never happened. it honestly was a big disappointment because i saw all the makings of a great side story for a lot of the romance-able characters, but it's just not there. 

[h3] in conclusion, i honestly feel like i have so much more to say, which isn't surprising considering how much i loved the game. additionally, i would say that because i love the game and series so much i am probably more critical of it in certain ways! i think that's truly the hallmark sign of a great game, liking it so much that you want to make certain changes to perfect it! all in all, sandrock was truly an amazing experience and i would recommend it to all lovers of the genre. however, keep in mind that there are going to be aspects of the game that will leave you frustrated. these frustrations, at least for me, have a lot to do with the fact that i just want more! keep it up devs! you're doing great sweeties, and the improvement from portia is massive!

2023-11-11,"overall, i recommend the game - 480 hours played across early release - but that doesn't mean the game is perfect. much has been made of the voiceover issues with this game, so i'll bypass those, other than to add that changing the voiceover artist for later updates compounded the issue.

it's less clunky (although arguable less realistic, as a consequence) than its predecessor, my time at portia, which may make for a less than satisfying experience for anyone who chooses to play that game after this one. the characters in sandrock are less bobble-headed, too, which is an improvement. portia and sandrock happen in a simultaneous timelime, which leads to some quietly-amusing references to, effectively, your portia character at points during sandrock, another reason to consider playing portia first.

of the five bachelors i romanced, three of them exhibited behaviour that, in real life, should set major alarm bells ringing, which is quite concerning. a couple of the npcs are genuinely unlikeable, which is fine and reflective of real life; but i found myself resenting completing lucrative contracts for one of them by late game, as their relationship with me continued to increase even as my loathing of them grew.

as i did play this through early release, some things may have changed by full release, but a few niggly annoyances stood out: at times, lucrative commissions for machinery would appear on the commission board; but without having any in-game ability to know what was required to complete construction, it was quite frustrating to accept these commissions, research the manufacturing plans, discover you needed more advanced equipment yourself, research that, then find that you needed components you either didn't have materials for, or didn't have the ability to make. in one instance, the 'base' instructions for making the refined material i needed to make one component didn't even become available until nearly two months after i'd failed the commission. if the capacity to complete the commission doesn't exist, don't make it available.

secondly, there were times when it became impossible to complete tasks because the final act clashed with some other event. some of these may have since been resolved. in a related annoyance, there are times when the pc wakes up with awareness of events it is literally impossible for them to have any knowledge of. often this is minor: calendar events added on rising in the morning that are explained when mail is read. occasionally, however, these are quite significant. just as bed, there are some events involving npcs that clearly acknowledge the passage of a significant period of time (a minimum two weeks would be essential in one case), yet those events conclude within a day or so. then there is the issue of being 'transported' to major events when you get up. on one occasion, running back home after such an event, i encountered a minor task simply by talking with an npc that i had no means of answering because the task was outlined in a letter i hadn't yet had a chance to read. more concerningly, the non-committal answer i gave may have broken the character, who never moved from the spot i encountered him for the remainder of the game, unless needed elsewhere.

the nanny-nag that says ""you can't use that possibly rude word!"" when naming things in single-player is both ludicrous and offensive: i'm an adult, not six years old, and i can make my own decisions. if it's important that any vaguely-implied rudeness must be leapt on with extreme prejudice, then i would suggest that eliminating toxic behaviours from a multitude of npcs would be a better use of censorship - especially if (and i am forced to assume that this must be the case) the game makers are trying to avoid corrupting sweet childish innocence.

similarly, an in-game swimwear fashion show basically designed to sell dlcs is both sexist and cowardly in dressing the female models in bikins and the males in shorts. the game designers may have jumped on the 'it's okay to be gay"" bandwagon; but their moral code is severely lacking in other areas (most particularly regarding toxic behaviours).

one in-game shop has a link to actual character figurines on amazon: if you follow the link you find that you're being asked to pay an offensively-large amount of money for a blind-box figurine, so that's a definitive 'no' on both counts. still, that annoyance is easily-avoided, although it does make me less-inclined to consider buying other pathea games products, up to and including dlcs, so they may like to rethink their approach.

yes, i have concentrated on the negatives in this review. on the positive side, the game is immensely-playable. for an obsessive such as me, there is always something to do, with the essential wait-times scattered throughout the game usually not too much of a trial. some npcs are clearly on the autism spectrum, and this is treated respectfully (albeit occasionally with not-unreasonable impatience) by other npcs and player choices, which is to be commended. apart from some built-in sexism, the character design is generally appealing, and the capacity to 'hide the hat' via the settings is appreciated: having put a lot of effort into designing my character, i like being able to see them. the storylines are often engaging, although i wish the character-based relationship-building tasks had a time expiry if unselected, because having them sit constantly on the map when i have no interest in following them through is annoying.

in summary, an enjoyable, very playable game with a number of flaws, some of them significant.",18231,Recommend Game 480 Hours Played Release Game Perfect Voiceover Issues Game Bypass Add Changing Voiceover Artist Updates Compounded Issue Clunky Arguable Realistic Consequence Predecessor Time Portia Satisfying Experience Chooses Play Game Characters Sandrock Bobble Headed Improvement Portia Sandrock Happen Simultaneous Timelime Leads Quietly Amusing References Effectively Portia Character Sandrock Reason Playing Portia Bachelors Romanced Exhibited Behaviour Real Life Set Major Alarm Bells Ringing Couple Npcs Genuinely Unlikeable Fine Reflective Real Life Resenting Completing Lucrative Contracts Late Game Relationship Continued Increase Loathing Grew Play Release Changed Release Niggly Annoyances Stood Times Lucrative Commissions Machinery Commission Board Game Ability Required Complete Construction Frustrating Accept Commissions Manufacturing Plans Discover Advanced Equipment Components Materials Ability Instance Base Instructions Refined Material Component Months Failed Commission Capacity Complete Commission Exist Times Impossible Complete Tasks Final Clashed Event Resolved Annoyance Times Pc Wakes Awareness Events Literally Impossible Knowledge Minor Calendar Events Rising Morning Explained Mail Read Occasionally Bed Events Involving Npcs Acknowledge Passage Period Time Minimum Weeks Essential Events Conclude Day Issue Transported Major Events Occasion Running Event Encountered Minor Task Simply Talking Npc Answering Task Outlined Letter Chance Read Concerningly Committal Answer Broken Character Moved Spot Encountered Remainder Game Nanny Nag Rude Word Naming Single Player Ludicrous Offensive Adult Decisions Vaguely Implied Rudeness Leapt Extreme Prejudice Eliminating Toxic Behaviours Multitude Npcs Censorship Forced Assume Game Makers Avoid Corrupting Sweet Childish Innocence Game Swimwear Fashion Basically Designed Sell Dlcs Sexist Cowardly Dressing Female Models Bikins Males Shorts Game Designers Jumped Gay Bandwagon Moral Code Severely Lacking Toxic Behaviours Game Shop Link Actual Character Figurines Amazon Follow Link Pay Offensively Money Blind Box Figurine Definitive Counts Annoyance Easily Avoided Inclined Buying Pathea Games Products Including Dlcs Rethink Approach Concentrated Negatives Review Positive Game Immensely Playable Obsessive Essential Wait Times Scattered Game Trial Npcs Autism Spectrum Treated Respectfully Albeit Occasionally Unreasonable Impatience Npcs Player Choices Commended Built Sexism Character Design Appealing Capacity Hide Hat Settings Appreciated Lot Effort Designing Character Storylines Engaging Character Based Relationship Building Tasks Time Expiry Unselected Sit Constantly Map Annoying Summary Enjoyable Playable Game Flaws,POSITIVE,1,0,53,15,0.7794117647058824
2023-11-11,"having played portia, and having played this a bit while in ea, i can definitively say that this is a straight upgrade in many ways compared to the previous game and that time spent in ea was well spent to make a generally well-polished experience on release. 

the thing that stood out to me as vastly improved in comparison to portia is the combat, which, for a game that has utilized this mechanic in a more intimate way that other farming/building/life simulation games, i think really nails the good balance in necessity to being enjoyable to engage with. especially when you start upgrading the combat skills, getting more combos, getting the flow of the enemy actions and dodging and timing strikes, while not particularly profound, still feels enjoyable and far more engaging than the previous games and others in the same genre i've experienced. it feels simple enough though that even if you're not really playing this game to partake in the combat-portion of the game, it's easy enough to out-level the enemies by performing other tasks that simple button mashing to get the mats you need from lower level monsters won't pose much of an obstacle.

outside of combat, i've always enjoyed the commission system in both games, and i think it serves well here for giving yourself a sense of progression and direction. while being rewarding enough that, while being somewhat repetitive in what you'll be building for the various residents of sandrock, serves more as the foundation for pursuing other enjoyable ventures like upgrading your workshop, buying mats that you need either directly at stores or commissioning deliveries while giving you enough of a reward in not only the money you need, but additional materials and easy relationship improvements outside of the, arguably, rather shallow and repetitive npc conversational engagements quickly enough to give you variety in other things to do without feeling like too much of a grind.

the story is also rather cute, if not a bit on the simple side, which imo, is fine for what it is - it gives you a further sense of purpose and a meaningful way to progress unlockable areas, residents, and mechanics. i feel several of the npcs have notable quirks that make them memorable enough to want to engage with them and their missions, although at times, even with the characters that are not designed to be long-winded (like cooper), i found myself wanting to read the dialog faster than i wanted to hear it from them because there's just something about the way they talk and the flow that just made me frequently want to skip it. can't really put my finger on why exactly, but this was especially true when interacting with them daily during the regular chat interactions. with that said though, one really nice touch is how npcs all have their own individual reactions to story events that are enjoyable to listen to, even if they can be a bit long-winded sometimes. it's a nice touch to detail that somewhat makes your accomplishments in the game feel more relevant to your place in the world.

lastly, while i haven't played much of it since ea, the multiplayer seems way more polished (and was non-existent in the previous game) and has been pretty fun so far. if you've got friends to play with, while it's completely separate from the base instance of the game, the co-op workspace and co-op commissions and being able to engage in spelunking and combat with friends gives it a fresh feel from the base, single-player, portion of the game.

[h3][u]tl:dr[/u][/h3]
- solid improvement from the previous game in almost every way.
- combat improvements especially feel much better from previous games.
- story is fine, albeit a bit on the simple side. more focus made on the mechanics.
- many npcs are memorable in their own way if not a bit long-winded and the base chat mechanic is a bit bleh but the ""play"" mechanics make up for it a bit (albeit, get a bit repetitive with the limited options and expensive energy costs to engage in them). 
- multiplayer is a separate instance from the base, single-player, game, but having all the same mechanics being applied while playing with friends has, so far, been a very enjoyable experience and is way more polished than when it was introduced in ea.",18231,Played Portia Played Bit Ea Definitively Straight Upgrade Compared Previous Game Time Spent Ea Spent Polished Experience Release Stood Vastly Improved Comparison Portia Combat Game Utilized Mechanic Intimate Farming Building Life Simulation Games Nails Balance Necessity Enjoyable Engage Start Upgrading Combat Skills Combos Flow Enemy Actions Dodging Timing Strikes Profound Feels Enjoyable Engaging Previous Games Genre Experienced Feels Simple Playing Game Partake Combat Portion Game Easy Level Enemies Performing Tasks Simple Button Mashing Mats Level Monsters Pose Obstacle Combat Enjoyed Commission Games Serves Sense Progression Direction Rewarding Repetitive Building Residents Sandrock Serves Foundation Pursuing Enjoyable Ventures Upgrading Workshop Buying Mats Stores Commissioning Deliveries Reward Money Additional Materials Easy Relationship Improvements Arguably Shallow Repetitive Npc Conversational Engagements Variety Feeling Grind Story Cute Bit Simple Imo Fine Sense Purpose Meaningful Progress Unlockable Residents Mechanics Feel Npcs Notable Quirks Memorable Engage Missions Times Characters Designed Winded Cooper Read Dialog Faster Hear Talk Flow Frequently Skip Finger True Interacting Daily Regular Chat Interactions Nice Touch Npcs Individual Reactions Story Events Enjoyable Listen Bit Winded Nice Touch Accomplishments Game Feel Relevant Lastly Played Ea Multiplayer Polished Existent Previous Game Pretty Fun Friends Play Completely Separate Base Instance Game Op Workspace Op Commissions Engage Spelunking Combat Friends Fresh Feel Base Single Player Portion Game H3 Tl Dr H3 Solid Improvement Previous Game Combat Improvements Feel Previous Games Story Fine Albeit Bit Simple Focus Mechanics Npcs Memorable Bit Winded Base Chat Mechanic Bit Bleh Play Mechanics Bit Albeit Bit Repetitive Limited Options Expensive Energy Costs Engage Multiplayer Separate Instance Base Single Player Game Mechanics Applied Playing Friends Enjoyable Experience Polished Introduced Ea,POSITIVE,1,0,53,15,0.7794117647058824

if you loved my time at portia, or in general you like chilled crafting/farming/mining and doing quests in your own pace, then you will love my time at sandrock too! 

long version: i am playing since the game was in early access (didn't have too much time back then, but i am starting now to put more time into it), and the game has improved a lot with the recent release and the devs are always fixing and adding stuff. i am sure i will spend many more hours as the storyline goes on, as there are always many things to do and you never get bored.  
i did not face any bugs/issues myself until now.
the only hurdle was in the beginning of the game to figure out the whole water/fuel situation for the machines (it took me a while to get the whole system and i was a bit frustrated back then, but i am glad i came back and figured it out). it could be that i missed something on my end/things are easier now. 

plus point: we have the option for multiplayer! i haven't tried it yet, but i am excited to do so with my friends!
