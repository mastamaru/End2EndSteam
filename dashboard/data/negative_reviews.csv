2023-11-11,"do not buy, extremely buggy game.

i really enjoyed my time at portia (mtap), and found that sandrock (mtas) has extended much of the gameplay. the interaction system is fine, and the crafting system is basically identical. most of the game is good (hence my recent post-release play of ~90 hours (~20hrs was during the beta)). the fishing is so much better in mtas, it's a great improvement.

however, as the game goes on, more and more bugs arise. i've found that the game starts to chug after long play sessions (5+hrs) and needs to be restarted just to transition between scenes more smoothly. i've had several days where the game just hangs because when you leave your house in the morning it's supposed to cut to a cutscene, but the cutscene doesn't start, and so the game just sits on a black screen. sometimes restarting the game helped, otherwise i had to restart my computer (this indicates that mtas isn't releasing resources it finished using).

on the non-bugs front: the dialogue is often just bad. while i don't mean characters like unsuur who are just intentionally odd (and pretty funny), the entire bronco the kid arc is just immensely painful to play through. i appreciate that this was probably attempting to be silly, it's just a conversation that actual humans would never have with each other.

there are a lot of ""popins"" = graphics that just 'pop' into existence, but should have been there beforehand. exiting a building (eg the museum) leaves you standing outside an empty lot until the game loads in the building. this is not a modern fps, a quick look at the sceenshots will quickly show that the graphics in this game are very basic, no dlss in sight. yet buildings (and people) are often loaded in very slowly, taking 2-3 seconds to fully load each time you fast travel. this seems small until you realise that you will be fast travelling multiple times per day, every day, so this issue is constantly in your face.

npcs don't exist in the world. or rather, they do until they need to be somewhere else, and then they teleport. one of the things that i enjoyed in mtap was watching the townsfolk sprint across town to get to a gathering. in addition to being fun to watch, it also meant you could intercept them during their schedule to interact with them. this largely doesn't happen any more, they're simply teleported to where they need to be. this, frankly, is just absolute garbage, and leads to a bunch of issues.

an example: heidi and i are married in the game, and i have a quest to give her an item. according to my map, she's at the game centre, so i hop on my horse and head over there. as i approach the games centre, the quest marker jumps back to my workshop: she's there to pick up all the completed items from my machine. so i turnaround and head back to my workshop. as i pass the train station, the quest marker jumps *back* to the game centre: heidi finished her workshop tasks, and her schedule has her at the games centre so she teleports again.

in mtap, i would have met heidi on her way, but in mtas it's impossible.

in addition to that, npcs will just randomly teleport around. if you hang around the main square in front of the town hall, justice and trudy will just randomly materialise there. this is an entirely reasonable thing to do if npcs get stuck on objects, but 1) it's happening all the goddamn time, and 2) coco gets stuck on objects in my workshop all the time, yet never teleports.

this is before we talk about a game-breaking bug that has halted my current play. two events were supposed to occur on two different days, but the first didn't trigger on the correct day, so now they've both blended and are happening at the same time. this has caused the game to lose its sh~t, and spin my camera out into the desert, where it just sits and ignores all input from me.

all in all, this game is riddled with bugs, and has serious foundational flaws in its design. i bought this game in early access on the strength of mtap, and (frankly) i regret doing so.

2023-11-10,"this game is enjoyable... it's better than my time at portia, but only barely. the writing is genuinely good and voice acting is great. the characters themselves look great as well. inventory is improved but i am not sure that warrants immense praise in a sequel, i would expect more mechanical improvements. the characters are definitely more demanding and engaged. some times i wish they would honestly shove off though, a lot of them are deeply self centered and narcissistic. it's an attempt to show a more realistic community i guess, but so many of them track anti-social and deeply narcissistic that i am not sure who i actually like in the town. kudos i guess on making it feel like i really am in a backwater trash town.

but i waited a long time for it to leave early access, and now i am playing a game that still feels like it is in early access. 

additionally, level design feels very strange. the over world feels janky and the dungeons half baked in design. a lot of areas blocked by invisible walls and lazy graphics.

the town itself is not particularly impressive and walking away from locations feels like i am walking on an unfinished map. many locations are deeply confusing to find and there are many absolutely pointless time wasting caves that have absolutely nothing in them except maybe a chest that drops a pointless piece of loot.

enemy's feel buggy and some of them are massively annoying to fight with a melee weapon. hyena's jump and move constantly, rat men spawn in the air and can't be attacked. combat is definitely more engineered from portia but it doesn't necessarily feel better chasing around a enemy that essentially non-stop roll dodges.

the denizens look better, but you look like a carnival clown. why are we still throwing utility pouches on things like they are 90s super heroes? why can't anyone make a decent pare of pants, i'm tired of running around in ill fitting shorts. i feel like you should be able to reskin the armor in the game to others you have unlocked. maybe that is a thing but it isn't apparent.

----

response to developer:
there are several instances where the corners of the paradise lost (i believe, first combat dungeon) has areas that look traversable that aren't. the fence going into paradise lost looks scalable. walking into the gecko station there is a large dead space around the entrance that can't be walked through, you have to approach the station entrance straight on dead center to enter. aside from that there are several areas that just seems empty though accessible including caves with little reward for exploring them. feels more like i am punished for exploring in a game at least partial about time management, i now default look up a guide the second i am confused. often the guide itself is confused like in the case with of the quest ""whispers of the heart"" where the streamer enters the cave thinking it might be where the quest location is. understandable since heidi appears to lead you there but then disappears (got stuck on terrain in my game) teleportating to the location but with no quest marker except a zone on the map. a quest with no timer listed but which logically does need to be completed that day and fails if not completed.

speaking of quests that need to be completed on time, there are a ton that auto trigger by walking into zones and they can overlap with other quests you have happening. perhaps you designed this to encourage players to not do quests saving them for future playthrough, but i don't think the majority of your users do play the game more than once. games this scale are huge timesinks and i would like to not decline side plot character arc stuff simply because i have 3 of them going simultaneously.the pacing of quests simply doesn't feel in line with the default speed of the game. i understand i can adjust this but i would like the game at least defaulting to an optimal experience. this likely goes into my feelings towards the townfolk being off putting, berating me with quests that really seem like they should be commissions (owen being the biggest offender though also not being told to stop like the others).

after experiencing the combat more i think the problem is the lack of mobility in the main character during a fight. you feel dark souls speed while everyone else (non-duel) feels like they are playing an arcade beat-em up.

i realize now there is a wardrobe tab, not sure how i missed it. apologies for that criticism. now i can wear my button up (with strange disco medalion/compass) and pants like a normie.

i think some of my irritation is the above mentioned side quest pacing. a lot of characters don't really grow much and feel very one sided in their relationship with you, qi in particular is deeply narcissistic and so central to the plot. there are definitely great characters but the ones who have big character flaws very rarely if ever showcase anything redeeming. would be satisfying to be able to get back at yan even a little and i have been playing the game for an in game year. arvio really needs to not be a screw up once in a while. amirah has 0 warmth even after being stuck making 50 fireworks for an event no one shows up to she responds to with a trailing ellipsis. i mean what is the player expectation here? if it's just the clique getting together to watch fireworks than why not have that happen? if it's a setup for a date why does amirah respond to even the most mild show of affection with a trailing ellipsis? how long do you want me to humor this fleeting youth club when they don't show up to their own events and, if it's a romance line, don't seem interested in you? i feel like i am doing a huge number of quests just to up relationship points, not because i enjoy them.

when's justice going to not be a failure riding off others? i'd love him to show some reason why anyone would want him as sheriff. miguel is a psycho. fang drugs me for his own amusement.

final complaint, clay and bloodstone are deeply relied on for commissions. they are very difficult to source without going back to the first dungeon or buying some from a store behind a loading screen. i have so much stone and sand at this point i could forge another sandrock in an effort to source clay and bloodstone and this is with me having built up a ton of bloodstone building a ridiculous field of moisture farms and needing the marble (p.s. please let us automate collection from these or something...).

i see why this game could make a good first impression to people who never heard of pathea and their games before. graphics and npcs are nice to look at. unfortunately, that’s all.  

gameplay 3/10
difficulty 2/10
graphics 6/10
audio 3/10
story 1/10
sensitivity when it comes to serious topics (trauma, disabilities, death) 0/10
dev support 0/10
false promises 10/10

there sure were lots of problems with their previous game, my time at portia, devs simply weren’t capable to handle resources and promised way too much. the result was and still is an unpolished game full of bugs and missing content for several dateable npcs. console ports are still a mess too, although team17 and pingle are out for several years now and it was all up to pathea after this. last update in 2021 caused more problems than it solved and even more than 2 years later, pathea did nothing but announce some switch performance update. no actual update, no word about problems like missing items, stuck npcs, unplayable missions or fixes for playstation or xbox. they abandoned both, pc and console ports to work on sandrock instead.

there were many promises to learn from previous mistakes with portia and that everything would get better with sandrock. spoiler; [spoiler]it did not.[/spoiler] 

as other negative reviews already pointed out; sandrock kickstarter ended up being a scam.
many people backed because of 100k multiplayer stretch goal, which was easily reached. during early access the multiplayer actually did have story content for a while, just as devs promised. later, they suddenly decided to backtrack and removed it. their excuse; once more bit off more than they could chew and backers just have to accept this. no content, no chance for refund. 

there were more false promises during and after kickstarter. some examples;
- announced timespan for backers to share exclusive content was shortened
- all dateable npcs getting same amount of content - no, it ended up being the same as in mtap
- fixing none working kickstarter dlc codes - not for me
- promise to fix sensitive content - no

even if ignoring all of these mentioned above, i can still not recommend this game. devs took their previous game mtap, added desert location, more generic graphics, some new features and a different writing style. 

while simple gameplay and low difficulty are quite fitting for this genre, their storytelling is unbearable. memes, movie quotes, references, breaking the 4th wall, primitive thirst traps and puns galore, devs admitting at discord to copy entire npcs from disney and others. a ref or joke once in a while is nice though it’s far too much in this case. sandrock feels more like a parody or browsing social media rather than diving into a game with reliable npcs. also, very often those jokes are out of place or go way too far. for example;[spoiler]
- fake kidnapping a traumatized man’s pet to get his attention
- some npc pretending to be disabled because being too lazy to work 
- npc, who is worried their family member might die after already losing another one, is portrayed as fire spitting monster
- making corpulent npc a joke by adding ridiculous amount of food to his room[/spoiler]

devs also came up with the weirdest excuses for missing quality. like saying not to add optional (lol) voice acting for main character because they don’t want to limit players’ vision of their avatar too much. well, they actually don’t mind limiting our vision by bringing mc’s parents and childhood friend to the game, which of course is a way bigger limitation. 

writers are showing a huge lack in sensitivity and even made fun of some players at reddit and discord who brought up their sincere concerns. this behavior is mostly unprofessional.

writing also suffers from missing consistency; plot, timeline, even entire npcs. especially recurring npcs from mtap. [spoiler]mint’s whole backstory and childhood were changed to promote qi, ginger became implausible careless, not following doctors’ advices anymore, gale prioritizes rather meaningless daily work over his precious daughter and leaves her behind, while the formerly cold, detached and standoffish gust now is loud, unjustifiably aggressive and violent to make players sympathize with director’s favorite npc fang, who is permanently portrayed as everyone’s victim.[/spoiler] which leads to another problem; playing favorites. if you’re not interested in sad novel trope fang or stereotype himbo logan, be aware your favorite npc doesn’t get much content since writers focus on those two heavily.

i gave pathea a chance and wanted to support their growth. there’s nothing wrong with making mistakes if you’re willing to learn from them and show process. quite disappointing, this isn’t the case with pathea and sandrock. same mistakes all over again and even adding new ones. this is why i can’t recommend this game.

2023-11-10,"this game is enjoyable... it's better than my time at portia, but only barely. the writing is genuinely good and voice acting is great. the characters themselves look great as well. inventory is improved but i am not sure that warrants immense praise in a sequel, i would expect more mechanical improvements. the characters are definitely more demanding and engaged. some times i wish they would honestly shove off though, a lot of them are deeply self centered and narcissistic. it's an attempt to show a more realistic community i guess, but so many of them track anti-social and deeply narcissistic that i am not sure who i actually like in the town. kudos i guess on making it feel like i really am in a backwater trash town.

but i waited a long time for it to leave early access, and now i am playing a game that still feels like it is in early access. 

additionally, level design feels very strange. the over world feels janky and the dungeons half baked in design. a lot of areas blocked by invisible walls and lazy graphics.

the town itself is not particularly impressive and walking away from locations feels like i am walking on an unfinished map. many locations are deeply confusing to find and there are many absolutely pointless time wasting caves that have absolutely nothing in them except maybe a chest that drops a pointless piece of loot.

enemy's feel buggy and some of them are massively annoying to fight with a melee weapon. hyena's jump and move constantly, rat men spawn in the air and can't be attacked. combat is definitely more engineered from portia but it doesn't necessarily feel better chasing around a enemy that essentially non-stop roll dodges.

the denizens look better, but you look like a carnival clown. why are we still throwing utility pouches on things like they are 90s super heroes? why can't anyone make a decent pare of pants, i'm tired of running around in ill fitting shorts. i feel like you should be able to reskin the armor in the game to others you have unlocked. maybe that is a thing but it isn't apparent.

speaking of quests that need to be completed on time, there are a ton that auto trigger by walking into zones and they can overlap with other quests you have happening. perhaps you designed this to encourage players to not do quests saving them for future playthrough, but i don't think the majority of your users do play the game more than once. games this scale are huge timesinks and i would like to not decline side plot character arc stuff simply because i have 3 of them going simultaneously.the pacing of quests simply doesn't feel in line with the default speed of the game. i understand i can adjust this but i would like the game at least defaulting to an optimal experience. this likely goes into my feelings towards the townfolk being off putting, berating me with quests that really seem like they should be commissions (owen being the biggest offender though also not being told to stop like the others).

after experiencing the combat more i think the problem is the lack of mobility in the main character during a fight. you feel dark souls speed while everyone else (non-duel) feels like they are playing an arcade beat-em up.

i realize now there is a wardrobe tab, not sure how i missed it. apologies for that criticism. now i can wear my button up (with strange disco medalion/compass) and pants like a normie.

i think some of my irritation is the above mentioned side quest pacing. a lot of characters don't really grow much and feel very one sided in their relationship with you, qi in particular is deeply narcissistic and so central to the plot. there are definitely great characters but the ones who have big character flaws very rarely if ever showcase anything redeeming. would be satisfying to be able to get back at yan even a little and i have been playing the game for an in game year. arvio really needs to not be a screw up once in a while. amirah has 0 warmth even after being stuck making 50 fireworks for an event no one shows up to she responds to with a trailing ellipsis. i mean what is the player expectation here? if it's just the clique getting together to watch fireworks than why not have that happen? if it's a setup for a date why does amirah respond to even the most mild show of affection with a trailing ellipsis? how long do you want me to humor this fleeting youth club when they don't show up to their own events and, if it's a romance line, don't seem interested in you? i feel like i am doing a huge number of quests just to up relationship points, not because i enjoy them.

2023-11-11,"do not buy, extremely buggy game.

i really enjoyed my time at portia (mtap), and found that sandrock (mtas) has extended much of the gameplay. the interaction system is fine, and the crafting system is basically identical. most of the game is good (hence my recent post-release play of ~90 hours (~20hrs was during the beta)). the fishing is so much better in mtas, it's a great improvement.

however, as the game goes on, more and more bugs arise. i've found that the game starts to chug after long play sessions (5+hrs) and needs to be restarted just to transition between scenes more smoothly. i've had several days where the game just hangs because when you leave your house in the morning it's supposed to cut to a cutscene, but the cutscene doesn't start, and so the game just sits on a black screen. sometimes restarting the game helped, otherwise i had to restart my computer (this indicates that mtas isn't releasing resources it finished using).

on the non-bugs front: the dialogue is often just bad. while i don't mean characters like unsuur who are just intentionally odd (and pretty funny), the entire bronco the kid arc is just immensely painful to play through. i appreciate that this was probably attempting to be silly, it's just a conversation that actual humans would never have with each other.

there are a lot of ""popins"" = graphics that just 'pop' into existence, but should have been there beforehand. exiting a building (eg the museum) leaves you standing outside an empty lot until the game loads in the building. this is not a modern fps, a quick look at the sceenshots will quickly show that the graphics in this game are very basic, no dlss in sight. yet buildings (and people) are often loaded in very slowly, taking 2-3 seconds to fully load each time you fast travel. this seems small until you realise that you will be fast travelling multiple times per day, every day, so this issue is constantly in your face.

npcs don't exist in the world. or rather, they do until they need to be somewhere else, and then they teleport. one of the things that i enjoyed in mtap was watching the townsfolk sprint across town to get to a gathering. in addition to being fun to watch, it also meant you could intercept them during their schedule to interact with them. this largely doesn't happen any more, they're simply teleported to where they need to be. this, frankly, is just absolute garbage, and leads to a bunch of issues.

an example: heidi and i are married in the game, and i have a quest to give her an item. according to my map, she's at the game centre, so i hop on my horse and head over there. as i approach the games centre, the quest marker jumps back to my workshop: she's there to pick up all the completed items from my machine. so i turnaround and head back to my workshop. as i pass the train station, the quest marker jumps *back* to the game centre: heidi finished her workshop tasks, and her schedule has her at the games centre so she teleports again.

in mtap, i would have met heidi on her way, but in mtas it's impossible.

in addition to that, npcs will just randomly teleport around. if you hang around the main square in front of the town hall, justice and trudy will just randomly materialise there. this is an entirely reasonable thing to do if npcs get stuck on objects, but 1) it's happening all the goddamn time, and 2) coco gets stuck on objects in my workshop all the time, yet never teleports.

this is before we talk about a game-breaking bug that has halted my current play. two events were supposed to occur on two different days, but the first didn't trigger on the correct day, so now they've both blended and are happening at the same time. this has caused the game to lose its sh~t, and spin my camera out into the desert, where it just sits and ignores all input from me.

all in all, this game is riddled with bugs, and has serious foundational flaws in its design. i bought this game in early access on the strength of mtap, and (frankly) i regret doing so.

2023-11-02,"[h3]kickstarter scam & poor-quality writing[/h3]


i see why this game could make a good first impression to people who never heard of pathea and their games before. graphics and npcs are nice to look at. unfortunately, that’s all.  

gameplay 3/10
difficulty 2/10
graphics 6/10
audio 3/10
story 1/10
sensitivity when it comes to serious topics (trauma, disabilities, death) 0/10
dev support 0/10
false promises 10/10

there sure were lots of problems with their previous game, my time at portia, devs simply weren’t capable to handle resources and promised way too much. the result was and still is an unpolished game full of bugs and missing content for several dateable npcs. console ports are still a mess too, although team17 and pingle are out for several years now and it was all up to pathea after this. last update in 2021 caused more problems than it solved and even more than 2 years later, pathea did nothing but announce some switch performance update. no actual update, no word about problems like missing items, stuck npcs, unplayable missions or fixes for playstation or xbox. they abandoned both, pc and console ports to work on sandrock instead.

there were many promises to learn from previous mistakes with portia and that everything would get better with sandrock. spoiler; [spoiler]it did not.[/spoiler] 

as other negative reviews already pointed out; sandrock kickstarter ended up being a scam.
many people backed because of 100k multiplayer stretch goal, which was easily reached. during early access the multiplayer actually did have story content for a while, just as devs promised. later, they suddenly decided to backtrack and removed it. their excuse; once more bit off more than they could chew and backers just have to accept this. no content, no chance for refund. 

there were more false promises during and after kickstarter. some examples;
- announced timespan for backers to share exclusive content was shortened
- all dateable npcs getting same amount of content - no, it ended up being the same as in mtap
- fixing none working kickstarter dlc codes - not for me
- promise to fix sensitive content - no

even if ignoring all of these mentioned above, i can still not recommend this game. devs took their previous game mtap, added desert location, more generic graphics, some new features and a different writing style. 

while simple gameplay and low difficulty are quite fitting for this genre, their storytelling is unbearable. memes, movie quotes, references, breaking the 4th wall, primitive thirst traps and puns galore, devs admitting at discord to copy entire npcs from disney and others. a ref or joke once in a while is nice though it’s far too much in this case. sandrock feels more like a parody or browsing social media rather than diving into a game with reliable npcs. also, very often those jokes are out of place or go way too far. for example;[spoiler]
- fake kidnapping a traumatized man’s pet to get his attention
- some npc pretending to be disabled because being too lazy to work 
- npc, who is worried their family member might die after already losing another one, is portrayed as fire spitting monster
- making corpulent npc a joke by adding ridiculous amount of food to his room[/spoiler]

devs also came up with the weirdest excuses for missing quality. like saying not to add optional (lol) voice acting for main character because they don’t want to limit players’ vision of their avatar too much. well, they actually don’t mind limiting our vision by bringing mc’s parents and childhood friend to the game, which of course is a way bigger limitation. 

writers are showing a huge lack in sensitivity and even made fun of some players at reddit and discord who brought up their sincere concerns. this behavior is mostly unprofessional.

writing also suffers from missing consistency; plot, timeline, even entire npcs. especially recurring npcs from mtap.

2023-11-02,"[h3]kickstarter scam & poor-quality writing[/h3]


i see why this game could make a good first impression to people who never heard of pathea and their games before. graphics and npcs are nice to look at. unfortunately, that’s all.  

gameplay 3/10
difficulty 2/10
graphics 6/10
audio 3/10
story 1/10
sensitivity when it comes to serious topics (trauma, disabilities, death) 0/10
dev support 0/10
false promises 10/10

there sure were lots of problems with their previous game, my time at portia, devs simply weren’t capable to handle resources and promised way too much. the result was and still is an unpolished game full of bugs and missing content for several dateable npcs. console ports are still a mess too, although team17 and pingle are out for several years now and it was all up to pathea after this. last update in 2021 caused more problems than it solved and even more than 2 years later, pathea did nothing but announce some switch performance update. no actual update, no word about problems like missing items, stuck npcs, unplayable missions or fixes for playstation or xbox. they abandoned both, pc and console ports to work on sandrock instead.

there were many promises to learn from previous mistakes with portia and that everything would get better with sandrock. spoiler; [spoiler]it did not.[/spoiler] 

as other negative reviews already pointed out; sandrock kickstarter ended up being a scam.
many people backed because of 100k multiplayer stretch goal, which was easily reached. during early access the multiplayer actually did have story content for a while, just as devs promised. later, they suddenly decided to backtrack and removed it. their excuse; once more bit off more than they could chew and backers just have to accept this. no content, no chance for refund. 

there were more false promises during and after kickstarter. some examples;
- announced timespan for backers to share exclusive content was shortened
- all dateable npcs getting same amount of content - no, it ended up being the same as in mtap
- fixing none working kickstarter dlc codes - not for me
- promise to fix sensitive content - no

even if ignoring all of these mentioned above, i can still not recommend this game. devs took their previous game mtap, added desert location, more generic graphics, some new features and a different writing style. 

while simple gameplay and low difficulty are quite fitting for this genre, their storytelling is unbearable. memes, movie quotes, references, breaking the 4th wall, primitive thirst traps and puns galore, devs admitting at discord to copy entire npcs from disney and others. a ref or joke once in a while is nice though it’s far too much in this case. sandrock feels more like a parody or browsing social media rather than diving into a game with reliable npcs. also, very often those jokes are out of place or go way too far. for example;[spoiler]
- fake kidnapping a traumatized man’s pet to get his attention
- some npc pretending to be disabled because being too lazy to work 
- npc, who is worried their family member might die after already losing another one, is portrayed as fire spitting monster
- making corpulent npc a joke by adding ridiculous amount of food to his room[/spoiler]

devs also came up with the weirdest excuses for missing quality. like saying not to add optional (lol) voice acting for main character because they don’t want to limit players’ vision of their avatar too much. well, they actually don’t mind limiting our vision by bringing mc’s parents and childhood friend to the game, which of course is a way bigger limitation. 

writers are showing a huge lack in sensitivity and even made fun of some players at reddit and discord who brought up their sincere concerns. this behavior is mostly unprofessional.

writing also suffers from missing consistency; plot, timeline, even entire npcs. especially recurring npcs from mtap. [spoiler]mint’s whole backstory and childhood were changed to promote qi, ginger became implausible careless, not following doctors’ advices anymore, gale prioritizes rather meaningless daily work over his precious daughter and leaves her behind, while the formerly cold, detached and standoffish gust now is loud, unjustifiably aggressive and violent to make players sympathize with director’s favorite npc fang, who is permanently portrayed as everyone’s victim.[/spoiler] which leads to another problem; playing favorites. if you’re not interested in sad novel trope fang or stereotype himbo logan, be aware your favorite npc doesn’t get much content since writers focus on those two heavily.

0/1, devs need to learn invisible walls are always bad design.  make interesting barriers or give an actual reason instead of invisible walls.

also, multiplayer feels like a completely different game than singleplayer.  there's not feature parity between the two, and many mechanics work differently for crafting and combat.

0/1, devs need to get feature consistency and parity between the two game modes.

movement is also very uncontrollable on keyboard and mouse.  my time at portia did movement better as your character had an infinitesimal turn radius, whereas in sandrock you will have a turn radius, which makes precision quite difficult.

0/1, devs need to revert the movement system to my time at portia.

the only thing this game has going so far is its multiplayer, because it's fun to strategize resource production.  however, my time at portia is the overall better game in very many respects.

2023-11-10,"unfinished, in my opinion. i would describe this as ""unity jank in perpetual early access"" 

the yawning blackness within doorways feels awkward. the music's abrupt shifts between scenes and loading screens add to the awkwardness. cut scenes feature jarring transitions. the concept of the ruins is goofy, with all the intellectual stimulation of one of those archaeology sand-treasure toys for toddlers. digging dirt towards an icon and walking through black doors, hitting buttons for more icons—repeat ad nauseam. fishing is oddly implemented. the repetitive, brown environment is a monotonous downer. two resources to manage for crafting: water and fuel. why? you don't have to do much to manage either of them so i just don't even understand why it exists other than bloat. the furniture is bulky, occupying too much space without purpose. the game lacks a clear identity, failing to embody a competent farming sim, resource management game, or social game. the kids in the game all give me the creeps.

the english localization is spotty with errors that should have been fixed long ago. in-game advertisements (with grammatical errors!!) direct to external websites, including amazon pages. they also beg for reviews via in-game advertisements. the inaccurate wiki diminishes the quality of available online information.

despite these issues, i'll persist in playing because i enjoy this genre. if i hadn't known it wasn't in early access, i would have unquestioningly believed it still was. if you have ""switch store bloatware"" standards for games, you will probably be fine with this release. i neither recommend nor advise against this game. 

it should 100% be cheaper though.

p.s. i forgot to add this stupidity: when you walk into the edge of the water, the entire screen goes black and then you reappear at the edge of the water. if you walk in a second time in the same place, your character gets teleported to the center of town. i'm guessing this is because they intended to implement swimming at some point but just couldn't figure it out and so you get teleported as a failsafe to prevent your character from getting stuck. honestly, what happened to invisible walls?",15092,Unfinished Opinion Unity Jank Perpetual Access Yawning Blackness Doorways Feels Awkward Music Abrupt Shifts Scenes Loading Screens Add Awkwardness Cut Scenes Feature Jarring Transitions Concept Ruins Goofy Intellectual Stimulation Archaeology Sand Treasure Toys Toddlers Digging Dirt Icon Walking Black Doors Hitting Buttons Icons Repeat Nauseam Fishing Oddly Implemented Repetitive Brown Environment Monotonous Downer Resources Manage Crafting Water Fuel Manage Understand Exists Bloat Furniture Bulky Occupying Space Purpose Game Lacks Identity Failing Embody Competent Farming Sim Resource Management Game Social Game Kids Game Creeps English Localization Spotty Errors Fixed Game Advertisements Grammatical Errors Direct External Websites Including Amazon Beg Reviews Game Advertisements Inaccurate Wiki Diminishes Quality Online Issues Persist Playing Enjoy Genre Access Unquestioningly Believed Switch Store Bloatware Standards Games Fine Release Recommend Advise Game 100 Cheaper Forgot Add Stupidity Walk Edge Water Entire Screen Black Reappear Edge Water Walk Time Character Teleported Center Town Guessing Intended Implement Swimming Figure Teleported Failsafe Prevent Character Stuck Honestly Happened Invisible Walls,NEGATIVE,0,1,58,16,0.7837837837837838

plus, getting logan's reverse proposal was a huge pain. he glitched during a cutscene and for some reason him and the builder couldn't approach the treasure chest with the ring in it. luckily, after several reloads, and approaching the quest point in a random number of ways, i finally got that one to progress. however, the bug with the north-south water diversion quest got me so infuriated, i deleted my game. at that point i had been doing so much running around trying to get things to trigger properly and losing hours of gameplay, my fun was completely gone, and the play through felt tainted.

adding another small bug. during chase the goat, if you have a horse, the goat will fall down the cliff slightly and stuck there. so have to return the horse before start the quest.

adding another side quest bug. ""leaving the nest"". if you ever choose ""not to talk to cooper"" (not accurate wording but similar meaning). the quest permanently stuck to visit clinic.

another annoying thing but not a bug. when trying to complete normal commission, some character like unsuur keeps teleport around. i was going to civil corps but he teleport to blue rock stage, then when i reached blue rock stage, he teleport to civil corps. then when i go to civil corps again, he teleport to church. ended there but i think it is super annoying just to give him item.",10875,Finished Game Bugs Fixed Future Thumbs Finished Air Mission Game Progressing Bugged Supposedly Gather Material Quest Skip Straight Wait Mi Creating Stuff Trigger Wait Day Waited Days Quest Triggered Progressing Load 3 Hours Happen Sell Required Item Sell Chromium Plate Progressing Comment Adding Bug Chase Goat Horse Goat Fall Cliff Stuck Return Horse Start Quest Adding Quest Bug Leaving Nest Choose Talk Cooper Accurate Wording Meaning Quest Permanently Stuck Visit Clinic Annoying Bug Complete Normal Commission Character Unsuur Teleport Civil Corps Teleport Blue Rock Stage Reached Blue Rock Stage Teleport Civil Corps Civil Corps Teleport Church Super Annoying Item,NEGATIVE,0,1,42,8,0.84

2023-11-12,"i recommend it but it has a lot of flaws.
clunky cinematics, npc teleporting themselves out of scenery. after 50 hours playtime the game started lagging, the time was slowed and every animation was delayed and 5/6/7 seconds longer than usual. very put me out of it when it happen unfortunately. (restarting the game doesn't really work, skipping day or sometime going in and out of an interior can work)

the storyline is.. surprising for this type of game but cool overall. the 2/3rd of the game was pretty smooth with quest almost everyday guiding you and providing you goals to go forward. 
when you've done almost all side content, the game consist of sleeping to trigger main events. (after 70h+ for me.) so i'm starting to get tired of it even tho' i have still a few things to do.

the game can be really immersive if you're into this kind of game. socializing and housing is nice. 
still wasn't able to romance the character of my choice after 120h playtime. i don't know why but the person was constantly refusing the necklace even tho the npc is indicated as a possible bachelor. since the character is used in main story, maybe it'll change in a few in-game days. 
i played a few of portia but here i felt more guided (in a good way). main mission in portia was like : firstly build a bus stop, then go upgrade all your workshop and tools then go build the bridge. 
here it's more build this, then this but it need a new ressource that you can find here, and that allows you to start upgrading gears and workshop without it to be instantly needed to continue. making you feel like you're the one choosing to upgrade stuff to go faster, provide new things etc.

i backed the game and played a few during alphas and betas so i'm a little disappointed to feel like the game is unpolished at this state.

2023-11-11,"do not buy, extremely buggy game.

i really enjoyed my time at portia (mtap), and found that sandrock (mtas) has extended much of the gameplay. the interaction system is fine, and the crafting system is basically identical. most of the game is good (hence my recent post-release play of ~90 hours (~20hrs was during the beta)). the fishing is so much better in mtas, it's a great improvement.

however, as the game goes on, more and more bugs arise. i've found that the game starts to chug after long play sessions (5+hrs) and needs to be restarted just to transition between scenes more smoothly. i've had several days where the game just hangs because when you leave your house in the morning it's supposed to cut to a cutscene, but the cutscene doesn't start, and so the game just sits on a black screen. sometimes restarting the game helped, otherwise i had to restart my computer (this indicates that mtas isn't releasing resources it finished using).

on the non-bugs front: the dialogue is often just bad. while i don't mean characters like unsuur who are just intentionally odd (and pretty funny), the entire bronco the kid arc is just immensely painful to play through. i appreciate that this was probably attempting to be silly, it's just a conversation that actual humans would never have with each other.

there are a lot of ""popins"" = graphics that just 'pop' into existence, but should have been there beforehand. exiting a building (eg the museum) leaves you standing outside an empty lot until the game loads in the building. this is not a modern fps, a quick look at the sceenshots will quickly show that the graphics in this game are very basic, no dlss in sight. yet buildings (and people) are often loaded in very slowly, taking 2-3 seconds to fully load each time you fast travel. this seems small until you realise that you will be fast travelling multiple times per day, every day, so this issue is constantly in your face.

npcs don't exist in the world. or rather, they do until they need to be somewhere else, and then they teleport. one of the things that i enjoyed in mtap was watching the townsfolk sprint across town to get to a gathering. in addition to being fun to watch, it also meant you could intercept them during their schedule to interact with them. this largely doesn't happen any more, they're simply teleported to where they need to be. this, frankly, is just absolute garbage, and leads to a bunch of issues.

an example: heidi and i are married in the game, and i have a quest to give her an item. according to my map, she's at the game centre, so i hop on my horse and head over there. as i approach the games centre, the quest marker jumps back to my workshop: she's there to pick up all the completed items from my machine. so i turnaround and head back to my workshop. as i pass the train station, the quest marker jumps *back* to the game centre: heidi finished her workshop tasks, and her schedule has her at the games centre so she teleports again.

in mtap, i would have met heidi on her way, but in mtas it's impossible.

in addition to that, npcs will just randomly teleport around. if you hang around the main square in front of the town hall, justice and trudy will just randomly materialise there. this is an entirely reasonable thing to do if npcs get stuck on objects, but 1) it's happening all the goddamn time, and 2) coco gets stuck on objects in my workshop all the time, yet never teleports.

this is before we talk about a game-breaking bug that has halted my current play. two events were supposed to occur on two different days, but the first didn't trigger on the correct day, so now they've both blended and are happening at the same time. this has caused the game to lose its sh~t, and spin my camera out into the desert, where it just sits and ignores all input from me.

all in all, this game is riddled with bugs, and has serious foundational flaws in its design. i bought this game in early access on the strength of mtap, and (frankly) i regret doing so.

2023-11-05,"nice game, would be better if the dev console wasn't rendered inaccessible upon full launch. don't get me wrong, pathea makes grinding fun more than a chore, but when your whole game revolves around grinding, god, you've got to let people choose to use console commands. i completely would get if the devs locked the console only for multiplayer, but why a total hard lock. once i complete the story and missions, sandrock will feel like a massive chore if i have to continue grinding just to do the things i actually want to be doing. 

tldr: sandrock now feels like a sandbox game without the sandbox mode. like playing in a sandbox without sand or attempting to swim in a pool without water. i can't recommend sandrock once more unless dev console is returned.


aside from that discrepancy, have some bullet points.

positive:

1.) very pretty game world, the town of sandrock and her people feel rich and enticing. although, diversity is what makes the world appealing, but that mostly ends if you stray any significant distance away from town or your workshop.

2.)romance feature in sandrock gets more ""worth it"" points compared to portia. i romanced unsuur, and his character arc was adorable and had me go from finding him irrelevant to him seeming like a wholesome, goofy character who i can strongly relate to. i cry when i see him in a sad or embarrassing sitch.

3.) house building. coming from a lifelong sims fanatic, sandrock's home building feature draws me in despite it having a sort of learning curve. i'm very dependent on mouse/keyboard when in building games, so its of note that sandrock's house builder catches my attention at all.

negative:

1.) despite its pastel-toned cartoonish vibe, sandrock can feel too immersive. grinding never gets genuinely less dreadful. machines require both water and fuel to operate, adding an extra thing to worry about despite adding nothing of value to the game. requiring fuel makes sense in a game like this, it serves as a subtle tactic to get the player to be actively involved in their workshop. requiring water as well looks good in terms of world design, but serves no purpose otherwise that fuel requirement wasn't already achieving.

2.) sandrock feels like a rich, vibrant world. sandrock also feels just as empty as it does to visit earth in starfield.  aside from story purposes, i felt no eagerness to explore new map areas. i rarely leave the confines of my workshop or the town itself. when i bought sandrock, the idea of it taking place in a desert allured me, it rendered in me that eager feeling to see what's out there. but after seeing what's ""out there"", i'm left feeling dissapointed that there wasn't more. no personality or variation in new map spaces. generally, ""all's the same"".",19735,Nice Game Dev Console Rendered Inaccessible Launch Wrong Pathea Grinding Fun Chore Game Revolves Grinding God People Choose Console Commands Completely Devs Locked Console Multiplayer Total Hard Lock Complete Story Missions Sandrock Feel Massive Chore Continue Grinding Tldr Sandrock Feels Sandbox Game Sandbox Mode Playing Sandbox Sand Attempting Swim Pool Water Recommend Sandrock Dev Console Returned Discrepancy Bullet Positive 1 Pretty Game Town Sandrock People Feel Rich Enticing Diversity Appealing Stray Distance Town Workshop 2 Romance Feature Sandrock Worth Compared Portia Romanced Unsuur Character Arc Adorable Finding Irrelevant Wholesome Goofy Character Relate Sad Embarrassing Sitch 3 House Building Coming Lifelong Sims Fanatic Sandrock Building Feature Draws Sort Learning Curve Dependent Mouse Keyboard Building Games Note Sandrock House Builder Catches Attention Negative 1 Pastel Toned Cartoonish Vibe Sandrock Feel Immersive Grinding Genuinely Dreadful Machines Require Water Fuel Operate Adding Extra Worry Adding Game Requiring Fuel Sense Game Serves Subtle Tactic Player Actively Involved Workshop Requiring Water Terms Design Serves Purpose Fuel Requirement Achieving 2 Sandrock Feels Rich Vibrant Sandrock Feels Visit Earth Starfield Story Purposes Eagerness Explore Map Rarely Leave Confines Workshop Town Bought Sandrock Idea Desert Allured Rendered Eager Feeling Left Feeling Dissapointed Personality Variation Map Spaces,NEGATIVE,0,1,49,11,0.8166666666666667

2023-11-02,"[h3]kickstarter scam & poor-quality writing[/h3]


i see why this game could make a good first impression to people who never heard of pathea and their games before. graphics and npcs are nice to look at. unfortunately, that’s all.  

gameplay 3/10
difficulty 2/10
graphics 6/10
audio 3/10
story 1/10
sensitivity when it comes to serious topics (trauma, disabilities, death) 0/10
dev support 0/10
false promises 10/10

there sure were lots of problems with their previous game, my time at portia, devs simply weren’t capable to handle resources and promised way too much. the result was and still is an unpolished game full of bugs and missing content for several dateable npcs. console ports are still a mess too, although team17 and pingle are out for several years now and it was all up to pathea after this. last update in 2021 caused more problems than it solved and even more than 2 years later, pathea did nothing but announce some switch performance update. no actual update, no word about problems like missing items, stuck npcs, unplayable missions or fixes for playstation or xbox. they abandoned both, pc and console ports to work on sandrock instead.

there were many promises to learn from previous mistakes with portia and that everything would get better with sandrock. spoiler; [spoiler]it did not.[/spoiler] 

as other negative reviews already pointed out; sandrock kickstarter ended up being a scam.
many people backed because of 100k multiplayer stretch goal, which was easily reached. during early access the multiplayer actually did have story content for a while, just as devs promised. later, they suddenly decided to backtrack and removed it. their excuse; once more bit off more than they could chew and backers just have to accept this. no content, no chance for refund. 

there were more false promises during and after kickstarter. some examples;
- announced timespan for backers to share exclusive content was shortened
- all dateable npcs getting same amount of content - no, it ended up being the same as in mtap
- fixing none working kickstarter dlc codes - not for me
- promise to fix sensitive content - no

even if ignoring all of these mentioned above, i can still not recommend this game. devs took their previous game mtap, added desert location, more generic graphics, some new features and a different writing style. 

while simple gameplay and low difficulty are quite fitting for this genre, their storytelling is unbearable. memes, movie quotes, references, breaking the 4th wall, primitive thirst traps and puns galore, devs admitting at discord to copy entire npcs from disney and others. a ref or joke once in a while is nice though it’s far too much in this case. sandrock feels more like a parody or browsing social media rather than diving into a game with reliable npcs. also, very often those jokes are out of place or go way too far. for example;[spoiler]
- fake kidnapping a traumatized man’s pet to get his attention
- some npc pretending to be disabled because being too lazy to work 
- npc, who is worried their family member might die after already losing another one, is portrayed as fire spitting monster
- making corpulent npc a joke by adding ridiculous amount of food to his room[/spoiler]

devs also came up with the weirdest excuses for missing quality. like saying not to add optional (lol) voice acting for main character because they don’t want to limit players’ vision of their avatar too much. well, they actually don’t mind limiting our vision by bringing mc’s parents and childhood friend to the game, which of course is a way bigger limitation. 

writers are showing a huge lack in sensitivity and even made fun of some players at reddit and discord who brought up their sincere concerns. this behavior is mostly unprofessional.

writing also suffers from missing consistency; plot, timeline, even entire npcs. especially recurring npcs from mtap. [spoiler]mint’s whole backstory and childhood were changed to promote qi, ginger became implausible careless, not following doctors’ advices anymore, gale prioritizes rather meaningless daily work over his precious daughter and leaves her behind, while the formerly cold, detached and standoffish gust now is loud, unjustifiably aggressive and violent to make players sympathize with director’s favorite npc fang, who is permanently portrayed as everyone’s victim.[/spoiler] which leads to another problem; playing favorites. if you’re not interested in sad novel trope fang or stereotype himbo logan, be aware your favorite npc doesn’t get much content since writers focus on those two heavily.

i gave pathea a chance and wanted to support their growth. there’s nothing wrong with making mistakes if you’re willing to learn from them and show process. quite disappointing, this isn’t the case with pathea and sandrock. same mistakes all over again and even adding new ones. this is why i can’t recommend this game.

coffee beans, but no coffee recipe?? what?
raspberries but no jams. 
these things can only be given as gifts, what is the actual point of growing them?!

so many dialog ""typos"" or mis translations into english.
random floating images not connected to anything, how is this actually out of ""early access""?

everytime you get an item that was not already in your bag, it is marked as new, which is annoying. it is not new, just not in the bag. stop it.

if you get to a timed event early, it wont start until you leave and come back, which i can kind of understand but also annoying. also you can't get there too late or you miss it. also annoying.

the events can stack up on the same days so you miss things. very frustating. the opening of the sand races happened on the same day as something else that happens as soon as you walk out the door and takes all day, so it was missed. :( 

the mini games and events have no instructions, so you waste time and money trying to figure it out. 

some quests have time restrctions, but don't list that. (installing the telescope can only be done at night).

tnone of the workbenches have any kind of filter to easily find items, and is not in alphabetical order making it a pia to find things. 

every other workstation but the cooking one, shows you how much you need to create of something to fulfill a request, and its so annoying that the cooking station does not do this. 

at some point you loose the ability to pick mushrooms, and only get spores to grow them which really sucks when you have a commission that needs them and you cannot possibly grow themin time, and no one i've found sells them. super fail on this one. 

game freezes after a big scene, and i really did not want to go through it all over again. this changed my thumbs up to a thumbs down. this should not be happening in a production release game. there are many posts about it, and they still didn't fix it. 

latest path broke the hover over item popup and it is such a thumbs down now. really wish there was a star rating instead of yes or no. would give it 3 out of 5 stars.

that being said, it is fun, if a little tedious trying to get the story line to move forward and get the requirements for the next set of upgrades needed to actually unlock the rest of the items.
such a great way to waste time. 

you can romance alot of people, haven't gotten as far as marrying any, but have dates with a lot of them though if you give them the same gift day after day they start to complain. and if you have multiple girl.boy friends and they see you on a date with another they get made and break up with you. 

the storage containers are all linked so you don't have to carry all the items around with you, except if you want to give your mount a treat, or have bait for fishing, you have to have in on you. so stupid. annoying to carry 5 or 6 baits for fishing, when and if they are even available. can't find one.

2023-11-10,"this game is enjoyable... it's better than my time at portia, but only barely. the writing is genuinely good and voice acting is great. the characters themselves look great as well. inventory is improved but i am not sure that warrants immense praise in a sequel, i would expect more mechanical improvements. the characters are definitely more demanding and engaged. some times i wish they would honestly shove off though, a lot of them are deeply self centered and narcissistic. it's an attempt to show a more realistic community i guess, but so many of them track anti-social and deeply narcissistic that i am not sure who i actually like in the town. kudos i guess on making it feel like i really am in a backwater trash town.

but i waited a long time for it to leave early access, and now i am playing a game that still feels like it is in early access. 

additionally, level design feels very strange. the over world feels janky and the dungeons half baked in design. a lot of areas blocked by invisible walls and lazy graphics.

the town itself is not particularly impressive and walking away from locations feels like i am walking on an unfinished map. many locations are deeply confusing to find and there are many absolutely pointless time wasting caves that have absolutely nothing in them except maybe a chest that drops a pointless piece of loot.

enemy's feel buggy and some of them are massively annoying to fight with a melee weapon. hyena's jump and move constantly, rat men spawn in the air and can't be attacked. combat is definitely more engineered from portia but it doesn't necessarily feel better chasing around a enemy that essentially non-stop roll dodges.

the denizens look better, but you look like a carnival clown. why are we still throwing utility pouches on things like they are 90s super heroes? why can't anyone make a decent pare of pants, i'm tired of running around in ill fitting shorts. i feel like you should be able to reskin the armor in the game to others you have unlocked. maybe that is a thing but it isn't apparent.

----

response to developer:
there are several instances where the corners of the paradise lost (i believe, first combat dungeon) has areas that look traversable that aren't. the fence going into paradise lost looks scalable. walking into the gecko station there is a large dead space around the entrance that can't be walked through, you have to approach the station entrance straight on dead center to enter. aside from that there are several areas that just seems empty though accessible including caves with little reward for exploring them. feels more like i am punished for exploring in a game at least partial about time management, i now default look up a guide the second i am confused. often the guide itself is confused like in the case with of the quest ""whispers of the heart"" where the streamer enters the cave thinking it might be where the quest location is. understandable since heidi appears to lead you there but then disappears (got stuck on terrain in my game) teleportating to the location but with no quest marker except a zone on the map. a quest with no timer listed but which logically does need to be completed that day and fails if not completed.

speaking of quests that need to be completed on time, there are a ton that auto trigger by walking into zones and they can overlap with other quests you have happening. perhaps you designed this to encourage players to not do quests saving them for future playthrough, but i don't think the majority of your users do play the game more than once. games this scale are huge timesinks and i would like to not decline side plot character arc stuff simply because i have 3 of them going simultaneously.the pacing of quests simply doesn't feel in line with the default speed of the game. i understand i can adjust this but i would like the game at least defaulting to an optimal experience. this likely goes into my feelings towards the townfolk being off putting, berating me with quests that really seem like they should be commissions (owen being the biggest offender though also not being told to stop like the others).

after experiencing the combat more i think the problem is the lack of mobility in the main character during a fight. you feel dark souls speed while everyone else (non-duel) feels like they are playing an arcade beat-em up.

i realize now there is a wardrobe tab, not sure how i missed it. apologies for that criticism. now i can wear my button up (with strange disco medalion/compass) and pants like a normie.

i think some of my irritation is the above mentioned side quest pacing. a lot of characters don't really grow much and feel very one sided in their relationship with you, qi in particular is deeply narcissistic and so central to the plot. there are definitely great characters but the ones who have big character flaws very rarely if ever showcase anything redeeming. would be satisfying to be able to get back at yan even a little and i have been playing the game for an in game year. arvio really needs to not be a screw up once in a while. amirah has 0 warmth even after being stuck making 50 fireworks for an event no one shows up to she responds to with a trailing ellipsis. i mean what is the player expectation here? if it's just the clique getting together to watch fireworks than why not have that happen? if it's a setup for a date why does amirah respond to even the most mild show of affection with a trailing ellipsis? how long do you want me to humor this fleeting youth club when they don't show up to their own events and, if it's a romance line, don't seem interested in you? i feel like i am doing a huge number of quests just to up relationship points, not because i enjoy them.

when's justice going to not be a failure riding off others? i'd love him to show some reason why anyone would want him as sheriff. miguel is a psycho. fang drugs me for his own amusement.

final complaint, clay and bloodstone are deeply relied on for commissions. they are very difficult to source without going back to the first dungeon or buying some from a store behind a loading screen. i have so much stone and sand at this point i could forge another sandrock in an effort to source clay and bloodstone and this is with me having built up a ton of bloodstone building a ridiculous field of moisture farms and needing the marble (p.s. please let us automate collection from these or something...).

2023-11-19,"this game is fun but incredibly flawed.

if you are hoping for fun characters and a good story, there is nothing really of merit here for you. the characters feel static or one dimensional and pretty forgettable. the story itself is kind of dry. i had no real investment in it as it seemed basic.

as far as gameplay go, i like it. i think having a management like farm like game is fun where you are constantly fighting for water. some things get tedious such as the critters minigame if you intend to maximize your relationships with the townspeople but it is rather unnecessary if you don't really care about it. you are punished for trying to build a lot of machines in your area which is fine. it's a nice touch to management.

i find the game laggy the more you play it as it starts chugging memory and causes loading times to be unreasonable. because of this, it causes a bunch of glitches such as invisible villagers, teleporting people and enemies and long long asset loading to where you need to pause. if you don't have enough space on your main hard drive, which i don't. i highly recommend skipping this game unless your computer can run a modded skyrim game with 200+ mods and i will say skyrim will still run better than this game.

it is because of the loading issues that i really can't recommend this game to anyone. i will say that in terms of game play it is better than rune factory 5 but in terms of world building and immersion this game pales in comparison.

2023-11-16,"this game is really, really fun. the characters are interesting, there's lots to do, plenty of fun world building.

however i would be lying to you if i didn't also say it's really janky. despite it being in full release now, it still plays a early access game. a really fun early access game with a lot of content, but still an early access game. i've had quests glitch out and repeat over and over. i've gotten softlocked in weird glitchy areas more than once. a fairly important recipe just straight up disappeared from my game with no way of restoring it.

there's also a lot of things that are just badly planned and balanced. storage is a nightmare. the tiny storage box you get at the beginning of the game is straight up the best you ever get. you cannot expand the storage. just make more and more tiny boxes. i saw a player in a thread casually commenting that they have fifty-two storage boxes. fifty-two. there is so much you need to store in this game that it doesn't even surprise me.

arguably the most important thing in the game, stamina, is also a disaster. there are recipes galore in this game offering every buff you can imagine, but almost none that give you stamina. i tried looking it up to see if later in the game we get something better, but late game players were still suggesting the almost useless berry recipe you, again, get right at the beginning of the game. one of those things gives you like 10 stamina. i'm pretty sure it takes more than 10 stamina to scavenge the just one of the easiest beginner scrap piles in the game. seemingly the only other better option is one specific medicine you can buy in a couple of places. you cannot make it yourself, and it isn't particularly cheap.

i'm also getting quests that require either immaculate timing to get done, or are literally completely impossible to do on time because getting ingredients/machines needed requires more time than is allotted. it's really frustrating to see the characters get all sad, or rub it in your face that they did it without you, when there was absolutely no way you could have completed the quest. it just straight up was not possible.

i want to finish this off by saying again that the game is really fun. i intend to keep playing it, and if you can handle a bit of frustrating jank i genuinely think it's a pretty entertaining time. but i'm really hoping that the developers will eventually address these issues, because as fun as this is, it would be a lot more fun without them.",11028,Game Fun Characters Lots Plenty Fun Building Lying Janky Release Plays Access Game Fun Access Game Lot Content Access Game Quests Glitch Repeat Softlocked Weird Glitchy Recipe Straight Disappeared Game Restoring Lot Badly Planned Balanced Storage Nightmare Tiny Storage Box Game Straight Expand Storage Tiny Boxes Player Thread Casually Commenting Storage Boxes Store Game Surprise Arguably Game Stamina Disaster Recipes Galore Game Offering Buff Imagine Stamina Game Late Game Players Suggesting Useless Berry Recipe Game Stamina Pretty Takes Stamina Scavenge Easiest Beginner Scrap Piles Game Seemingly Option Specific Medicine Couple Cheap Quests Require Immaculate Timing Literally Completely Impossible Time Ingredients Machines Requires Time Allotted Frustrating Characters Sad Rub Absolutely Completed Quest Straight Finish Game Fun Intend Playing Handle Bit Frustrating Jank Genuinely Pretty Entertaining Time Hoping Developers Eventually Address Issues Fun Lot Fun,NEGATIVE,0,1,35,4,0.8974358974358975

unfortunately the game is unplayable solo, i can play bg3 on ultra settings. but solo sandrocks loading screens take 10-15 minutes (sometimes longer) per interaction, sleep, leaving/entering the home, or literally anything in the game, including talking to npc's. i have barley any issues on multiplayer, other then the fact some areas/missions are impossible due to certain things missing in multi(but its playable).

i waited for the release because i was such a fan of the first one and even played via xbox live pass.

currently i am surfing the web for fixes, from uninstalling, reinstalling, turning cloud off, turning every setting to low, switching graphics cards/cpu's. mind you i have no other processes running, and can play other games that require so much more usage. currently re-verifying the files, in hopes i can play the game solo when my partner is not on, and not ruin our multiplayer game. 

currently i consider this game to be completely early access still, and unplayable for most. i found online via reddit, many people having the same issue. 

developers i am sorry but until this is fixed, this review will remain the same, as your product is extremely expensive and at least should run the basics like being able to leave/enter my home, or sleep without it taking 15+ minutes each thing.

2023-11-02,"you can spend a lot of time in sandrock, that’s for sure. it’s pretty addictive in fact, but, like most addictions, ultimately just not that much fun…

interactions with townsfolks and monster fights are trite and repetitive, as are most other day-to-day activities: refuel and dust off your equipment, run from place to place (the lack of 'quick travel' becomes tiresome quickly, especially combined with the clunky navigation system), go eat to replenish your extremely limited stamina, desperately try to dig your way to much-needed resources, try to get home before you collapse, rinse, repeat.

much of the game revolves around crafting items within a time limit, but all of these have recursive (and therefore pretty much unforeseeable) dependencies, as well as ""you need this resource, but you can’t get that just yet"" scenarios, making the supposedly-cute grind-breaking interludes that are forced on you from time to time more stressful than anything.

in the end, i had to abandon sandrock because bugs prevented some progress-blocking missions from being completed, and i realized i just didn’t feel like starting a new game in an attempt to set things right. and not starting the game is the best advice i can give prospective players: unless you truly enjoy the 'cow clicking' genre, it’s best to look elsewhere.",7446,Spend Lot Time Sandrock Pretty Addictive Addictions Ultimately Fun Interactions Townsfolks Monster Fights Trite Repetitive Day Day Activities Refuel Dust Equipment Lack Quick Travel Tiresome Combined Clunky Navigation Eat Replenish Extremely Limited Stamina Desperately Dig Resources Collapse Rinse Repeat Game Revolves Crafting Items Time Limit Recursive Pretty Unforeseeable Dependencies Resource Scenarios Supposedly Cute Grind Breaking Interludes Forced Time Time Stressful Abandon Sandrock Bugs Prevented Progress Blocking Missions Completed Realized Feel Starting Game Attempt Set Starting Game Advice Prospective Players Enjoy Cow Clicking Genre,NEGATIVE,0,1,63,15,0.8076923076923077
2023-11-25,"man, i was enjoying this game so much, as you can tell by the amount of hours i spent in it, but it really drops the ball story-wise and tone-wise somewhere midway through, and i just don't feel like continuing to play anymore. 

basically, a large portion of the story sets up certain characters as antagonists, but then it expects you to side with them because of a supposedly larger threat (even though said threat isn't as well-established throughout the game as the threat of these certain characters have been). seeing as the game doesn't have any story choices, you don't have a say in the matter. you can either agree to join a criminal gang or not be able to continue the main story anymore. 

following that, the story overall takes a wildly different tone from what the game has been so far. talks of war, invasions, and conspiracies would be fine in a different type of game, but for a game like this, which i believe presents itself as a cozy life sim, it seems really bizarre and unnecessary. i play these types of games to escape from depressing real-life topics like war and betrayal, so the game just stopped being fun and lost its charm for me.",11769,Enjoying Game Hours Spent Drops Ball Story Wise Tone Wise Midway Feel Continuing Play Basically Portion Story Sets Characters Antagonists Expects Supposedly Larger Threat Threat Established Game Threat Characters Game Story Choices Matter Agree Criminal Gang Continue Main Story Story Takes Wildly Tone Game Talks War Invasions Conspiracies Fine Type Game Game Cozy Life Sim Bizarre Unnecessary Play Types Games Escape Depressing Real Life Topics War Betrayal Game Stopped Fun Lost Charm,NEGATIVE,0,1,82,9,0.9010989010989011

2023-11-11,"do not buy, extremely buggy game.

i really enjoyed my time at portia (mtap), and found that sandrock (mtas) has extended much of the gameplay. the interaction system is fine, and the crafting system is basically identical. most of the game is good (hence my recent post-release play of ~90 hours (~20hrs was during the beta)). the fishing is so much better in mtas, it's a great improvement.

however, as the game goes on, more and more bugs arise. i've found that the game starts to chug after long play sessions (5+hrs) and needs to be restarted just to transition between scenes more smoothly. i've had several days where the game just hangs because when you leave your house in the morning it's supposed to cut to a cutscene, but the cutscene doesn't start, and so the game just sits on a black screen. sometimes restarting the game helped, otherwise i had to restart my computer (this indicates that mtas isn't releasing resources it finished using).

on the non-bugs front: the dialogue is often just bad. while i don't mean characters like unsuur who are just intentionally odd (and pretty funny), the entire bronco the kid arc is just immensely painful to play through. i appreciate that this was probably attempting to be silly, it's just a conversation that actual humans would never have with each other.

there are a lot of ""popins"" = graphics that just 'pop' into existence, but should have been there beforehand. exiting a building (eg the museum) leaves you standing outside an empty lot until the game loads in the building. this is not a modern fps, a quick look at the sceenshots will quickly show that the graphics in this game are very basic, no dlss in sight. yet buildings (and people) are often loaded in very slowly, taking 2-3 seconds to fully load each time you fast travel. this seems small until you realise that you will be fast travelling multiple times per day, every day, so this issue is constantly in your face.

npcs don't exist in the world. or rather, they do until they need to be somewhere else, and then they teleport. one of the things that i enjoyed in mtap was watching the townsfolk sprint across town to get to a gathering. in addition to being fun to watch, it also meant you could intercept them during their schedule to interact with them. this largely doesn't happen any more, they're simply teleported to where they need to be. this, frankly, is just absolute garbage, and leads to a bunch of issues.

an example: heidi and i are married in the game, and i have a quest to give her an item. according to my map, she's at the game centre, so i hop on my horse and head over there. as i approach the games centre, the quest marker jumps back to my workshop: she's there to pick up all the completed items from my machine. so i turnaround and head back to my workshop. as i pass the train station, the quest marker jumps *back* to the game centre: heidi finished her workshop tasks, and her schedule has her at the games centre so she teleports again.

in mtap, i would have met heidi on her way, but in mtas it's impossible.

in addition to that, npcs will just randomly teleport around. if you hang around the main square in front of the town hall, justice and trudy will just randomly materialise there. this is an entirely reasonable thing to do if npcs get stuck on objects, but 1) it's happening all the goddamn time, and 2) coco gets stuck on objects in my workshop all the time, yet never teleports.

this is before we talk about a game-breaking bug that has halted my current play. two events were supposed to occur on two different days, but the first didn't trigger on the correct day, so now they've both blended and are happening at the same time. this has caused the game to lose its sh~t, and spin my camera out into the desert, where it just sits and ignores all input from me.

all in all, this game is riddled with bugs, and has serious foundational flaws in its design. i bought this game in early access on the strength of mtap, and (frankly) i regret doing so.

2023-11-10,"this game is enjoyable... it's better than my time at portia, but only barely. the writing is genuinely good and voice acting is great. the characters themselves look great as well. inventory is improved but i am not sure that warrants immense praise in a sequel, i would expect more mechanical improvements. the characters are definitely more demanding and engaged. some times i wish they would honestly shove off though, a lot of them are deeply self centered and narcissistic. it's an attempt to show a more realistic community i guess, but so many of them track anti-social and deeply narcissistic that i am not sure who i actually like in the town. kudos i guess on making it feel like i really am in a backwater trash town.

but i waited a long time for it to leave early access, and now i am playing a game that still feels like it is in early access. 

additionally, level design feels very strange. the over world feels janky and the dungeons half baked in design. a lot of areas blocked by invisible walls and lazy graphics.

the town itself is not particularly impressive and walking away from locations feels like i am walking on an unfinished map. many locations are deeply confusing to find and there are many absolutely pointless time wasting caves that have absolutely nothing in them except maybe a chest that drops a pointless piece of loot.

enemy's feel buggy and some of them are massively annoying to fight with a melee weapon. hyena's jump and move constantly, rat men spawn in the air and can't be attacked. combat is definitely more engineered from portia but it doesn't necessarily feel better chasing around a enemy that essentially non-stop roll dodges.

the denizens look better, but you look like a carnival clown. why are we still throwing utility pouches on things like they are 90s super heroes? why can't anyone make a decent pare of pants, i'm tired of running around in ill fitting shorts. i feel like you should be able to reskin the armor in the game to others you have unlocked. maybe that is a thing but it isn't apparent.

----

response to developer:
there are several instances where the corners of the paradise lost (i believe, first combat dungeon) has areas that look traversable that aren't. the fence going into paradise lost looks scalable. walking into the gecko station there is a large dead space around the entrance that can't be walked through, you have to approach the station entrance straight on dead center to enter. aside from that there are several areas that just seems empty though accessible including caves with little reward for exploring them. feels more like i am punished for exploring in a game at least partial about time management, i now default look up a guide the second i am confused. often the guide itself is confused like in the case with of the quest ""whispers of the heart"" where the streamer enters the cave thinking it might be where the quest location is. understandable since heidi appears to lead you there but then disappears (got stuck on terrain in my game) teleportating to the location but with no quest marker except a zone on the map. a quest with no timer listed but which logically does need to be completed that day and fails if not completed.

speaking of quests that need to be completed on time, there are a ton that auto trigger by walking into zones and they can overlap with other quests you have happening. perhaps you designed this to encourage players to not do quests saving them for future playthrough, but i don't think the majority of your users do play the game more than once. games this scale are huge timesinks and i would like to not decline side plot character arc stuff simply because i have 3 of them going simultaneously.the pacing of quests simply doesn't feel in line with the default speed of the game. i understand i can adjust this but i would like the game at least defaulting to an optimal experience. this likely goes into my feelings towards the townfolk being off putting, berating me with quests that really seem like they should be commissions (owen being the biggest offender though also not being told to stop like the others).

after experiencing the combat more i think the problem is the lack of mobility in the main character during a fight. you feel dark souls speed while everyone else (non-duel) feels like they are playing an arcade beat-em up.

i realize now there is a wardrobe tab, not sure how i missed it. apologies for that criticism. now i can wear my button up (with strange disco medalion/compass) and pants like a normie.

i think some of my irritation is the above mentioned side quest pacing. a lot of characters don't really grow much and feel very one sided in their relationship with you, qi in particular is deeply narcissistic and so central to the plot. there are definitely great characters but the ones who have big character flaws very rarely if ever showcase anything redeeming. would be satisfying to be able to get back at yan even a little and i have been playing the game for an in game year. arvio really needs to not be a screw up once in a while. amirah has 0 warmth even after being stuck making 50 fireworks for an event no one shows up to she responds to with a trailing ellipsis. i mean what is the player expectation here? if it's just the clique getting together to watch fireworks than why not have that happen? if it's a setup for a date why does amirah respond to even the most mild show of affection with a trailing ellipsis? how long do you want me to humor this fleeting youth club when they don't show up to their own events and, if it's a romance line, don't seem interested in you? i feel like i am doing a huge number of quests just to up relationship points, not because i enjoy them.

when's justice going to not be a failure riding off others? i'd love him to show some reason why anyone would want him as sheriff. miguel is a psycho. fang drugs me for his own amusement.

final complaint, clay and bloodstone are deeply relied on for commissions. they are very difficult to source without going back to the first dungeon or buying some from a store behind a loading screen. i have so much stone and sand at this point i could forge another sandrock in an effort to source clay and bloodstone and this is with me having built up a ton of bloodstone building a ridiculous field of moisture farms and needing the marble (p.s. please let us automate collection from these or something...).

plus, getting logan's reverse proposal was a huge pain. he glitched during a cutscene and for some reason him and the builder couldn't approach the treasure chest with the ring in it. luckily, after several reloads, and approaching the quest point in a random number of ways, i finally got that one to progress. however, the bug with the north-south water diversion quest got me so infuriated, i deleted my game. at that point i had been doing so much running around trying to get things to trigger properly and losing hours of gameplay, my fun was completely gone, and the play through felt tainted.

2023-10-23,"[h3]wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle[/h3]

the #1 issue with this game is bloat. according to the devs, the story is 3.29 times longer than my time at portia – already a pretty long game, mind you. i know “more game” is supposed to be good, but sandrock overstays its welcome and makes you wonder when it finally ends. imagine watching a movie, and after an epic showdown with the main villain, when you’re ready for the credits to roll - another movie begins instead. it means you need many hours of your life to complete the story in one sitting and not lose track of it. there are more than twice side quests than portia, too - and most of them are on a timer. i ended up so overwhelmed by quests that i began refusing them at some point, which in turn led to a frustrating feeling of missing out on content. there is more of everything else as well. there are hundreds of items - scrap alone comes in like 15 varieties - making inventory management an ever-present annoying part of the gameplay. 

if a developer from pathea is reading this - i would like you to grab a sheet of paper, write “less is more” on it, then hang it somewhere in the office where everyone can see it every day. i have no need for 20 romantic interests in the game, if the majority of them will lack character, quests, unique items, voice acting... give me just 3 but make them really fleshed out and rich with content. case in point: nia - she got so much backstory, relevance to the plot, unique events and ties to the main character that she makes every other romance look like an unnecessary waste of development resources.

[h3]cardboard protagonist[/h3]

sandrock is a heavily narrative-driven game. for 100-150 hours you will be listening to dialogue with multiple people, constantly referencing your character. for some reason, even though your character is not a “blank slate” and has a backstory, parents, childhood friend etc. you are free to name him/her whatever you want. this creates a huge problem for voice actors. you see, expecting them to voice dozens of custom names like codsworth or vasco would be unrealistic, so they only had two options - either skip the player character’s name entirely, or to use generic “the builder”. as a result, dialogue constantly loses meaning and feels jarring. for example, “me, harris and you will go to the cave” turns into “me and you will go to the cave”; “s.s. harris” (ship name) turns into “s.s.” (???), and even though you can be a best friend to people and marry them, they will still refer to you as “the builder” (even if there are other builders present in the same scene). 

what exacerbates this issue is the silent protagonist. which on its own perhaps wouldn’t be that bad - if mi-an didn’t exist. mi-an is also a builder, and so in most scenes she effectively speaks for both of you and ends up praised for things you did. all leading to a feeling of the player character being a sidekick to mi-an. while i realize voicing the whole 250.000 words main story is unrealistic, this just leads back to my point - why did they write a huge story like that?

[h3]howdy, pardner![/h3]

sandrock feels awfully derivative - it just grabs about every single gameplay element and design decision from portia and carefully copy/pastes them into a new game. the only meaningful difference here is the new desert setting, and frankly - it’s terrible and doesn’t work for a game like this. you will struggle to tell the seasons apart - it’s always just sand, with the (very) subtle coat of white in winter and green in spring. outside of an occasional sandstorm the weather is also static for the most part – you will not see any snow and i only witnessed rain 1 (one!) time after 100+ hours into the game. of course, there are setting-based complications: like you need water (rare and expensive) to cool your machines; sand accumulates on them over time so you need to clean it; you are not allowed to chop trees near the city etc. however, ultimately all of it feels like busywork, aimed at making your early game more painful and tedious than it needs to be.

narratively, it’s just a mix of every wild west cliché. your will hear “howdy!” from about every character, even the newcomers. there are sheriffs, bandits, cowb... i mean, yakboys. which i could probably live with, but the huge appeal of a my time game is to be able to improve your community and see a meaningful impact of your actions over time. i still remember building a fast travel system in portia and how much of an achievement it felt. here the main theme is greenification of the desert however, which essentially makes you feel like a sidekick to botanist characters and a glorified gardener, as the builder stuff takes a backstage to planting trees. furthermore, the first half of the exceedingly long story just has you doing barely meaningful stuff, with the common theme being “bandits broke our bench/water tower/farm/statue - please repair it!”. yes, there are guns now - but they feel like a gimmick, requiring entering an “aiming” mode, and are so ammo-hungry that using them is just not sustainable, unless you enjoy grinding mines to make more bullets. you do get the ability to join civil corps as a deputy this time round, but ultimately this only serves to further distract you into becoming a “jack of all trades”.

[h3]rpg and progression[/h3]

sandrock tries to be more of an rpg, with everything from your chair to your horse coming in multiple tiers of quality. you can also “refine” an item to increase its level and quality by throwing rare gems you first have to grind at it. at first i thought this to be a very cool system, as i imagined it would be possible to upgrade any piece of clothing indefinitely and make it competitive in the late game - but you’re only able to upgrade anything up to 10 levels above its “required level”, making the system pointless. furthermore, this system only made matters worse as for the first half of the game i had to actively avoid the “blue” quality commissions - because i simply did not have the required gems at the time to make such quality items.

also, while there are levels and skill points – you will easily unlock everything provided you play long enough, so there are no builds or anything like that. the perks are subtle buffs rather than something that has great impact over the gameplay. as such, the main form of progression comes in the form of gear - and is fully tied to the main story, which unlocks more areas and resources. while you unlock bronze and iron relatively early on and at a steady pace, it is unfortunately followed by a very long and stale midgame where you don’t unlock anything until late game, where you get chromium and aluminum almost back to back.

[h3]writing[/h3]

sandrock is filled to the brim with memes and popular culture references, and every quest title is an attempt at a witty pun. it all looks quaint and fun at first, but quickly grows exhausting, especially as the writers make npc go more and more out of character just to throw in another “mic drop!”. the writing feels too concerned with the “current day” agenda for a game that’s supposed to take place in a post apocalyptic setting. for example, a woman i offered my help said she does not accept “free help” from strangers, and almost reported me for sexual harassment. and after that a homosexual man made advances on my male character without my consent, or ever speaking to that particular character to begin with. some characters are so obnoxious i found it really hard to co-exist with them in the same game.

[h3]tl;dr upgrade? more like side-grade![/h3]

my time at sandrock was almost 200 hours full of adventure and emotions. just like portia, this game has quite a few enjoyable things. pretty graphics, some quality of life additions, even the optimization is finally half-decent! unfortunately, all the diamonds are buried deeply under the sand of a game that is too ambitious for its own good.

2023-11-11,"do not buy, extremely buggy game.

i really enjoyed my time at portia (mtap), and found that sandrock (mtas) has extended much of the gameplay. the interaction system is fine, and the crafting system is basically identical. most of the game is good (hence my recent post-release play of ~90 hours (~20hrs was during the beta)). the fishing is so much better in mtas, it's a great improvement.

however, as the game goes on, more and more bugs arise. i've found that the game starts to chug after long play sessions (5+hrs) and needs to be restarted just to transition between scenes more smoothly. i've had several days where the game just hangs because when you leave your house in the morning it's supposed to cut to a cutscene, but the cutscene doesn't start, and so the game just sits on a black screen. sometimes restarting the game helped, otherwise i had to restart my computer (this indicates that mtas isn't releasing resources it finished using).

on the non-bugs front: the dialogue is often just bad. while i don't mean characters like unsuur who are just intentionally odd (and pretty funny), the entire bronco the kid arc is just immensely painful to play through. i appreciate that this was probably attempting to be silly, it's just a conversation that actual humans would never have with each other.

there are a lot of ""popins"" = graphics that just 'pop' into existence, but should have been there beforehand. exiting a building (eg the museum) leaves you standing outside an empty lot until the game loads in the building. this is not a modern fps, a quick look at the sceenshots will quickly show that the graphics in this game are very basic, no dlss in sight. yet buildings (and people) are often loaded in very slowly, taking 2-3 seconds to fully load each time you fast travel. this seems small until you realise that you will be fast travelling multiple times per day, every day, so this issue is constantly in your face.

npcs don't exist in the world. or rather, they do until they need to be somewhere else, and then they teleport. one of the things that i enjoyed in mtap was watching the townsfolk sprint across town to get to a gathering. in addition to being fun to watch, it also meant you could intercept them during their schedule to interact with them. this largely doesn't happen any more, they're simply teleported to where they need to be. this, frankly, is just absolute garbage, and leads to a bunch of issues.

an example: heidi and i are married in the game, and i have a quest to give her an item. according to my map, she's at the game centre, so i hop on my horse and head over there. as i approach the games centre, the quest marker jumps back to my workshop: she's there to pick up all the completed items from my machine. so i turnaround and head back to my workshop. as i pass the train station, the quest marker jumps *back* to the game centre: heidi finished her workshop tasks, and her schedule has her at the games centre so she teleports again.

in mtap, i would have met heidi on her way, but in mtas it's impossible.

in addition to that, npcs will just randomly teleport around. if you hang around the main square in front of the town hall, justice and trudy will just randomly materialise there. this is an entirely reasonable thing to do if npcs get stuck on objects, but 1) it's happening all the goddamn time, and 2) coco gets stuck on objects in my workshop all the time, yet never teleports.

this is before we talk about a game-breaking bug that has halted my current play. two events were supposed to occur on two different days, but the first didn't trigger on the correct day, so now they've both blended and are happening at the same time. this has caused the game to lose its sh~t, and spin my camera out into the desert, where it just sits and ignores all input from me.

all in all, this game is riddled with bugs, and has serious foundational flaws in its design. i bought this game in early access on the strength of mtap, and (frankly) i regret doing so.

2023-11-10,"this game is enjoyable... it's better than my time at portia, but only barely. the writing is genuinely good and voice acting is great. the characters themselves look great as well. inventory is improved but i am not sure that warrants immense praise in a sequel, i would expect more mechanical improvements. the characters are definitely more demanding and engaged. some times i wish they would honestly shove off though, a lot of them are deeply self centered and narcissistic. it's an attempt to show a more realistic community i guess, but so many of them track anti-social and deeply narcissistic that i am not sure who i actually like in the town. kudos i guess on making it feel like i really am in a backwater trash town.

but i waited a long time for it to leave early access, and now i am playing a game that still feels like it is in early access. 

additionally, level design feels very strange. the over world feels janky and the dungeons half baked in design. a lot of areas blocked by invisible walls and lazy graphics.

the town itself is not particularly impressive and walking away from locations feels like i am walking on an unfinished map. many locations are deeply confusing to find and there are many absolutely pointless time wasting caves that have absolutely nothing in them except maybe a chest that drops a pointless piece of loot.

enemy's feel buggy and some of them are massively annoying to fight with a melee weapon. hyena's jump and move constantly, rat men spawn in the air and can't be attacked. combat is definitely more engineered from portia but it doesn't necessarily feel better chasing around a enemy that essentially non-stop roll dodges.

the denizens look better, but you look like a carnival clown. why are we still throwing utility pouches on things like they are 90s super heroes? why can't anyone make a decent pare of pants, i'm tired of running around in ill fitting shorts. i feel like you should be able to reskin the armor in the game to others you have unlocked. maybe that is a thing but it isn't apparent.

----

response to developer:
there are several instances where the corners of the paradise lost (i believe, first combat dungeon) has areas that look traversable that aren't. the fence going into paradise lost looks scalable. walking into the gecko station there is a large dead space around the entrance that can't be walked through, you have to approach the station entrance straight on dead center to enter. aside from that there are several areas that just seems empty though accessible including caves with little reward for exploring them. feels more like i am punished for exploring in a game at least partial about time management, i now default look up a guide the second i am confused. often the guide itself is confused like in the case with of the quest ""whispers of the heart"" where the streamer enters the cave thinking it might be where the quest location is. understandable since heidi appears to lead you there but then disappears (got stuck on terrain in my game) teleportating to the location but with no quest marker except a zone on the map. a quest with no timer listed but which logically does need to be completed that day and fails if not completed.

speaking of quests that need to be completed on time, there are a ton that auto trigger by walking into zones and they can overlap with other quests you have happening. perhaps you designed this to encourage players to not do quests saving them for future playthrough, but i don't think the majority of your users do play the game more than once. games this scale are huge timesinks and i would like to not decline side plot character arc stuff simply because i have 3 of them going simultaneously.the pacing of quests simply doesn't feel in line with the default speed of the game. i understand i can adjust this but i would like the game at least defaulting to an optimal experience. this likely goes into my feelings towards the townfolk being off putting, berating me with quests that really seem like they should be commissions (owen being the biggest offender though also not being told to stop like the others).

after experiencing the combat more i think the problem is the lack of mobility in the main character during a fight. you feel dark souls speed while everyone else (non-duel) feels like they are playing an arcade beat-em up.

i realize now there is a wardrobe tab, not sure how i missed it. apologies for that criticism. now i can wear my button up (with strange disco medalion/compass) and pants like a normie.

i think some of my irritation is the above mentioned side quest pacing. a lot of characters don't really grow much and feel very one sided in their relationship with you, qi in particular is deeply narcissistic and so central to the plot. there are definitely great characters but the ones who have big character flaws very rarely if ever showcase anything redeeming. would be satisfying to be able to get back at yan even a little and i have been playing the game for an in game year. arvio really needs to not be a screw up once in a while. amirah has 0 warmth even after being stuck making 50 fireworks for an event no one shows up to she responds to with a trailing ellipsis. i mean what is the player expectation here? if it's just the clique getting together to watch fireworks than why not have that happen? if it's a setup for a date why does amirah respond to even the most mild show of affection with a trailing ellipsis? how long do you want me to humor this fleeting youth club when they don't show up to their own events and, if it's a romance line, don't seem interested in you? i feel like i am doing a huge number of quests just to up relationship points, not because i enjoy them.

when's justice going to not be a failure riding off others? i'd love him to show some reason why anyone would want him as sheriff. miguel is a psycho. fang drugs me for his own amusement.

final complaint, clay and bloodstone are deeply relied on for commissions. they are very difficult to source without going back to the first dungeon or buying some from a store behind a loading screen. i have so much stone and sand at this point i could forge another sandrock in an effort to source clay and bloodstone and this is with me having built up a ton of bloodstone building a ridiculous field of moisture farms and needing the marble (p.s. please let us automate collection from these or something...).
